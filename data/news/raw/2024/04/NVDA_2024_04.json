        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the second-biggest maker of computer processors, gave a lukewarm revenue forecast for the current period, weighed down by lackluster demand for chips used in video game hardware.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Binance and CZ’s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Even in Jail Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System Wall Street Hit by Fed Jitters to Close Wild April: Markets Wrap Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter\n\nSecond-quarter revenue will be approximately $5.7 billion, the company said in a statement Tuesday. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $5.72 billion.\n\nRevenue from AMD’s gaming division fell well short of projections last quarter, but the company is expecting to get a boost from a push into AI accelerators — Nvidia Corp.-style chips that help develop chatbots and other artificial intelligence tools. The company has projected that its new MI300 products will generate as much as $3.5 billion of revenue this year.\n\n“This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in the statement.\n\nAMD shares fell more than 4% in late trading after the results were released. The stock had closed at $158.38 on Tuesday, up 7.4% for the year.\n\nThe AMD report follows a downbeat forecast last week from Intel Corp., which said it expects demand to remain sluggish in the first half of the year. But AMD is still expecting growth in the range of 6% in the current quarter, better than the roughly flat projection of its larger rival.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings were 62 cents a share, excluding some items, on revenue was $5.47 billion. That performance compared with an estimated 61 cents in profit and $5.45 billion in sales.\n\nAMD’s PC chip division had revenue of about $1.4 billion, compared with a $1.29 billion estimate. Data center sales came in at $2.3 billion, in line with the average projection. Gaming computer-related revenue, meanwhile, was $922 million. Analysts had expected sales of $965.5 million.\n\nLike Intel, AMD still gets most of its revenue from personal computer and server microprocessors. The once-solid server market has been less reliable recently because data center operators have plowed much of their budgets into Nvidia chips — the very area AMD is now making its own play for.\n\nInvestors betting on AMD’s AI prospects had set off a rally earlier this year, though the stock cooled in recent months. The announcement of a next-generation Nvidia chip has weighed on the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD also competes with Nvidia in the market for graphics processors that improve the images in video games. It’s the biggest rival of Intel in both server and PC processors — as well as in programmable logic chips, which can be reconfigured with software after they’re installed. And it supplies Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. with the main component in their game consoles.\n\nAMD said that its gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — will be about 53% in the second quarter, matching predictions.\n\n(Updates with more from report starting in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India’s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Adds shares in paragraph 2, revenue forecast in paragraph 8, background throughout)\n\nApril 30 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices beat first-quarter revenue estimates by a small margin on Tuesday as tepid demand for semiconductors used in traditional data centers added to weakness in the market for gaming chips.\n\nShares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell 3% in extended trading.\n\nEnterprises rushing to adopt generative AI have prioritized spending on AI server chips, hitting demand for traditional server semiconductors, which constitute a large portion of AMD's revenue. These processors cannot effectively handle the complex tasks associated with AI.\n\nWhile some of AMD's central processors are used in conjunction with AI chips, the ratio is skewed in favor of the more advanced processors.\n\nAMD trails front-runner Nvidia in the booming market for artificial intelligence server semiconductors, where Nvidia commands about 80% of the share.\n\nUncertain demand from the gaming market has further hurt AMD. Personal computing and console gaming revenue growth is expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels through 2026, according to research firm Newzoo.\n\nWeakness has also evaded AMD's embedded segment, which caters to markets such as automotive and industrial. Ongoing inventory corrections have hit revenue from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million, for the second quarter, in line with analysts' average estimate, according to LSEG data.\n\nIt reported revenue of $5.47 billion for the first quarter, compared to analysts' average estimate of $5.46 billion.

        "title": "3 Speculative Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (if You Dare)",
        "content": "Speculation is rife in the market right now and there are plenty of risky stocks for investors to gamble on in an attempt to make a fortune. This is especially true as the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has returned after two difficult years for new stock issuance. According to data from EY, the global IPO market ended 2023 with 1,298 listings that, combined, raised $123.20 billion. That was down 47% from the record number of IPOs held in 2021 when global markets last peaked.\n\nHowever, since September 2023, we have seen several high-profile IPOs from companies ranging from German sandal maker Birkenstock (NYSE:BIRK) to semiconductor concern Astera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB). Newly listed companies are, by their nature, speculative investments. Beyond the return of IPOs, there are several established stocks that remain volatile and hard to predict, from cryptocurrency miners such as Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) to electric vehicle makerTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nHere are three speculative stocks that could make you a fortune (if you dare).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRubrik (RBRK) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIt just went public and it’s hard to know where the stock is headed, but investors with an appetite for risk might want to consider data software company Rubrik (NYSE:RBRK). The company’s share price rose 16% during its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange following a successful initial public offering (IPO) on April 25. Since then, RBRK stock has fallen 6%. Investors might want to buy the dip in the company, which has the backing of tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others.\n\nRubrik sold 23.5 million shares at a valuation of $5.60 billion. The data management software maker raised $752 million from the IPO. Like most start-ups that go public, Rubrik is unprofitable.\n\nFounded in 2014, the company reported a net loss of $354 million in its latest fiscal year, compared with a $278 million loss the previous year. The company generates 91% of its revenue from subscription fees. Microsoft has been an investor in Rubrik since it was still privately held in 2021.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock continues to lead the benchmark S&P 500 index, having tripled its share price year to date. SMCI stock is up 209% since January, although it has pulled back 15% during the month of April, opening up a potential buying opportunity for investors with nerves of steal. Super Micro Computer’s stock has been on a blistering rally, increasing 740% in the last 12 months alone. The company has grown so quickly that it was recently added to the S&P 500 for the first time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe previous small cap company makes data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI). Super Micro’s market capitalization has soared from $4.50 billion at the end of 2022 to more than $50 billion today.\n\nSMCI stock really took off a year ago after the company announced a partnership with leading microchip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While the rapid gains are impressive, this stock comes with risks. Super Micro Computer is one of the most shorted stocks, with traders betting the share price will decline.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit logo displayed on a smartphone device. RDDT stock\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) held its IPO in late March, and while the share offering was oversubscribed and viewed as a success, the company’s shares have since pulled back about 6% after initially jumping in their market debut. Reddit, which runs online message boards and discussion forums, was one of the most high-profile IPOs of the past few years and the first social media company to go public since Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) in 2019.\n\nLike Rubrik, Reddit is unprofitable. While Reddit’s revenue grew 20% in 2023 to $804 million, the company posted a net loss last year of $90.8 million. Analysts have initiated coverage of RDDT stock with a consensus rating of “moderate buy.”\n\nThe average price target on the stock is is $49.20, which is about 4% higher than current levels. Achieving profitability and demonstrating continued growth will be key for Reddit when it issues its first earnings print as a public company on May 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is still continuing. Many leading AI stocks extended their gains in 2024 and attracted new investors. Tech giants have been reporting solid financials while crediting AI.\n\nAI is in its early innings and offers a lot of promise. However, the innovative technology has also created a great deal of speculation. Some corporations are rushing to mention AI efforts with the hopes of keeping their stock prices steady. Successes from some AI stocks can also result in unjustified gains for other companies. Investors may want to steer clear of these AI stocks.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) offers voice AI solutions for business owners. The service can help companies create better customer experiences. It’s similar to giving automated chatbots a voice instead of only text.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm allows businesses to save money on costs and scale their efforts. However, the company is burning through a lot of cash and doesn’t have enough revenue to justify its $1.3 billion valuation.\n\nThe full-year revenue growth came in at 47% year-over-year (YoY). The growth rate brought the firm’s total revenue to $45.9 million. SoundHound AI reported a net loss of $88.9 million in the full year 2023. It’s an improvement from last year’s $116 million net loss, but these are still high numbers.\n\nThe stock has more than doubled year-to-date, but not due to its own merit. Investors rushed to buy shares after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed it had a small stake in the company. Market participants are now running away from the stock, as it’s down by more than 50% from its all-time high.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3IoT (AI) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is another overvalued AI stock. It hasn’t enjoyed the same love as SoundHound AI, since C3.ai shares are down by 19% year-to-date. However, the stock had one week in February where it surged by more than 40%, so there’s still plenty of speculation for the $2.8 billion firm.\n\nThe C3.ai platform helps enterprises develop AI applications. It’s competing with the tech giants and isn’t gaining much market share. Revenue increased by 18% YoY to reach $66.7 million in Q3 FY24. However, net losses inched higher from $63.2 million in Q3 FY23 to $72.6 million in the most recent quarter. Net losses also increased over the nine-month period that ended on January 31.\n\nThe stock doesn’t look sustainable. Cash and cash equivalents were cut in half YoY. A corporation is unlikely to generate returns if revenue growth decelerates and losses continue to grow. C3.ai checks both of those boxes and isn’t a good AI stock for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) BigBear.ai (BBAI) is a leading provider of high-speed decision-making technologies. They specialize in AI-driven analytics and solutions for critical missions\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nBigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI) offers AI-powered decision intelligence solutions for its clients. The speculative stock’s value more than doubled in roughly two weeks from the end of February to early March. However, shares have given up those gains and are down by roughly 86% from their all-time highs. Shares are down by more than 80% over the past five years as a result of yet another SPAC gone wrong.\n\nThe company’s financials resemble a sinking ship rather than a growing company. Revenue only grew by 0.5% YoY to $40.6 million. The AI firm also reported a net loss of $21.3 million. Revenue only ticked up by 0.01% YoY for the full year 2023.\n\nBigBear.ai currently trades at a 1.68 price-to-sales ratio. It’s low for a reason as the company seems several years away from profitability if it ever reaches that milestone. Corporations that are supposed to be in growth mode don’t have as many opportunities to improve their profit margins, especially if revenue growth remains flat.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Virtual Reality Stocks Worth Strapping Into Now",
        "content": "The virtual reality (VR) stocks and trends are lukewarm, even cold, compared to just a few years ago. Undoubtedly, the big tech titans, including some Magnificent Seven firms you may be familiar with, have been doing their best to advance the field. And though there have been setbacks and limited uptake in new headsets to this day, don’t expect the frontrunning VR stocks to walk away from the dream of digital reality, even if the road to mainstream adoption is more than seven years away.\n\nWhile VR headsets may be nothing new, recent hardware advancements and the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) could set the stage for a future reignition in metaverse-related investor interest. However, it will take some time before metaverse-tied R&D translates to growth metrics that attract analysts’ attention.\n\nRegardless, every step forward in on-device processing power and generative AI could mean several steps forward in spatial computing. And with that, here are three VR stocks that may entice everyday consumers to put down their phones and strap into their headsets in as little as a few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock returns after briefly flirting with a bear market. Now up over 15% in around two weeks, many investors wonder if there’s another leg higher for the number-one AI hardware stock.\n\nBig-name analyst Ben Reitzes of Melius Research seems to think NVDA stock is a no-brainer buy on recent weakness. After hiking his price target to $1,125 from $1,000 in response to the ongoing GPU “gold rush,” he makes a pretty strong case for picking up a few shares on weakness as the public cloud continues sparing no expense at this point in the AI boom.\n\nLooking further ahead, Nvidia is a potentially massive VR and AR enabler with its Omniverse platform and VRWorks suite. Indeed, many of us tend to concentrate on the headset makers themselves as the top VR players. But let’s not lose sight of the firms putting the tools in the hands of creators.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see if Nvidia can lead the masses into VR. If Omniverse is that new growth avenue, perhaps it’s about time we view the firm as more than just a GPU maker in the right place at the right time.\n\nSony (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY) is probably the best VR headset stock to buy for the future of gaming. Some firms view the enterprise as the major source of early VR growth. Enterprise firms have more money to spend on such emerging tech!\n\nStory continues\n\nSony is more concerned with capturing demand from everyday consumers looking to explore the next frontier in video gaming. At this juncture, I view Sony as the VR play that investors should pursue if they believe play, not work, will be the top reason people strap on a headset.\n\nThe company’s PlayStation VR (PSVR) headset has been intriguing for quite a while now. Though the latest PSVR 2 headset, launched more than a year ago, maybe one of the best gaming-focused VR devices on the market, it’s been hit with some sluggish sales recently.\n\nEven with price hikes thrown in, demand has ground down enough to cause Sony to halt production until it has a chance to clear some inventory. Such news has caused an overhang in the stock lately. Still, I find PSVR 2 demand weakness more tied to industry softness than anything specific to Sony.\n\nAs more games are released while consumer wallets are replenished, one has to think sales will pick up again. At 18.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), SONY stock looks like a great buy on the year-to-date dip.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) stock has been a year-to-date laggard that’s really struggled to gain ground after crumbling back in early 2022. Despite the long growth runway ahead, with ample investment in developer tools and generative AI, many investors seem to be growing impatient over the firm’s lack of profits. Undoubtedly, Roblox still seems more focused on growth than cutting its way to better profitability.\n\nGoldman Sachs’ Eric Sheridan may not be a raging bull on RBLX stock, but he does see the firm as a “well-positioned company” to play the “metaverse and creator economy themes.” Indeed, Sheridan hit the spot with Roblox. You’re gaining exposure to two hot themes with one battered stock.\n\nAs intriguing as the company’s VR prospects are (Roblox launched its beta VR app last summer), I think its creator economy will receive a huge boost as it continues rolling out new AI tools.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AXT (AXTI) to Announce Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "AXT AXTI is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 2.\r\n\r\nAXT initially expected net sales to be $20-$22 million in the first quarter of 2024. The company later revised its guidance on Apr 8, 2024, and announced that it now expects revenues to increase by $22.4-$22.7 million, exceeding the company’s prior guidance.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $21 million, indicating an improvement of 8.19% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 6-8 cents per share. The consensus mark for loss has remained unchanged at 8 cents in the past 30 days.\n\nAXT Inc Price and EPS Surprise AXT Inc Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAXT Inc price-eps-surprise | AXT Inc Quote\n\nAXT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 25.96%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for AXT prior to this announcement.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nAXT’s first quarter 2024 results are expected to have benefited from increasing demand in indium phosphide and gallium arsenide substrates driven by increased demand in various applications, including artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, wireless switches, LEDs and high-power lasers.\r\n\r\nExpanding demand for AI-related applications, particularly in the realm of data transfer and processing, is anticipated to have acted as a tailwind. As AI drives the need for rapid data transfer with increased bandwidth, AXT's indium phosphide substrates are well-positioned to meet this demand owing to their optimal characteristics for high-speed data transfer.\r\n\r\nAXTI is likely to have benefited from new demand in the gallium arsenide market, particularly in Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) applications, indicating diversification in its customer base during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nStrengthening international footprint is expected to have remained a key factor in driving AXTI’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s improving demand in China across various applications, including LEDs, wireless switches and high-power lasers, is likely to have driven growth in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across its developed eight-inch gallium arsenide wafers for LED applications like microLED is expected to have bolstered BBAI’s performance in the first quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nAXT has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\r\n\r\nArista Networks ANET has an Earnings ESP of +2.49% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nArista Networks’ shares have gained 12% year to date.

NVDA is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22.\r\n\r\nDocebo DCBO has an Earnings ESP of +8% and a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nDocebo’s shares have declined 3.9% year to date.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks You'll Wish You'd Bought on the Dip",
        "content": "After nearly a year during which artificial intelligence (AI) stocks steadily booked significant increases, the segment began to cool off in March. The pullbacks of some of these stocks left investors questioning whether the AI rally had run its course, or whether what was occurring was a healthy short-term correction.\n\nThe answer to that question likely depends somewhat on the individual company. Nonetheless, the recent sell-offs were likely a short-term correction for many of these stocks. And with that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool analysts for ideas on which AI stocks are now better positioned to deliver outsized returns for investors.\n\nNvidia's healthy breather is a long-term buying opportunity\n\nJustin Pope (Nvidia):Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is my pick for buying the dip. The stock has produced blistering gains over the past few years, but its acceleration to triple-digit percentage top- and bottom-line growth justified those gains. This uptick in Nvidia's business looks likely to last for some time. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNvidia is the dominant AI chip player today. The company's recipe for winning a large majority of that market has been a combination of cutting-edge chips and proprietary software that gets the most computing performance out of those chips. It's estimated that Nvidia now controls as much as 90% of the AI chip market.\n\nThe opportunity ahead of it is simple. AI is poised to become a massive market, and demand for computational capacity to support it could potentially lead to the data center footprint in America doubling by 2030, according to a report from Newmark. Even if competition eats into Nvidia's market share, Nvidia should benefit from the high demand that expansion will produce.\n\nOn average, analysts are forecasting that Nvidia's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 35% over the next three to five years. At today's share price, that outlook gives the stock a PEG ratio of just 1, which is a reasonable valuation.\n\nDon't let short-term price fluctuations distract you from the high probability that Nvidia will likely be a more valuable stock five or 10 years from now. Look at the bigger picture, and Nvidia's value will become apparent.\n\nMicrosoft's early investments in artificial intelligence are starting to pay off\n\nJake Lerch (Microsoft): My choice is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Thanks to its early forays into artificial intelligence, its competitive advantages are expanding. And after the stock's slight dip in recent weeks, the opportunity to buy into the world's largest company should not be overlooked.\n\nStory continues\n\nTake its position in the cloud computing market, for example. Microsoft Azure has long played second fiddle to Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, there are some indications this could be changing.\n\nFor one thing, Azure is growing faster than AWS. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Azure recorded 30% revenue growth while AWS grew by roughly 13%. Moreover, Microsoft has already integrated new AI tools into its offerings, including its Copilot suite, which includes many AI features for $30 a month. Amazon, on the other hand, has yet to meaningfully integrate AI features in AWS.\n\nUnlike some other AI stocks, Microsoft's stock price is not solely dependent on how that niche fares. While the growth of AI will be a significant factor in its results, Microsoft's diverse businesses, spanning from gaming to advertising, reduce its risk as an investment.\n\nFinally, the numbers don't lie. Microsoft is the world's largest company for a reason: Its management sets ambitious goals, and then achieves them. The company says it plans to grow its revenue to $500 billion by 2030 -- more than double its total over the last 12 months.\n\nThat's a bold target, but I have little doubt that CEO Satya Nadella can make it happen. After all, Microsoft's stock has returned an astounding 1,110% under his leadership. In short, Microsoft remains a great company -- one that investors should eagerly consider buying shares of on any dip.\n\nThis AI stock should again supercharge investor portfolios\n\nWill Healy(Tesla): The stock I would buy on the dip is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), as the negative sentiment around the stock has reached a fever pitch.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) company has lost close to half its value since last fall, and its market cap is down by more than 60% from its 2021 high. Slowing EV sales growth, a Cybertruck recall, and the uncertain future of Tesla's planned lower-cost vehicle have called into question many of the assumptions that once drove the stock higher.\n\nThe company's first-quarter results seemed to reflect the negative sentiment -- revenue fell 9% year-over-year to $21 billion. Additionally, operating expenses rose, resulting in quarterly net income falling by 55% to $1.1 billion.\n\nHowever, the saving grace for the company could be AI.\n\nTesla says it plans to unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8, and investors have good reason to take it seriously. The company recently released an updated version of its full self-driving software and reduced the monthly cost of that feature from $200 to $99. These improvements could stoke optimism about the coming robotaxi.\n\nMoreover, Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest have put a 2027 price target of $2,000 per share on the EV giant. That would be an approximate 12-fold gain from current levels.\n\nInvestors have good reason to take this call seriously. When Tesla was at a split-adjusted price of about $23 per share in 2018, Wood predicted it would rise to today's equivalent of $267 per share, a price it surpassed in 2021 before later pulling back.\n\nAdditionally, the stock staged a recovery on the news that it will begin production of a lower-cost vehicle in the second half of 2025. That increases the likelihood that Tesla has bottomed.\n\nIn the end, demand for lower-cost EVs and the larger number of potential customers for robotaxis could become long-term tailwinds for Tesla. That makes it more likely that another ambitious Ark Invest forecast for the stock will come true.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "How to Find Strong Computer and Technology Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.63 a share 22 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 22, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $5.63 Most Accurate Estimate and the $5.49 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nvidia has an Earnings ESP of 2.5%.\n\nNVDA is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Snap (SNAP) as well.\n\nSnap, which is readying to report earnings on July 23, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.03 a share, and SNAP is 84 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nSnap's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2350.02% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.\n\nNVDA and SNAP's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Here Are My 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution is in full swing, as evidence by the strong results reported by several big tech giants last week. There is perhaps no stronger medium-term tailwind than AI spending and investment; however, for investors putting money to work today, many AI-related stocks have soared this year, pricing in a very strong future.\n\nSo which are the best AI stocks to buy now? Perhaps those companies likely to benefit from the AI revolution, but which have either pulled back or trailed higher-profile peers based on near-term concerns.\n\nThat makes these three storied tech stocks prime pickups this week for your new AI investment dollars.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) plunged following its recent earnings report, but let's keep things in perspective. The stock had rallied some 50% at one point earlier this year, so it needed an absolutely perfect report to go higher.\n\nInstead, there were some legitimate concerns. Though Meta beat Q1 estimates, management guided somewhat conservatively, for \"only\" 18% growth in the coming quarter, a deceleration from last quarter's booming 27% growth. While revenue guidance came in a tad light, CEO Mark Zuckerberg actually increased his forecast for capital investments in artificial intelligence (AI) this year.\n\nLighter-than-expected revenue and increased spending is certainly a recipe for a sell-off. But that's probably shortsighted. After all, there's a good reason the company is ramping up AI investments this year. Not only are current AI investments benefiting Meta's core social media platform recommendation engines today, but Meta also has the potential to be an AI leader outside of its current core businesses. After all, its Llama 3 large language model has become a best-in-class LLM, especially in the open source community.\n\nMark Zuckerberg said on the conference call with analysts:\n\nSo with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. So that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data, and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf AI is really going to transform the world, Meta is one of only a handful of companies with the financial resources and talent to lead it. And it looks as though Zuckerberg isn't shying away from the opportunity.\n\nHe also has credibility here. Meta was doubted in being able to transition to mobile, then Stories, then Reels. But each time, Meta's investments paid off and the company was able to adapt to monetize the new opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta trades at only 22 times this year's estimates and about 19 times 2025 earnings estimates. Not only is that not a demanding valuation, but it also incorporates tens of billions in losses in the company's Reality Labs segment, which are running at a $15 billion loss rate. Meanwhile, investors don't seem to be counting on any payoff for that investment at all.\n\nBasically, the post-earnings dip is a great long-term opportunity for what could be the leading consumer AI company in the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhile Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) should benefit handsomely from the AI revolution, its stock only just getting back to its highs from 2021.\n\nBut could a breakout be in the cards? Amazon has been thought of as a laggard in the AI races, and its cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is currently growing at the slowest pace its competitors.\n\nBut those concerns may be overblown. After all, AWS is the largest cloud platform, so it's more difficult for it to grow at high rates compared with its smaller competitors. Moreover, Amazon has flexed its scale during the past downturn, in which customers asked to control costs, by lowering prices in exchange for longer-term commitments. And since Amazon is ahead of the game designing its own in-house processors called Graviton and its AI accelerators called Trainium and Inferentia, it's able to direct customer workloads to those lower-cost options when appropriate. Buy these undervalued AI stocks today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMoreover, Amazon offers perhaps the most diverse set of large language models from third parties in its Amazon Bedrock service, along with its own in-house LLM called Titan. And while Amazon missed out on investing in OpenAI, Amazon made a strategic $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic back in March. It's very early in the AI races, and it's quite possible OpenAI won't dominate the space even though it's the biggest private AI startup today.\n\nBedrock also continues to improve. Just last week, Amazon rolled out several new features. These include allowing businesses to create their own custom models and use that model from the same API as popular third-party models, a model evaluation and comparison tool that helps customers select the right model for their specific needs, and two new Titan models, one optimized for image generation and another optimized for question-and answer chatbots.\n\nFinally, generative AI has the potential to greatly advantage any business with lots of proprietary data. As the world's largest e-commerce retailer, Amazon will very likely utilize AI to improve its core e-commerce and advertising businesses, along with new scientific ventures like the Kuiper satellite broadband project. Amazon has a history of inventing new products and services that are difficult to build, so AI is likely to also greatly aid the company's innovation engine.\n\nIntel\n\nFor a higher-risk but much higher-reward pick in the AI space, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be an intriguing choice. Unlike other AI chip companies that have boomed, Intel's stock has badly lagged. Having fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) several years ago on process technology, which all of Intel's competitors use as their foundry, has really hurt its cause.\n\nBut CEO Pat Gelsinger has seemingly righted the ship, as Intel's \"five nodes in four years\" road map seems to be on track, with Intel hitting its innovation timelines over the past year-plus.\n\nOf course, the ambitious technology investment is taking a toll on Intel's bottom line, as it not only invests heavily in leading process technology for its own processors, but also builds out capabilities for third-party chipmakers to use its foundry.\n\nAll of the uncertainty on execution and the multiyear plan has caused investors to flee to the sidelines for now. That's especially true as Intel's core market, the PC market, seems to be recovering slowly from its post-pandemic downturn. But that's why Intel stock today can be bought at just 1.3 times book value.\n\nYet if Intel executes, there's a chance it could make big inroads into the AI chip market. Management now forecasts over $500 million of revenue from its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator in the second half of this year, which Intel claims outdoes even Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 on certain workloads. Even better, Intel believes that 2025 will see it catch up to rivals on process technology in CPUs, when it releases the Xeon processor Clearwater Forest. Gelsinger believes that chip may be able to handle some key AI inferencing tasks that may be more cost-effective for CPUs to do than GPU accelerators. And 2025 should also see Intel's introduction of \"Falcon Shores,\" which actually combines Gaudi and Xeon technology into an AI superchip with the potential to rival Nvidia's Grace-Hopper or Grace-Blackwell superchips.\n\nWill Intel really overtake Nvidia in AI computing anytime soon? Probably not. But at its market cap at a just $135 billion versus Nvidia's market cap of $2.2 trillion, Intel only has to make some mild share inroads in AI for the stock to work.\n\nWhile an investment in Intel is riskier than other AI players, as it's highly execution-dependent, it also has much higher potential rewards, should the Gelsinger turnaround plan work out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the latest stocks Jim Cramer is recommending. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nJim Cramer is concluding April by talking about some specific stocks whose performance could give investors insights into the market dynamics today. On Monday, Cramer said during his program on CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s recent rise is \"instructive of what can make a stock go higher in this dynamic market.\"\n\nElon Musk Bags a \"Terrific Rabbit\"\n\nCramer said he's been saying that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares would keep tanking until and unless \"Elon Musk pull a rabbit out of the hat.\" Cramer said while Musk wasn’t able to find \"that rabbit\" in time for the quarter, he was able to \"bag a terrific one\" on the weekend as the company received in-principle approval from China to deploy its driver-assistance system. The stock jumped about 15% on the news. This development, according to Cramer, could give Elon Musk a \"whole new revenue stream\" and offset the effects of \"vicious\" price cuts in China.\n\nCramer also talked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s latest deal with Baidu, which he called the \"Google of China.\" The deal, according to media reports, is related to Baidu's mapping and navigation functions, and could clear a hurdle for Tesla to start operating its autonomous driving technology in China.\n\nJim Cramer said that Elon Musk is \"doing something no American CEO can do, just get on a plane and make a deal with the leader of a country\" that our government is not fond of. Because of this, according to Cramer, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders are loving Elon Musk since the stock is up significantly, making a \"fool of last week's downgraders.\"\n\nCramer said that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares can \"keep running\" until its \"shorts are crushed.\"\n\nShould You \"Buy The Fear\" on Apple? Cramer Shares His Thoughts\n\nJim Cramer also talked about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is up after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi upgraded it, urging investors to \"buy the fear,\" with an $195 price target. Cramer highlighted Sacconaghi's thesis which says that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be entering a \"seasonably strong trading period.\" The analyst also said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s problems in China might be \"cyclical\" and the stock is a buy because of its low valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut does Cramer agree with Toni Sacconaghi? Cramer reiterated that for the past 20 years he's believed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock should be held, not traded. He also said that Toni Sacconaghi is an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"skeptic\" as in February 2018 the analyst downgraded the stock and cut his price target to $170. Adjusting for Apple's stock split, the analyst's projections turned out to be wrong. Cramer said that Toni Sacconaghi is a \"leader\" of the \"contingent\" which has been saying that Apple's \"glory days\" are behind us. Cramer also said he doesn’t care about Toni Sacconaghi's estimates and projections and feels the analyst's bullish call on the stock might \"jinx it.\" However, Jim Cramer yet again recommended investors to buy the stock, albeit after a pullback.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on and recommends investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer said he was \"waiting\" for someone to bring Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) stock up. Cramer is bullish on the company because of its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer said Nvidia talked about Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) \"endlessly\" at the \"great\" GTC conference.\n\n\"I think you have a real winner. The stock went up around the conference and it has come right back down. Recursion is for me.\"\n\nRXRX is a small company which Cramer likes. He is also recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the long term.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings call, Recursion talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"Then in July, a month later, we announced our collaboration with NVIDIA.\n\nThis included a $50 million equity investment. And with our partners at NVIDIA, we’re working on advanced computation, so foundation model development; we’ve got priority access to compute hardware, which I’ll talk about later; and the DGXCloud Resources and we talked with them about the potential for us to put some of our tools into their BioNeMo marketplace. And in fact, just last month in January at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we released the first third-party tool to exist on NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform. That was our Phenom-Beta foundation model in January of 2024. So very excited about this ongoing collaboration. One month later in August, we were able to deliver a demonstration of how we leveraged the May acquisition of Cyclica and our brand new partnership with NVIDIA to drive a real value into our platform.\n\nWe were able to predict the protein ligand interactions for more than 36 billion compounds from the N Enamine REAL Space across about 80,000 predicted binding pockets spanning the human proteome. And what this did was generate a large in silico data layer for us, a synthetic data layer.\"\n\nRead the detailed earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about oil and gas pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD). He said that the company has the \"best network\" of fractionators in America. He hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD).\n\n\"I can't say enough positive things,\" Cramer said.\n\n8. Caseys General Stores Inc (NASDAQ:CASY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program called food and grocery company Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) a \"gem\" and hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on the stock.\n\n\"Loved the pizza there.. that is a winner, it should be bought, it's not that expensive given its growth prospects. I wish they'd split the stock.\"\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Strategy’s consumer staples holdings also fared well. One of our top performers was Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY), which operates convenience stores and gas stations. The company continues to drive greater growth and improve internal performance through the expansion of its private label offerings, while a cooling labor market has helped alleviate wage pressures on margins. By deliberately focusing its geographic footprint on smaller communities, the company has high market share in the regions it serves as well as pricing power, which we believe will continue to be long-term earnings drivers.”\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nWhen asked about energy drinks company Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), Jim Cramer said that he's \"liking\" Celsius. Cramer said Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) went down \"because of Monster, but the problems with Monster are really the win for Celsius.\"\n\nJim Cramer was referring the Monster Beverage's declines that came after the stock was hit by two downgrades from notable Wall Street analysts. JPMorgan decreased its rating for the stock to Neutral from Overweight, while Truist Securities downgraded the stock to Sell.\n\nLike CELH, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius’ product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.”\n\n6. Coterra Energy Inc (NYSE:CTRA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nAnswering a question about oilfield services company Schlumberger, Cramer said that the company \"did not deliver.\" Cramer said he feels \"terrible\" about the stock. However, Cramer reminded investors that he likes Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) and his charitable trust also owns a position in the company.\n\nCoterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) stock has gained about 10% so far this year.\n\nLike Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cramer is also bullish on CTRA.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other bottom contributors in Q4 included Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), VF Corporation and Ciena Corporation. Coterra Energy is an oil exploration and production company focused in West Texas’s Permian Basin and Oklahoma. Though production is beating expectations, shares traded in sympathy with the broader industry, which declined alongside falling oil and natural gas prices.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "AI stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) dominate the market with top-of-the-line chips that power the newest, most exciting AI software like ChatGPT. However, these stocks sit at a relatively high valuation, given the attention they have gathered from investors with recent performances.\n\nWhile there is certainly something to be said about their continued growth and ownership of shares, cheaper AI stocks are brimming with potential and a more solid runway supporting them in the coming years. These three AI stocks have excellent growth potential and are valued exceptionally well for investors looking to gain some considerable returns.\n\nLet’s learn more about these companies’ stakes in AI and how they are set up comfortably to grow and prosper in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a globally recognized processor company that has spent many years at the top of its market segment. The company recently showed it is not afraid to take leaps to stay ahead in today’s market. Primarily, Intel demonstrated its commitment to sticking with the times by launching its Gaudi 2 AI accelerator chips.\n\nAlthough the Gaudi 2 chips are somewhat below the high-spec standards set by competitors’ products, such as Nvidia’s B200 Blackwell chip, the company is not out of the race. Intel recently announced a comparison between its new Gaudi 3 chips and Nvidia’s H100, and the results are shocking.\n\nThe Gaudi 3 is reported to show 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency. In addition to these impressive statistics, Intel has had much better per-dollar performance in its chips. Intel’s products are more affordable than its competitors, opening it up to a broader market.\n\nThe company’s investments in bettering its chips and an already solid processing business give it an excellent foundation. Its first-quarter report included some mediocre results, causing a dip in its valuation. However, there is no denying Intel will become a major player and has excellent means for a considerable jump soon.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the best-performing stocks ever. Its momentum has been astonishing and continues to surge, reporting a 14% year-over-year (YoY) increase in net sales and an over $10 billion increase in operating income last quarter.\n\nWhile Amazon is not cheap, it is not valued as high as other AI stocks like Nvidia. The price becomes even more reasonable considering Amazon’s continued growth and expanding market share. Amazon is using its money to make heavy investments in the technology of the future, AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, Amazon has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading competitor of ChatGPT in generative AI. Amazon has also released its own AI service, Bedrock, a tool to assist developers in creating and shaping future generative AI applications.\n\nBedrock is part of Amazon’s cloud computing software, AWS, and further AI enhancements and additions will only improve its value to Amazon’s revenue streams. AWS brought in $24.2 billion last quarter, representing an increase of 13% YoY.\n\nAmazon is one of the companies with a very secure padding for continued investing in AI and will undoubtedly be an industry leader in the coming years.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) offers the latest and greatest technology in design software. The company’s unique selling point is its superior generative AI tools, which specialize in extremely high-quality 3D AI images.\n\nThe company’s CEO claims Autodesk’s tools are ten times faster and have much better quality than any other 3D image-generative AI. ADSK is also working on a shared platform that utilizes AI for designers at any point in the design process and allows seamless flow through operations and processes.\n\nAutodesk is still a relatively young company and has not finished its period of growing pains. Although the company reported an 11% revenue increase year-over-year last quarter, its margin has remained flat, and cash has slightly dipped.\n\nDespite the current fluctuations and ripples in Autodesk’s financials, the company is brimming with growth potential. It is in a great position to be at the forefront of generative AI design for years to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Warning: Don’t Get Caught Holding These 3 Semiconductor Stocks",
        "content": "U.S. equities posted some gains last week, which I’m sure was refreshing to see given the sell-off a week prior. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. This brings their respective year-to-date gains up to 6.9% and 4.0%. Unfortunately, market risks still remain. Not only do we still need inflation to come down consistently, but some U.S. equities, like semiconductor stocks, are still technically trading at relatively expensive multiples, and may be stocks to avoid, for now at least.\n\nIn terms of semiconductor stocks, some may see a bright spot in the market. I would press for caution. Even though, TSMC (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid Q1, we must keep in mind, the contract chip manufacturer’s upbeat earnings and guidance are entangled with the blooming artificial intelligence chip market. Not every semiconductor company is poised to benefit from AI, as they have their own manufacturing issues or have products embedded within other end-markets. Below are three semiconductor stocks to avoid as the potential for a market crash remains in our midst.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) slump is a real phenomenon. Although, it’s not affecting every electric vehicle manufacturer in the same manner. A slew of Chinese EV makers, as an example, have posted better than expected first quarter results. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), on the other hand, has continued to disappoint. However, the slowdown in the EV market does not just impact cars manufacturers. Since so many semiconductor products help power so many of today’s newer vehicles, investors would do well to avoid semiconductor companies with a large EV end-market. This includes a chip firm called Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe semiconductor firm uses gallium nitride and silicon carbide to create materials that eventually become inputs products for EVs, fast charging and wireless technologies. In their Q2’2024 earnings report, revenues increased year-over-year and beat Wall Street estimates, but Wolfspeed’s net loss expanded due to “underutilization costs” related to a new production facility its building. While in the long-term added production will likely be a value-add, the short-terms whims of the market might not regard the further loss in net income so optimistically.\n\nWOLF shares have fallen nearly 40% on a year-to-date perspective. EV demand will probably remain lackluster until rates come down sufficiently, so even the medium-term headwinds for Wolfspeed’s business may be in jeopardy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has given shareholders mixed share price performance in recent years. Last year was, broadly, a great year for semiconductor stocks, especially those that traded at low valuations. Intel’s share price nearly doubled in 2023. There was a lot of AI hype driving shares higher as market-watchers and traders speculated what the legacy chip maker would be able to bring to the new space.\n\nUnfortunately, for Intel, in 2024, the stock has gone back to being a disappointment. INTC has plummeted over 30% year-to-date. Weak guidance following Intel’s Q1 earnings report put a lot of pressure on shares. The chip maker’s earning report as a whole was mostly positive, although there was clearly slack in both its Foundry and Data Center and AI businesses, which are both facing enormous competitive risks.\n\nFor these reasons, Bank of America and Goldman Sachsdecided to significantly lower their price targets. Goldman Sachs also reiterated its “Sell” rating.\n\nWhile these competitive disadvantages exist, Intel is probably not the stock to hold, particularly as risks of a market crash mount.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), although a legacy chipmaker, deserves its entry on my list of semiconductor stocks to avoid. The semiconductor firm just has not been able to properly diversify into high growth end-markets that would earn it a spot in anyone’s portfolios. Texas Instruments deal in two business segments: Analog and Embedded devices. The former happens to be the larger segment of the two and deals with devices that help manage power in a variety of electronic devices. Continued soft demand in this end market led to TXN posting a 16% decline in revenue for their Q1 2024 earnings print.\n\nThe electronics sectors are still rebounding from last year’s chip glut. Chip firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and TSMC are not increasing revenue and profits based on a revitalized sector; rather, they’re tapping into new sectors of growth, namely AI. Without diversification into higher growth end-markets, it’s quite likely Texas Instruments will continue to deliver lukewarm growth and profits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "3 Autonomous Driving Stocks with the Potential to Make You an Overnight Millionaire",
        "content": "Self-driving cars are hitting the roads, creating a big opportunity for autonomous driving stocks.\n\nMercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGYY) just became the first automaker to sell Level 3 autonomous cars in the U.S. And it doesn’t need a driver to watch the road.\n\nLevel 3 refers to different stages of driving automation. Levels 0, 1 and 2 refer to driver support features, which can steer, accelerate and brake. However, a driver must constantly supervise and take over when needed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWithLevels 3, 4 and 5, a driver is not driving when automated driving features are on. That’s even if you are in the driver’s seat. With Level 3, though, when requested by the features, you have to take control of the car. With Levels 4 and 5, automated driving features will not require you to take over, as noted by SAE International.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn’t at a Level 3 is because, according to The Verge, its self-driving cars have been linked to hundreds of crashes and deaths. As noted by CNBC, “Tesla’s Autopilot design has ‘led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,’ the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”\n\nMeanwhile, it was just reported that a self-driving Waymo taxi was seen driving down the wrong side of the road.\n\nWhile Waymo and Tesla still have a lot of work to do, Mercedes-Benz seems to be off to a good start, which could help fuel upside potential for other autonomous driving stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the tech sector is a big part of the autonomous driving boom.\n\nAccording to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CFO Collette Kress, “nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with Nvidia,” as quoted by QZ.com.\n\nNvidia is also working with hundreds of auto companies, including carmakers, truck makers and robotaxis. That includes Mercedes, Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF). Even Tesla was a big client in 2023, buying H100 GPUs.\n\nGranted, NVDA is an $877 stock at the moment but it’s still a bargain. Some analysts say it could fly well above $1,000 near term. Loop Capital, for example, says NVDA could test $1,200, noting that company earnings will significantly beat estimates this year. The firm also has a buy rating on the stock. Even Oppenheimer analysts raised their price target to $850, citing growth from its data center revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvery pullback in NVDA is a buying opportunity.\n\nAmbarella (AMBA) Autonomous Driving Stocks, A finger hovering over an \"autonomous drive\" button.\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at beaten-down, oversold shares of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), another one of the top autonomous driving stocks.\n\nAfter dropping on earnings, the stock is now oversold and is attempting to pivot higher. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Better, if you look at a two-year chart of AMBA, you’ll see that each time those three indicators align in oversold territory. And just as they’re doing now, the stock tends to bounce back. It’s happened about eight times since 2022.\n\nWith negativity now priced into AMBA stock, I’d like to see it retest $65 again near term. Helping, the company just announced a strategic deal focused on advanced mobility systems.\n\nAs noted in a recent press release, SANY Group “agreed to leverage Ambarella’s powerful CV3-AD family of automotive AI domain controller systems-on-chip (SoCs) to develop advanced automated driving solutions, and to achieve technical validation and deployment on its next-gen commercial vehicles and special-purpose vehicles.”\n\nKodiak Robotics also noted that itsnext-generation self-driving truck platform will use Ambarella’s CV3-AD685 SoC to “provide a high-performance compute solution in the smallest form factor, which enables Kodiak’s modular autonomous vehicle platform hardware across a wide variety of environmental conditions,” as noted in an AMBA press release.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) A young woman reads a book while behind the wheel of a self-driving car.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want greater exposure autonomous and electric vehicle (EV) stocks at less cost, look at the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to name a few.\n\nAt less than $24 a share, the DRIV ETF has been trending higher since bottoming out at around $23 a share. From its current price of $23.27, I’d like to see it retest $27.50 near term. What’s nice about the ETF is that I can buy 100 shares of it for about $2,327. Meanwhile, if I were to buy 100 shares of just one of its holdings, such as TSLA, it would cost me close to $16,830.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (If You Dare)",
        "content": "From the working class anticipating joblessness to the financial analysts predicting a market takeover by artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, the algorithmic revolution has been historic. AI tech has seen such explosive growth that some financial analysts might tell you that you are already too late to benefit from investing in AI stocks.\n\nDon’t panic though, the views regarding AI’s application and usefulness are still polarized, and many technology companies have very recently jumped into this new space. So, if you are someone who believes sometimes riskier investments can do wonders in terms of making significant wealth, then here are the three AI stocks that could make you a fortune.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational company specializing in manufacturing and selling of consumer technology products. As of April 2024, Apple is the second-largest company in the world according to its market cap valuation of $2.61 rillion. The stock price has experienced a downward spiral in the past year. However, Yahoo Finance analysts have an average one-year price target of around $199, which is 17.62% higher than the current trading value of $169.30.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere is no denying that Apple’s past year has not been great in terms of its performance in the market, primarily owing to the decreasing demand for iPhones. However, Apple’s backfooting in the AI realm has kept investors confused. But that’s over now as Apple finally sets to unveil its artificial intelligence system named ReALM, which is said to be more powerful than the OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nThe stock lost around 15% of its value in the past four months, but the company anticipates a strong recovery with the launch of its language processing model along with the release of the new iOS 18. On the brighter side, the stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which makes the stock further stand out ahead of a potential AI-tech drop.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA (NVDA) logo on wall\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the largest chip and graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer in the world. The chipmaker really surprised the industry by showing off a massive 223% stock price growth within the past year. However, the more surprising fact is the current price sits closer to the lower valuation of $478.40 as compared to the highest valuation of $2,762. This means there is likely ample room upwards.\n\nBeing the backbone of any hardcore computer processing power, the manufacturer has quite strategically positioned itself where a lot of AI propagation is dependent on its hardware and software components. Moreover, the recent acquisition of Israel-based Run:ai places the chipmaker at the forefront of the artificial intelligence race.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if the future of the company is not certain in the AI realm itself, the company has earned analysts’ trust. For the past two months, the stock has been among the strongest buying recommendations. Rightly so, with the stock trading at only 36x forward earnings, and a massive growth estimate of over 450%. Thus, it puts this AI stock among investor favorites.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and chip manufacturer founded back in 1961. It is one of those companies that only a few investors knew about but recently caught attention as the company aims to outshine its largest rival in the ongoing AI revolution. As of now, the average price target sits at $1,522, which is already over 13% higher than the current valuation of $1344.\n\nBroadcom is quite a reputable company when it comes to the manufacturing of mobile phone chipsets. AI scalability and further expansion are highly dependent on the efficiency of the hardware, and that’s where Broadcom is establishing its footing. With the mantra “Open, Scalable, Power Efficient”, the chipmaker is focused on enabling consumer AI.\n\nDue to growing demand for AI, the silicon merchant estimates 35% of total revenue, or $10 billion, comes from AI products. The chipmaker enjoyed massive share price growth of 135% in the past year with earnings per share growing over 25%. The stock trades at just 28x forward earnings. Given its huge successes, AVGO stock should be a hot pick for investors wanting exposure in the AI realm.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Underappreciated AI Stocks Flying Under the Radar (but Not for Long)",
        "content": "There’s no question that artificial intelligence dominates current headlines but the escalating valuations of this ecosystem also raise curiosity for underappreciated AI stocks. You might be wondering, are there still hidden gems in this heavily hyped space?\n\nThe answer in my opinion is yes (not a surprise there because this article would be pointless otherwise). Not only that, you don’t necessarily have to speculate with wildly risky ideas (although you can choose to do so). Instead, many options exist depending on your comfort level.\n\nBelow are three underappreciated AI stocks to put on your radar.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen discussions about digital intelligence sprout up, the usual suspects like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) come to mind. However, investors may want to consider Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). As a major player in the wireless communications segment – and by logical deduction the 5G rollout – QCOM offers a solid idea for underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nFundamentally, one of biggest AI-related catalysts for Qualcomm centers on edge computing. This functionality involves processing data locally on devices instead of strictly depending on cloud-based servers. Subsequently, QCOM stock is up over 18% year-to-date. No, it’s not the most brilliant performance among tech players but those who know, know.\n\nInvestors for the most part enjoy Qualcomm’s consistency of performance. Last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.28%. For the current year, experts are anticipating earnings per share of $9.78, a big improvement over last year’s $8.43. On the revenue front, they’re looking for $38.18 billion, up 6.6% from last year’s haul of $35.83 billion.\n\nCombined with a forward annual dividend yield of 2.05%, it’s worth a look.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nAlthough the tech segment seems to be all about digital intelligence, not every player has benefited from the surge. Just take a look at Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). In other circumstances, I believe that BIDU would be seen as a solid contender. However, its home market of China has encountered significant economic challenges during the post-pandemic cycle. So, skepticism reigns.\n\nIn addition, BIDU just hasn’t been delivering the goods. Since the start of the year, BIDU stock slipped almost 13%. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s down 17%. However, for contrarians, the red ink could present an opportunity for underappreciated AI stocks to buy. Notably, management stated during its fourth-quarter earnings disclosure that it’s been benefiting from AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, here’s the thing. BIDU stock is already undervalued, trading at 9.95X forward earnings. Compare that to the sector median of 17.21X. Granted, in fiscal 2024, analysts see a slowdown in the bottom line. However, the high-side target calls for EPS of $12.30, above last year’s print of $11.41. It could be a gamble worth taking.\n\nAeva Technologies (AEVA) Mobile phone with logo of American autonomous driving company Aeva Inc. on screen in front of business web page. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s super risky but if you want to target underappreciated AI stocks with supreme upside potential, take a look at Aeva Technologies (NYSE:AEVA). Per its corporate profile, Aeva is involved in the development of lidar sensing systems and related perception technologies. These initiatives focus on building an autonomous future for our roadways. In particular, Aeva specializes in what it terms 4D lidar.\n\nWith its 4D tech, Aeva goes beyond software that merely recognizes surrounding objects. Rather, the system can calculate anticipated trajectories, thus leading to proactive accident avoidance rather than merely reactive. It may seem like a subtle difference but it’s actually a massive one. Therefore, Aeve commands game-changing potential.\n\nNow, getting the market to recognize this dynamic has been a challenge. However, analysts see big things ahead. For fiscal 2024, they’re targeting revenue of $8.79 million, up 103.8% from last year’s tally of $4.31 million. And fiscal 2025 could see sales shoot up to over $37 million.\n\nIf you have the patience for volatility, AEVA could be one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) remains a hot topic, with investors’ minds focused on which AI stocks to buy. Despite the volatility risks inherent to the technology sector and recent market declines, investors are still scrutinizing which AI stocks to buy as the field shows growth potential. Although many investors have profited from buying AI stocks, analysts’ perspectives on AI vary.\r\n\r\nFor those pondering the right AI stocks to buy, the question remains whether this is the time to participate in the ongoing evolution. Estimated to span another decade, some debate AI is a bubble ultimately bursting while others argue the bubble keeps going for several years, supporting AI stocks through 2026.\r\n\r\nIndustry leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved phenomenal performance in recent years. However, their soaring market caps signify they may have reached their peak growth potential. This suggests that investors seeking the next big AI stocks to buy may search for lesser-known AI companies that could prove higher-reward opportunities.\n\n​Soundhound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) remains one of the AI stocks to buy despite being a small company in the AI space. It has significant growth potential thanks to its innovative applications. The company provides text-to-speech and speech recognition through AI for real-time translation and applications. It is used for applications such as taking restaurant orders and integrating voice into vehicles. However, it also has potential applications in broader retail spaces as companies look to integrate AI and natural language understanding. One of the key areas the company could break into is healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe company deserves a place as one of the AI stocks to buy. Last year, it boosted sales by 80% over the and halved its net loss. While sales were just $17.1 million in the most recent quarter, SOUN registered over $600 million in order backlog. Having soared over 100% this year and trading approximately 50% below its peak of $10.25, SOUN makes a reasonable candidate as one of the AI stocks to buy. Analysts expect the share price to accelerate at least another 45% from current levels to $7.15 per share on average.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Palantir attracts significant attention in AI cybersecurity, SentinelOne (NYSE:S) could be an overlooked opportunity worth considering as one of the millionaire-potential AI stocks to buy. The AI cybersecurity market is projected to experience an annual growth of 9.4%, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2028. With a market capitalization of $6 billion, SentinelOne has extremely powerful potential for expansion within the high-growth AI cybersecurity industry.\r\n\r\nIn its last quarter, SentinelOne’s revenue increased 38% year-over-year (YOY). However, it missed revenue retention and estimates, and revenue guidance. Despite expecting similar revenue growth this quarter, investors punished the AI stock following the earnings report. It trades over 15% lower year-to-date (YTD) near $21 per share. Notably, S changed hands as high as $76.30 per share in 2021, offering a substantial 3x growth from current levels. Growth estimates for next year stand at 1200%, whereas the S&P500 is expected to rise 13.10%. The company has also beaten earnings estimates for four quarters straight with double-digit surprises.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n​Upstart (UPST) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc. (UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final pick of the AI stocks to buy is Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST), a financial technology company that uses AI and Machine Learning (ML) to help consumers access affordable credit. The company’s AI-enabled platform assists lenders in making real-time credit decisions, providing a better risk assessment than traditional credit bureaus Equifax (NYSE:EFX) and TransUnion (NYSE:TRU). Due to its advanced risk modeling capabilities, Upstart’s partners experience 53% fewer loan defaults at comparable approval rates.\n\nWith over 80% of Americans relying on credit scores, Upstart addresses a massive market opportunity for expanding access to affordable loans. While higher interest rates have recently slowed loan volumes, Upstart is well positioned for growth as the Federal Reserve is expected to start lowering rates in the coming years. As such, its platform is poised to facilitate more loans and deliver strong returns for shareholders as borrowing costs decrease. Although it barely grew in 2024, up 2.75%, it traded as high as $400 per share during the last accommodative periods of 2021, offering a staggering 17x growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 30, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE and Marriott International, Inc. MAR.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Alphabet and Amazon.com\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc. and Marriott International, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Ultra-High-Yield Dividend Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet roughly 30 years ago, there hasn't been an innovation or trend that's excited professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe lure of AI is the ability of software and systems to learn over time without human intervention (what's known as \"machine learning\"). Having these systems become more proficient at their assigned tasks, as well as expanding their utility beyond their initial assignment(s), gives AI a use case in virtually all sectors and industries.\n\nWall Street's brightest minds and most successful investors aren't oblivious to the game-changing growth potential AI brings to the table. It's why semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has gained close to $1.9 trillion in market cap since 2023 began.\n\nBut not all of Wall Street's top-tier investors see this AI darling maintaining its elite status. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nProminent billionaires have been decisive sellers of Nvidia stock\n\nNvidia has arguably benefited from the AI revolution more than any other company. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the clear choice of businesses running AI-accelerated data centers. Various estimates from Wall Street analysts peg Nvidia's share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers at roughly 90% in 2024!\n\nAdditionally, exceptional demand for Nvidia's chips -- especially its H100 GPUs that power large language models and generative AI solutions -- helped the company more than triple its Data Center segment sales last year. With demand handily outpacing the supply of its high-powered GPUs, Nvidia's margins, sales, and profits have all soared.\n\nDespite these positives, eight prominent billionaire investors pared down their fund's respective stakes in Nvidia during the December-ended quarter. The three biggest sellers included (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)\n\nHistory provides a key reason for these highly successful billionaires to be skeptical of Nvidia. There hasn't been a single innovation or next-big-thing trend over the last three decades that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event during its early stages of expansion. It's commonplace for investors to overestimate the adoption of a new technology. More than likely, this'll be the fate of AI in the not-too-distant future as well.\n\nNvidia is also set to face a lot of internal competition. While most AI enthusiasts are focused on external competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, the bigger concern is that Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (approximately 40% of Nvidia's revenue) are all developing AI GPUs of their own. If they're developing their own hardware, there's a good chance we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, regulators have given billionaires little reason to believe Nvidia's stock can head higher. U.S. regulators have, on two separate occasions, restricted exports of the company's high-powered GPUs to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. These export limitations are likely costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nWhile these three prominent billionaires were busy selling shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, they were piling into two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks instead. \"Ultra-high-yield\" refers to any stock with a yield that's at least four times higher than the current yield of the S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUltra-high-yield dividend stock No. 1 billionaires are buying: AT&T (6.63% yield)\n\nThe first supercharged dividend stock that billionaires were aggressively buying as they were simultaneously sending Nvidia to the chopping block is telecom titan AT&T(NYSE: T). During the December-ended quarter, Israel Englander of Millennium Management added 19,054,972 shares of AT&T, while Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management purchased 4,970,954 shares.\n\nThe biggest challenge for telecom stocks, and the reason they performed so poorly last year, relates to a report from the Wall Street Journal issued in July 2023. The WSJ alleges legacy telecom companies could face exorbitant cleanup costs and health-related liabilities tied to their use of lead-sheathed cables in their networks. Wall Street loathes uncertainty and the possibility of legal overhangs.\n\nThe good news for AT&T and its peers is that any possible costs tied to these allegations are years away. AT&T has refuted claims that its lead-clad cables are a health hazard. Further, any liability claims would probably be dealt with in the notoriously slow U.S. court system. Englander and Cohen likely realize the WSJ story is much ado about nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, the bread and butter of AT&T's operations continue to improve in virtually all aspects. Upgrading its network to support 5G speeds is modestly increasing wireless revenue, keeping churn rates near historic lows, and fueling data consumption, which is the key margin driver of its wireless segment.\n\nAdditionally, AT&T's broadband segment has produced rock-solid gains as investments in 5G have picked up. The first quarter of 2024 saw the company add 252,000 net AT&T Fiber subscribers, which puts it on track to add more than 1 million net broadband subscribers for a seventh consecutive year. Continually adding broadband subscribers is a recipe that should encourage high-margin service bundling.\n\nLastly, billionaires might be enticed by the presumably safe floor and reasonable upside that accompanies AT&T stock. Shares are currently valued at roughly 7 times Wall Street's consensus forward-year earnings. Given that wireless access and broadband service have evolved into necessities, there's not much perceived downside risk in AT&T's stock at this level.\n\nUltra-high-yield dividend stock No. 2 billionaires are buying: Pfizer (6.61% yield)\n\nThe second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that billionaires were buying as they were dumping shares of Nvidia during the first quarter is none other than pharmaceutical giant Pfizer(NYSE: PFE). Two of the most illustrious buyers of Pfizer stock were Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (10,947,182 shares purchased) and Israel Englander of Millennium Management (5,282,369 shares purchased).\n\nThe best way to describe why Pfizer stock recently hit multiyear lows is that it's been a victim of its own success. It's one of the few drug companies that successfully developed a COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral treatment (Paxlovid) during the pandemic. While sales of these two therapies soared to more than $56 billion in 2022, they're collectively only expected to bring in $8 billion in revenue in 2024. A greater-than $48 billion sales drop-off in two years has deflated expectations and near-term hope for Pfizer stock.\n\nOn the other hand, Comirnaty and Paxlovid have given Pfizer an $8 billion boost compared to what the company had in total drug sales at the start of the decade. Further, its non-COVID therapies grew sales by 7% in 2023 and are forecast to increase revenue by 3% to 5% in 2024. In simple terms, Pfizer's drug portfolio is in far better shape now than it was a few years ago.\n\nPfizer's current and prospective shareholders are likely also excited about its integration of cancer-drug developer Seagen, which it acquired in a $43 billion deal in December. Although acquisition-related costs will weigh on Pfizer's earnings per share (EPS) this year to the tune of ($0.40) per share, the combination of these two businesses will result in meaningful cost savings, a broadening of Pfizer's cancer-drug pipeline, and tangible EPS expansion in the years to come.\n\nSomething that often gets taken for granted when investing in healthcare stocks is that they're highly defensive. Given that stocks are historically pricey right now, buying shares of a company whose products will be in steady demand regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing should lead to predictable cash flow for Pfizer and a reasonably safe floor for its shares.\n\nFinally, like AT&T, Pfizer's valuation makes a lot of sense and offers a favorable risk-versus-reward profile. Pfizer stock is currently valued at roughly 9 times Wall Street's consensus EPS for 2025. This represents a 15% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Pay a Dividend. In Mere Hours, a New Member May Join the Club",
        "content": "Following a volatile start to the decade, the bulls are, once again, running wild on Wall Street. Despite a modest pullback, investors have witnessed the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite jump to record-closing highs within the last five weeks.\n\nWhile there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors since this new bull market took shape, the Magnificent Seven have done the lion's share of the heavy lifting. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are long-term outperformers with well-defined competitive advantages\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of Wall Street's largest and most-influential businesses. Listed in descending order by market cap, as of the closing bell on April 26, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nAside from all seven of these companies crushing the S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, their lure, from an investment standpoint, is their competitive advantages and/or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging the old with the new. Windows is still the world's leading operating system for desktops, while Azure is the global No. 2 cloud-infrastructure service platform. Apple's calling card to success has long been its iPhone, which accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to make up in the neighborhood of 90% of the GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet's Google comprised more than 91% of global internet-search share in March, while streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world. Amazon's online marketplace is No. 1 in the U.S., with an estimated 37.6% of domestic online retail share in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud-infrastructure service platform. Meta Platforms owns the top social media sites globally, including Facebook, which attract more than 3.2 billion daily active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nBut there's a new draw to the Magnificent Seven that didn't exist when 2024 began: Most of these companies now pay a dividend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay a regular dividend to their shareholders\n\nWhen most investors think of the Magnificent Seven, they probably envision Wall Street's steadiest growth stocks. With these businesses aggressively reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth segments and innovations, collecting dividend income is likely an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, operating cash flow has been so robust for most of these companies that paying a regular dividend can be done without hampering their innovative capacity in any way.\n\nEntering 2024, three Magnificent Seven constituents had been paying a dividend to their shareholders for years.\n\nMicrosoft has been paying a continuous quarterly dividend since September 2004 and has seen its payout grow by more than 800% since its dividend program was first initiated. Apple reinstated its quarterly-dividend program in the summer of 2012 and has increased its payout by 154% in under 12 years. Nvidia has paid what currently amounts to a token dividend ($0.04 per quarter) dating back to the summer of 2013.\n\nIn February, Meta Platforms joined the party when its board introduced a $0.50 per-quarter distribution. Even with aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality devices, and the metaverse, Meta closed out the March quarter with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated over $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations during the quarter. It has the balance sheet and capital to support a continuous payout to its shareholders.\n\nLast week, Alphabet became the newest member of the club. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and now-profitable cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, initiated a $0.20 per-quarter dividend. Alphabet ended March with over $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated an astounding $28.8 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of the new year. It can easily absorb this annual payout while fueling its cloud and AI-driven ambitions.\n\nLater today, Tuesday, April 30, a sixth member of the Magnificent Seven has an opportunity to join the club.\n\nIs this the newest dividend-paying Magnificent Seven stock?\n\nLast week, Tesla's operating results made it plainly evident that it won't be doling out a dividend anytime soon to its shareholders. Tesla endured a free-cash outflow of $2.53 billion during the first quarter, with EV competition heating up and multiple rounds of price cuts wrecking the company's operating margin. Selling a commoditized product in a cyclical industry might make it difficult for Tesla to ever pay a dividend.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven component that could become the newest dividend paying stock in mere hours is Amazon -- the company is slated to report its first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today.\n\nWith Amazon stock trading at a multiple of 62 times trailing-12-month earnings, you might be quick to dismiss the likelihood of the company doling out a dividend to its shareholders. However, Amazon's balance sheet, and its three ancillary operating segments that are bona fide cash machines, suggest it can become the next income stock.\n\nWhen the curtain closed on 2023, Amazon was sitting on a treasure chest of nearly $86.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. More importantly, net cash provided by operating activities soared to nearly $85 billion in 2023 from $46.8 billion in the previous year. By 2027, Amazon's three higher-margin ancillary segments -- AWS, advertising services, and subscription services -- are expected to more than double the company's 2023 operating cash flow.\n\nAlthough advertising can be cyclical, Amazon's operating cash flow is fairly insulated against downturns in the U.S. and global economy. While e-commerce generates most of its revenue, the online marketplace is a low-margin segment. The predictability of subscription-services revenue, coupled with enterprise cloud spending still being early in its ramp, all but ensures that Amazon will have more capital than it'll know what to do with.\n\nDon't overlook peer pressure as a catalyst, either. With Meta and Alphabet introducing a dividend over the last three months, Amazon may have little choice but to follow suit in order to maintain its seat at the table among America's most-influential businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia’s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock’s foundation’s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment’s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker’s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm’s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta’s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world’s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML’s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AMD to report Q1 earnings Tuesday as Wall Street looks for jump in AI and PC sales",
        "content": "Chip giant AMD (AMD) will report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. The announcement follows rival Intel’s disappointing report last week. While Intel (INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines, the company provided lower than anticipated revenue guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding.\n\nInvestors and analysts will be looking at two key metrics during AMD’s report: AI chip sales and PC market performance. The company released its MI300 line of AI accelerators in Dec. 2023 and began shipping units shortly thereafter. How well those chips are selling could have a large impact on AMD’s shares following the earnings announcement.\n\nWall Street expects earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That would mark a slight increase from the same quarter last year when AMD reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion.\n\nAMD’s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s (NVDA) best-selling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia’s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia’s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators. Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CMO, AMD speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel on September 26, 2023 in Dana Point, California. (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox Media) (Jerod Harris via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia, however, announced its follow up to the H100 in the form of its Blackwell platform during its GTC conference in March, which should offer better performance than its predecessor.\n\nThe AI arms race isn’t slowing anytime soon, either. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) each announced that they’re pouring money into AI data center capabilities to build out and support their various software offerings.\n\nBut whether AMD can steal significant market share away from market leader Nvidia remains to be seen. According to UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri, MI300X sales should bring in billions this year.\n\n“We still very much see $5 billion to $6 billion as still conservative for MI300 revenue this year and we also see guidance being fine,” he wrote in an investor note ahead of earnings.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is anticipating Data Center revenue of $2.31 billion, which would equate to a year-over-year increase of 78% versus the same period last year.\n\nOutside of AI sales, Wall Street will be looking at the recovery in the PC market and its impact on AMD’s sales. According to IDC, global PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter of 2024, marking the first quarter of growth after two years of declines.\n\nIntel already reported a 31% year-over-year bump in Client Group revenue, the company’s PC chip segment, in its latest quarter. That should bode well for AMD. Both companies are pushing their own AI PCs, or laptops and desktops that can run generative AI apps locally rather than via the web.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are calling for AMD Client revenue, the segment that includes PC chip sales, to jump 74% year-over-year to $1.29 billion in the quarter.\n\nBut Intel and AMD aren’t the only companies pushing for a slice of the AI PC market. Qualcomm (QCOM) is angling for its own cut with its new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips for laptop.\n\nDespite healthy growth projections for its Data Center and Client segments, Wall Street is expecting the company’s Gaming and Embedded divisions to tumble 45% and 40%, respectively.

        "title": "3 Underrated Tech Titans to Buy for Explosive Growth in 2024",
        "content": "As we near the second half of 2024, the correction phase points to a powerful upside potential in underrated tech stocks.\n\nLast year witnessed an extraordinary boom in technology stocks, soaring to uncharted heights. However, the recent warning signs are becoming too loud to ignore, as evidenced by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has slid 2.5% in the past month. This shift in momentum has made investors revamp their investment choices.\n\nDuring this tumultuous transformation, technology behemoths like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost over $750 billion from their respective market capitalizations, exposing the tech sector’s vulnerability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis turbulence has exposed the shortcomings in the major tech stocks while simultaneously revealing untapped potential in the broader market. While investors and the media tend to focus mostly on mega-cap stocks, many underrated businesses are quietly making significant strides. Thus, it is pertinent to identify diamonds in the rough and bet on these three tech stocks for spectacular gains.\n\nUnderrated Tech Stocks: Photronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) shines brightly within the technology industry’s semiconductor equipment and materials niche. Its mastery of photomask manufacturing has led to a mind-boggling 99% year-over-year (YOY) price growth.\n\nIt’s not just the price, though. Photronics maintained resilience, posting a revenue of $216.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, which marks a 2% bump year-over-year. Seasonal fluctuations and a shorter Q1 caused sequential revenue to decline, but annual growth depicts Photronics’ ongoing capacity to increase revenues.\n\nMoreover, Photronics’ top-line growth is greatly driven by its stronghold in advanced technology nodes, such as 22 nm and 28 nm, within the integrated circuit (IC) segment. Customers are moving toward these nodes to maximize savings and improve performance, driving up demand for Photronics’ photomask solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Photronics’ non-GAAP earnings multiple for the trailing year trades at 13.28x, substantially less than the industry average of 21.64x. In contrast to being a valued catch, this distinguishes the continued relevance of photomasks in escalating technological experiences.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a leader in memory and storage solutions, is enhancing its role in the tech sector. It’s ramping up mass production of high bandwidth memory chips that power Nvidia’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips. As Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra boasted at the recent conference: “Our HBM3E product will be a part of Nvidia’s H200 Tensor Core GPUs, and we are progressing on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with Micron’s collaboration with Nvidia, its comeback story is grabbing headlines. Investors can rejoice in the company’s much-anticipated return to profitability. Following five consecutive quarters of negative earnings per share (EPS), Micron posted positive non-GAAP EPS of 42 cents in Q2 2024, exceeding expectations by 66 cents. Moreover, Micron is performing impressively with reported revenue of $5.82 billion, marking a significant 58% YOY upswing from $3.69 billion and surpassing estimates by $473.44 million.\n\nThis sustained trajectory has earned Micron a ‘strong buy’ rating from TipRanks analysts, who predict a robust 10% upside potential, further solidifying Micron’s standing in the tech sector.\n\nUnderrated Tech Stocks: Applied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has excelled as a linchpin in microchip manufacturing equipment. AMAT benefits from this significant advancement as AI applications depend increasingly on sophisticated CPUs. As a result, the company’s stock has taken off, climbing by 25% in 2024 alone. Spread these gains over the past year, and you see an astounding 84.37% bump compared to the S&P 500’s 25.74%. This result reflects the high demand for its cutting-edge equipment, which is essential for creating advanced semiconductors that form the basis of AI technology.\n\nBuilding on this upbeat trajectory, AMAT reported EPS of $2.12 in Q4 2023, topping analyst expectations by 22 cents. Additionally, the business reported revenue of $6.71 billion, outperforming the projected $6.48 billion. This economic stability is further supported by a stellar 46.41% return on common equity for the trailing year, a sign of profitability and efficient capital use.\n\nMoreover, AMAT enhances shareholder value by sweetening the pot with a dividend that has grown for six consecutive years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Monday, April 29, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

Yet, mounting expenses and low capital distribution sustainability are major woes.\n\nSolid Expansion Efforts Aid Marriott (MAR), High Debt Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Marriott benefits from solid leisure demand, solid global booking trends and expansion efforts. However, challenging macro-economic condition and high debt remain a concern.\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX) To Gain On Strong Focus on Midstream Unit\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Phillips 66's (PSX) focus on midstream, renewables and chemicals sectors should aid its cash flow. However, increasing regulatory costs might limit the company's profitability.\n\nStrong Demand for Products Aids The Cooper Companies (COO)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, The Cooper Companies witnessed strong demand for its products across several segments during the first quarter. The trend is likely to continue boosting the company's prospect.\n\nFire & Safety Segment to Drive IDEX (IEX), High Costs Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, IDEX will benefit from strength in Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, led by strong momentum in the fire and rescue businesses.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: April Edition",
        "content": "After a momentous rally in tech stocks over the past several months, the market’s now in correction territory. With many of the biggest tech stocks notching higher highs during the first quarter (Q1) of the year, many had predicted a stock market breather. However, the pullback presents an excellent opportunity for investors to hunt for multibagger tech stocks.\n\nInvesting in the stock market plan without a clear strategy can be incredibly daunting. It’s like being a kid at a candy store with thousands of options. In such a case, investors must narrow down sectors with the most promise for long-term expansion. Betting on long-term trends, especially in the tech space, can potentially generate tremendous gains. With that in mind, I’ve curated a list of potential multibagger tech stocks targeting three of the biggest investing trends in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and resource management.\n\nMultibagger Tech Stocks: SoundHound (SOUN) A sign for SoundHound AI (SOUN) out front of an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a frontrunner in conversational AI, a market poised for colossal expansion over the next few years. It has established a firm foothold in the market, growing rapidly in recent quarters. Moreover, its client list is an exhaustive catalog of the who’s who in tech, telecommunications, dining, and transportation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSOUN stock soared in mid-February, propelled by the news of AI giant Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) ownership position in the firm. Despite a significant pullback in the past month, losing over 30% of its value, the stock has shown resilience. The dip, largely attributed to the company’s plans to sell up to $150 million in new stock, has been met with optimism by analysts who project a potential 23% upside in SOUN stock.\n\nFurthermore, the upside in its stock is also linked to its robust growth trajectory over the next couple of years. The company expects fiscal 2024 sales to fall in the $63 million to $77 million range, beating analyst estimates of $69.73 million at the mid-point. Looking to fiscal 2025, SoundHound expects sales to top an impressive $100 million while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be positive.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM)is an industrial robotics specialist managing supply chains within large warehouse environments. It makes use of robotics and AI to effectively manage distribution center operations with greater efficiency.\n\nThe industrial robotics market is a robust trend in the tech space, demonstrating substantial growth on a global scale. To provide a clear picture, the market was valued at $17 billion in 2023, and is projected to potentially reach $32.5 billion by 2028. A staggering statistic is the total number of robots produced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which skyrocketed by 7,400% to 750,000 from 2013 to 2023. Furthermore, robots handle approximately 75% of all products in Amazon, underscoring the industry’s potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, industry leaders such as Symbotic should benefit immensely from the trend. Its Q1 2024 results showed a 79% increase in sales from the prior-year period. What’s more impressive is that its net loss of $68 million in Q1 2023 dropped by a massive 81% to $13 million in Q1 2024.\n\nItron (ITRI) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Itron, Inc. (ITRI) logo\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nItron (NASDAQ:ITRI) is a tech company that’s developing products and services aimed at managing energy and water resources. Needless to say, it is addressing one of the biggest long-term trends in the management of critical resources. Itron’s innovations in resource management could be pivotal in dealing with the global demand for energy and water.\n\nItron is an excellent stock to invest in overall. It has bounced back impressively from the pandemic-led slowdown to deliver robust sales and earnings growth last year. Moreover, its net income is now firmly in the green after three challenging years of posting net losses. Consequently, ITRI stock shot up more than 79% last year and is up 25% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming the broader market. Despite the ascent though, ITRI stock still trades just 1.85 times forward sales estimates, 35% lower than the sector median. Moreover, Tiprank’s analysts assign a ‘strong buy’ rating to ITRI stock, with a 13% upside from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges",
        "content": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) issued its third quarter earnings report.\n\nYear to date, Microsoft shares are 10% up, behind its tech rivals, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) that are 15% and 22% up, respectively, with the three locked in a battle to show who can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions.\n\nThis week, Microsoft got a pleasant boost from the beverage giant, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) who agreed to infuse Microsoft’s  Azure cloud services and developing AI technology across its business and network.\n\nThird quarter results surpassed estimates.\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, revenue rose 17% YoY to $61.86 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $60.80 billion.\n\nNet income amounted to $21.94 billion or $2.94 per share and also surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $2.82 per share.\n\nOverall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s guidance for $33.93 billion. Intelligent Cloud segment brought in $26.71 billion as sales rose about 21% with Microsoft’s Azure cloud alone growing 31%. AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, rising from second quarter’s 6 percentage points and first quarter’s 3 percentage points.\n\nCapital expenditures jumped 79% to $14 billion. Microsoft has been investing heavily to secure Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units it needs to develop and train AI models. But even with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center infrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models. CFO Amy Hood noted that AI demand could outstrip available capacity in the near-term. Microsoft is certainly not the only AI vendor with this challenge as Nvidia is facing the same issue. Fueled by the AI boom, Nvidia reported its revenue more than tripled over consecutive quarters. Microsoft, being one of its customers, is simply now feeling the stress Nvidia has been facing for a while due to insatiable AI demand. Only a month ago, Microsoft and Nvidia deepened their longstanding collaboration by announcing major integrations to accelerate the development of generative AI for enterprises.\n\nMore Personal Computing revenue rose 18% YoY to $15.58, surpassing StreetAccount consensus of $15.08 billion.  It was driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers, along with 62% growth in sales of Xbox content and services, with 61% being attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's October acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nStory continues\n\nPC demand was slightly better than expected during the quarter and consequently, sales of Windows licenses to device makers rose 11%.\n\nThe Productivity and Business Processes unit that hosts Office software and LinkedIn, among others, reported a revenue rise of 12% as sales amounted to $19.57 billion. This is first full quarter of the Copilot-add-on sales, on which Microsoft invested billions to develop.\n\nFourth quarter guidance was not as impressive.\n\nMicrosoft guided for revenue from $63.5 billion to $64.5 billion in the current quarter. Hood guided for a material rise in capital expenditures due to cloud infrastructure both in the current quarter and in the new fiscal year that will kick off on July 1st.\n\nThe boost from Coca Cola.\n\nThis week, Microsoft revealed it entered into a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement with Coca Cola. The Coca-Cola Company  will use Microsoft’s tech expertise to accelerate system-wide AI transformation across its global business and network of independent bottlers.\n\nAI is key to Microsoft’s prospects, which means its cloud business is running the show.\n\nGrowing faster than any other of its businesses, the Azure brings in revenue of tens of billions of dollars every quarter. Together with AI services that go within its package, Cloud is also Microsoft’s biggest tool in its rivalry against Amazon and its Amazon Web Services. But, Amazon and Microsoft are certainly not the only ones battling for the AI throne as this is still just the beginning of that story and a an entirely new era in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "13 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best growth stocks under $10 to buy. If you want to skip our overview of growth investing and the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy.\n\nThe AI gold rush on Wall Street has enabled indexes to set new records and allowed companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to reshape the valuation dynamics of the stock market. This surge, which has covered any company that investors believe has exposure to the demand for AI hardware and software, has also shown that growth stocks are the right way to go when considering profits through share price appreciation.\n\nThese stocks are those that are determined by investors to have significant competitive advantages that can ensure that their future earnings are significantly higher than current levels. This optimism is reflected through their share prices, and analysts and investors measure the investor sentiment through the price to earnings ratio. The higher the P/E ratio is compared to the industry benchmark, the more investors believe that the future is bright. At the same time, growth stocks are also among the riskiest in the market.\n\nThis is because the value of a stock is a reflection of the investors' belief in its future. A share price shows what investors expect a company can earn in the future, with these expectations adding to the potential fundamental based valuation that might be baked into the share price. Consequently, since expectations can be fickle, and in today's fast paced news environment news spreads like wildfire, the share price can tank much faster than it took to build the gains.\n\nIn fact, we don't have to sift through many growth stocks to understand this risk. Continuing with our discussion of NVIDIA, the firm's trailing P/E ratio currently sits at 69.09 while the forward P/E ratio is 34.25. The recent growth in its earnings has brought this valuation down to earth, since as recently as in July 2023, NVIDIA's trailing P/E ratio was 243.38. So how does this relate to the risks with growth stocks? Well, in April 2024, another AI stock, the San Jose, California based semiconductor firm Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to release a preliminary earnings report ahead of its earnings for the first quarter of 2024. While it's normal for firms to not post this report, for Super Micro, it was a deviation from historic norms that led analysts to wonder if there was something amiss that the firm was uncertain of declaring before its official results came out.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the growth expectations that were baked into semiconductor growth AI stocks had to shift. For Super Micro, the aftermath was devastating as the shares tanked by a whopping 23% despite the fact that its P/E ratio has floated around 20 - 25 for most of the past twelve months. For NVIDIA, the firm that had a triple digit P/E ratio the news was just as bad, as, despite no fault of its own, the re calibration of investor expectations that are baked into a growth stock also led to a 10% NVIDIA share price drop.\n\nSince NVIDIA is heading into yet another crucial earnings release, and now with the backdrop of potential trouble at Super Micro, let's see what the hedge funds are saying about this growth stock. Here's one such excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the fourth quarter of 2023:\n\nGiven many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peaks.\n\nWe believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, but we also believe the long-term growth outcomes are currently too variable, and the expectations built into the company’s $1.2 trillion valuation as of this writing assume the most optimistic of those scenarios.\n\nSo, as the first quarter of 2024 earnings season is shaping to be quite an interesting one indeed, let's take a look at some growth stocks that are trading for under $10. A couple of notable picks are NexGen Energy Ltd. (NYSE:NXE), BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC), and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (NYSE:AQN). 13 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy\n\nA money manager at a desk crowded with financial reports and data screens.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best growth stocks under $10, we selected 32 stocks that are under $10, have a P/E ratio greater than 50, and have a market capitalization greater than $300 million.

        "title": "Badger Meter and Nutrien have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 29, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Badger Meter BMI as the Bull of the Day and Nutrien NTR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nBadger Meter, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a global provider of industry-leading water solutions that include flow measurement, quality, and other system parameters. Its offerings provide customers with the data and analytics essential to optimize their operations and contribute to the sustainable use and protection of water.\n\nAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board.\n\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Instruments – Control industry, currently ranked in the top 37% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\n\nBadger Meter\n\nBadger Meter shares have displayed a nice level of relative strength over the last three months, gaining 26% compared to the S&P 500’s 3% gain. Shares popped post-earnings following its latest release, with investors pleased with the results.\n\nConcerning the above-mentioned release, BMI exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 17% and posted sales 7% ahead of the consensus, reflecting growth rates of 50% and 24%, respectively. The company’s sales growth has remained considerably strong over the last several years.\n\nIncome-focused investors could also be interested, with BMI shares currently yielding 0.6% annually. And the company has consistently increasingly rewarded its shareholders, boasting a 12% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nConsensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggest 24% higher earnings on 14% higher sales, with FY25 expectations alluding to an additional 10% pop in earnings paired with a 4% sales climb.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\n\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nBadger Meter would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nNutrien, a current Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a leading integrated provider of crop inputs and services through its leading global retail network. Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s outlook across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 14% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\n\nNutrien\n\nNutrien shares have faced a rocky road over the last year, down more than 20% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500. Quarterly results have consistently come in below expectations as of late, with NTR falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 35% across its last four releases.\n\nThe less-than-ideal performance from shares has boosted its yield considerably, paying 4.2% on an annual basis.\n\nKeep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on May 8th, as current consensus expectations suggest a 67% pullback in earnings on 12% lower sales. Revenue expectations have been similarly taken lower, with the $5.4 billion expected down 1% since the beginning of February.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnalysts' negative earnings estimate revisions paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.\n\nNutrien is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.\n\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). These stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook and the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nBitcoin Rally Poised to Resume: 3 Stocks to Bet On\n\nThe cryptocurrency market, which hit record highs in the first quarter, has slowed down over the past couple of weeks. Bitcoin (BTC), which hit an all-time high of $73,750 on Mar 14, has since then pulled back sharply and is now trading below $65,000.\n\nIn the past month, Bitcoin has fallen more than 8.2%. However, year to date, it has gained 45.4%, which is evidence of the underlying strength of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nThat said, the cryptocurrency market holds tremendous potential. The rally, which started in 2023, continued into this year and gathered pace in the second week of January after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThis approval marked a significant milestone in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance and is expected to offer consistent backing to the sector in the coming years.\n\nThe recent decline is thus temporary and being fueled by two major factors. First, the recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East between Iran and Israel\n\nCryptocurrencies, being traded continuously and globally, have immediate and often more pronounced effects compared to stocks. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies enables rapid responses to geopolitical events, with traders swiftly buying or selling digital assets to manage uncertainty.\n\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin halving event, occurring once every four years, is underway. During this event, the reward for mining new blocks is halved. Historically, the halving has increased scarcity, making it more challenging for miners to generate a net increase in Bitcoins. As a result, Bitcoin's value typically sees an uptick during these periods of reduced supply.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 559.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 141.6% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc.is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR’s commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.4% over the last 60 days. IBKR currently has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Jim Simons Just Bought These 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "A good way to spot trends in the stock market is to look at which companies asset management firms are investing in. While there are a lot of hedge funds out there, one of the more closely followed portfolios hails from Renaissance Technologies.\n\nRenaissance is led by Jim Simons, who is actually a mathematician by trade. A look at the fund's most recent filings shows one clear trend: Renaissance is investing heavily in the technology sector right now.\n\nBut with just about every tech company parroting their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, it can become hard to discern the winners from the wannabes. Let's dig into Renaissance's portfolio and assess the most bullish opportunities from Simons and his team.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the third-largest position in Renaissance's portfolio, and the biggest among its \"Magnificent Seven\" holdings.\n\nWhat I find interesting about Nvidia's prominence in the portfolio compared to other tech stocks is its relationship with Renaissance's largest holding overall: Novo Nordisk. Although Renaissance trimmed its position in the Ozempic maker by 2.4 million shares last quarter, Novo Nordisk is still handily the top position in Simons' portfolio. Following a milestone year in 2023, Novo Nordisk recently teamed up with Nvidia to help accelerate AI in the healthcare world. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow during each quarter of the last 10 years. The obvious takeaway is that the newfound demand fueling AI services has ignited a new growth frontier for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, there's more to the picture here. Nvidia is playing a monumentally important role in the AI revolution. The company's H100 and A100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main engine fueling myriad AI applications, including training generative AI models, enhancing accelerated computing, and more.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are being deployed in Tesla vehicles to help with autonomous driving and are also being leveraged by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to hone its targeted advertising capabilities in an intensely crowded social media landscape.\n\nThe superior pricing power that Nvidia has achieved over the competition has resulted in staggering profit growth. As an investor, what's encouraging to see is that Nvidia is aggressively investing its profits into other high-growth opportunities.\n\nFor example, earlier this year Nvidia joined OpenAI, Intel, and Microsoft in a $675 million funding round for a humanoid robotics start-up called Figure AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think this is a particularly savvy move as Nvidia has a lucrative opportunity to help Figure AI's development from both a hardware and software perspective. In a way, owning Nvidia is similar to owning an index fund focused on several aspects of the AI realm.\n\nNvidia operates across semiconductor chips, robotics, enterprise software, and data center services. The prolific nature of its business is leading to a variety of AI-powered applications, and paving the way for a robust long-term roadmap.\n\nConsidering the enormous opportunities Nvidia orbits, it's not surprising to see the company earn such a high position in a highly regarded portfolio such as Renaissance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms rounds out the top five positions in the Renaissance portfolio. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Renaissance bought a whopping 2 million shares of Meta stock -- an increase of over 2,000% from its prior allocation.\n\n2023 was a transformational year for Meta, and I'm not surprised to see smart money pouring into the stock.\n\nLast year, Meta underwent several rounds of layoffs in an effort to reduce its expense profile -- which briefly became bloated following some hefty investments related to the metaverse in 2022. Moreover, the company doubled down on its core advertising business and proved that it can fend off rising competition from the likes of Alphabet and TikTok.\n\nThe table below illustrates some important operating metrics for Meta:\n\nMetric 2022 2023 Change Revenue $116.6 billion $134.9 billion 16% Operating income $28.9 billion $46.7 billion 62% Free cash flow $18.4 billion $43.0 billion 134%\n\nData source: Meta.\n\nMeta's return to respectable top-line growth combined with disciplined cost controls ultimately led to soaring profitability. The company demonstrated a true sign of maturity by announcing that it will be reinvesting these profits in the form of a dividend and an increased share repurchase program.\n\nConsidering Meta's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.5 is currently the second lowest among the Magnificent Seven, I think the stock looks especially attractive as sales and profits look to be back on the right track.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nThe last company I'll be exploring is Renaissance's sixth-largest holding, e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nI see Amazon in a similar light to that of Nvidia. While the company is largely known for its online store, Amazon is a far more prolific business. The company is a leader in cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and it also operates in the worlds of streaming and advertising.\n\nThe trends below hit on an important theme for Amazon investors. AMZN Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLingering inflation and high borrowing costs took a toll on Amazon's business over the last couple of years. However, 2023 was somewhat of a rebound year as Amazon sharply turned back to a consistently cash-flow-positive business. And just like Nvidia, Amazon is deploying this cash to ignite new growth.\n\nBack in September, Amazon committed to a $4 billion investment in AI start-up Anthropic. The overarching thesis of the deal was to integrate Anthropic into AWS to help unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nMoreover, AI has the potential to span across Amazon's entire ecosystem. For example, the technology can help Amazon discover cost efficiencies that it can integrate into warehouse and fulfillment centers, as well as new marketing tactics that it can employ for both the e-commerce and advertising segments.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 is essentially identical to its 10-year average, making it a compelling buy for long-term investors.\n\nI think Simons is onto something with his specific Magnificent Seven allocations, and I see each of the companies discussed above as solid opportunities for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Incredible Rally? 1 Magnificent Growth ETF to Buy Now.",
        "content": "Investors have been excited about many different growth areas over the years, but few topics have sparked as much enthusiasm as artificial intelligence (AI). Companies with even modest exposure to that area have soared in the past year, sometimes without even showing how they might capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is an exception to that rule. The chipmaker is directly benefiting from intense demand for its graphics processing units, which form the foundation for data centers that are being built by many of the biggest tech giants on the planet. Nvidia's sales were up a blazing 265% last quarter to $22 billion .\n\nThe stock's rally, though, has made the stock an incredibly expensive way to gain exposure to the AI boom. Up more than 400% in the past three years, Nvidia shares are now valued at 34 times sales, making it by far the most expensive of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nThere's a better way to gain exposure to Nvidia and to the wider AI space -- without exposing yourself to ultra-high levels of risk.\n\nMeet the Vanguard Growth ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Growth Fund(NYSEMKT: VUG) is an exchange traded fund (ETF) that's focused on the largest, fastest growing stocks on U.S. stock market. It tracks the performance of the CSPR U.S. Large Cap Growth Index by owning roughly 200 stocks. The fund invests in roughly all market sectors, including real estate, energy, and telecommunications. Yet you can see by its top 10 holdings list that the ETF mainly concerns itself with tech giants. Those holdings are:\n\n1. Microsoft, 13%\n\n2. Apple, 10%\n\n3. Nvidia, 9%\n\n4. Amazon, 7%\n\n5. Meta Platforms, 4%\n\n6. Alphabet, 4%\n\n7. Alphabet C, 3%\n\n8. Eli Lily, 3%\n\n9. Tesla, 2%\n\n10. Visa, 2%\n\nThese stocks are among the most popular on the market these days, and that helps explain why the Vanguard growth ETF has outperformed so many peers. It has jumped 33% in the past year compared to the 22% rally in the S&P 500.\n\nHeavily exposed to the tech sector\n\nThere's still plenty of risk involved in owning this ETF despite its highly diverse collection of businesses. The tech sector represents nearly 60% of its assets today, and so a downturn in that area would hurt your short-term return, especially if you own a few individual stocks that land in its top holdings list.\n\nTech giants tends to do well during cyclical upturns like the one investors have seen in the past year but often fall hard when fears are rising about a recession. As a result, this ETF won't provide much protection when markets start heading south. For a more defensive tilt, consider something like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, you'll get to own Nvidia along with several other companies that are taking advantage of the AI boom by owning this growth-focused ETF. Costs are extremely low as well, with expenses landing at just $4 per $10,000 invested. Peers in this space charge $100 or more for each $10,000 invested.\n\nIt's true that the ETF won't soar as quickly as Nvidia could given its wider focus. Investors can still enjoy above-average returns from this tech-focused fund that includes the chipmaker as a relatively small part of its blockbuster growth portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: SoundHound AI vs. C3.ai",
        "content": "I like SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN). It's an experienced innovator with a unique position in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, focused on voice-control systems and advanced audio analysis.\n\nI'm also a fan of C3.ai(NYSE: AI). Founded and led by serial innovator Tom Siebel (yes, the namesake innovator behind enterprise software veteran Siebel Systems), C3 develops industry-specific AI solutions for a wide range of target industries.\n\nBut which AI expert would I rather buy right now? Both companies are deeply unprofitable growth stories so far. How can you pick one over the other?\n\nI respect both companies, but only one strikes me as a great buy right now. You can cheat and jump ahead to my disclosure statement below, if you want. You'll find out that I own one of these stocks but not the other. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.\n\nHow these companies rely on AI\n\nC3.ai offers a suite of enterprise AI software designed to tackle complex business problems, providing AI solutions tailored for specific industries such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Their broad approach aims to embed AI across a variety of business functions to drive efficiencies and predictive analytics.\n\nSoundHound AI specializes in voice-based AI technologies. Their focus is on developing conversational intelligence that powers voice assistants across diverse markets, from automotive controls and drive-through order windows to consumer electronics and phone-service menu systems. It uses a more advanced voice interpretation system than most rivals, based on deep learning and several layers of AI-powered analytics.\n\nThe competitive landscape\n\nSoundHound AI's holds a very specific niche position in voice AI, including a unique approach to the voice analysis. Hence, it enjoys a distinct position with very little direct competition. Alternative song-identification experts usually prefer a simpler audio analytics approach, based on audio fingerprints of specific recordings. That method didn't prepare Shazam to explore wider business opportunities outside the field of song-matching, while SoundHound AI found new applications for its audio tech in many other businesses.\n\nC3.ai can match its audio-specific opponent's flexibility in many ways. The company's eponymous home page lists 10 specific target industries with specific case studies in 8 sectors. Its machine learning tools can help clients analyze oil reserves, manage supply lines, research new vaccines, add generative AI smarts to manufacturing services, and more.\n\nWhy I'd rather buy SoundHound AI today\n\nIn the end, C3.ai's growth-promoting research and development is less effective than SoundHound AI's.\n\nStory continues\n\nC3.ai puts many man-hours (and machine hours) into developing and fine-tuning each industry-specific solution. SoundHound AI's fundamental platform can serve many different functions with less fine-tuning and expensive packaging of customer-specific solutions.\n\nAnd I already mentioned how sparse the audio analytics field is, giving SoundHound AI room to run. In C3.ai's corner of the AI market, the company butts heads with direct rivals such as IBM(NYSE: IBM), Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), and Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). It's a mighty group, all pursuing a very large global market for enterprise-oriented AI solutions.\n\nSo SoundHound AI has a much clearer path to long-term growth than C3.ai. It chose to specialize on an ultra-specific technology many years ago, and that decision is paying dividends in the form of a largely unchallenged leadership position today.\n\nFinally, the stock is not as expensive as it looks. SoundHound AI's stock price has more than doubled in 2024, thanks to speculative furor around a modest investment by AI giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But about half of the speculation-driven price surge has already faded out, and the stock was deeply undervalued before the pop. Today, SoundHound AI's market cap stands at $1.4 billion with a $661 million balance of unfilled order and subscription backlogs in the books. And that backlog doubled in 2023.\n\nAnd there you have it. C3.ai may be a decent investment in the long run, but it faces a brutally competitive market and requires heavy R&D investments to stay relevant. SoundHound AI is deceptively cheap, standing tall in a less rivalry-packed field.\n\nThat's why I own SoundHound AI and not C3.ai. Even if you end up owning both, I think you should take a closer look at the audio expert first.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $537,557!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul from Texas's 10th congressional district is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul was one of the leading politicians calling for a ban on TikTok.  He authored the bill against the Chinese social media company which the US Senate recently passed, calling TikTok a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" President Joe Biden has signed the bill into law that would ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance fails to divest the app within a year.\n\nCongressman McCaul's Purchase of Meta Platforms Gains Attention\n\nBut when Congressman McCaul was working against TikTok, he was also busy amassing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, according to his public disclosures. On March 5, the Congressman bought Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares worth between $100,000 to $250,000 at $490.22 per share. On March 1, he had bought somewhere between 200-498 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, at $502.3 per share. Analysts believe a ban on  TikTok would be a tailwind for US social media companies like Meta Platforms and Snapchat. Because of such overlaps, calls for a total ban on stock trading for politicians have been growing louder. But we aren’t interested in any such bans, since as retail investors any publicly available data showing what insiders are buying is an opportunity. Why?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nStock trades from politicians in the US have always sparked controversies and made headlines over the past few years. In 2022, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that thousands of officials working across 50 federal agencies were involved in buying or selling of stocks of companies that were directly affected by the decisions of their agencies. The Journal analyzed about 31,000 disclosures of 12,000 officials made during 2016 through 2021.\n\nDo Politicians Beat the Market?\n\nHowever, the most important question in any discussion surrounding American politicians trading stocks is this: do politicians' stock picks really beat the market? A detailed research by Unusual Whales found that in 2022, out of the 100 Congress members who traded stocks, 33% beat SPY with their portfolios. Another interesting insight highlighted in the report said that Democrats beat Republicans by significant margins. However, there were some anomalies. For example, former House Speak Nany Pelosi's portfolio, which is often a topic of discussion and is keenly watched by investors, fell about 19.8% in 2022, more than the 18% decline for the SPY.\n\nStory continues\n\nPoliticians' stock picking skills received massive attention during the pandemic days. For example, Senator Rand Paul's wife bought shares in Gilead Sciences just before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. So what? Analysts were quick to highlight that Paul was part of a Senate health committee that received special briefings from the then government about the pandemic situation in January 2020. American Politicians are Selling These Stocks\n\nThere have been several research reports highlighting instances where politicians used their influence to allegedly profit from different deals. For example a research paper titled “Trading” Political Favors: Evidence from the Impact of the STOCK Act\" talked about an interesting case from 2009:\n\n\"Politicians can favor certain groups of firms or individual firms in decisions that have significant economic impact on firm performance, such as the passage of legislations and regulations, the awarding of government contracts, and the selection into government programs. An example can be found in Congressman Tom Petri’s dealings with the Oshkosh Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and military vehicles. 2 In 2009, Representative Petri helped Oshkosh secure a $3 billion contract from the U.S. Army, after the award was challenged by a competitor and then under review by the Government Accountability Office, by sending letters and memos to colleagues and officials on the Hill and at the Pentagon including the Defense Secretary, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Army. Meanwhile, Petri owned a substantial amount of Oshkosh stock, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, and purchased additional shares as he was making contacts on behalf of the company to resolve the dispute. Oshkosh’s stock price rose from $8 per share in early 2009 to $38 per share in February 2010, when its contract with the Army was finalized.\n\nMethodology For this article we scanned publicly available data and filings of American politicians and picked 10 stocks Congress members and senators were selling over the past few months. Some top names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n10. BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nCongressman Scott Franklin from the Republican Party on March 21 sold a stake worth between $1 million to $5 million in insurance company BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP). Since then through April 24 BRP Group Inc's (NASDAQ:BRP) shares have lost about 8% in value.\n\nIn addition to BRP, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also seeing insider selling.\n\n9. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nGreg Steube, the Republican Congressman from Florida's 17th congressional district, on March 28 sold shares in Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV) worth between $15,000 to $50,000 at $40.06 per share. Since then the stock is down 8%.\n\n8. Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nSenator Tina Smith dumped insulin delivery systems company Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) shares on April 4 at $163.25. The total worth of these shares was between $50,000 to $100,000. Since then the stock is up 2.45%. Senator Markwayne Mullin also sold a stake in Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) back in December 2024.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n7. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nNextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks sold by American politicians in 2024. Senator Tina Smith sold a stake worth between $100,000 to $250,000 in NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) on April 4. Since then the stock has gained about 4.43%. Congressman Rick Allen also sold NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) shares worth between $15,000 to $50,000 back in December 2024.\n\nClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added a new position in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), in the utilities sector, which acquires, owns and manages contracted clean energy projects in the U.S. The company was at the center of the defensive stock storm when it slowed its renewable growth outlook modestly in late September, and the stock collapsed almost 30% in less than two weeks. We saw this as an opportunity to invest in arguably the best combination of a regulated utility and an experienced renewable operator with good long-term growth options. Even at a much-reduced estimated growth rate from higher financing costs, which will likely prove to be conservative, our estimate of intrinsic business value is materially higher.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NEE is also seeing selling from Washington insiders.\n\n6. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to suffer amid safety concerns around its planes. The stock is down 34% this year through April 25. Congressman Bill Keating from the Democratic Party on February 8 dumped a stake worth between $15,000 to $50,000 in Boein. He had also sold Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares worth between $1K to $15K on February 28 at $207 per share. Since February 8 through April 24 Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are down 21%.\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nLatest Insider Trading Activity: 11 Stocks Executives and Directors are Buying 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 12 ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now.\n\nIn a world where inflation remains sticky, interest rates high and markets uncertain, why would anyone think of investing in individual stocks let alone riskier, volatile penny stocks? Isn't just investing your money in index funds a safer, better option? While the jury is still out when it comes to this question, data keeps showing that sensibly investing in individual stocks is still rewarding long-term investors with major gains. Bloomberg in a latest report mentioned several hedge funds and money managers who are crushing it by successfully beating the market with just a handful of stock picks. Oftentimes these are small-cap companies with strong growth catalysts. Some of these funds rode the AI wave by timely investing in large-cap tech stocks like Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHedge Funds Making Big Money Investing in Small Companies\n\nFor example, a small-cap fund run by Crimson Asset Management, based in Canada, has reportedly returned 10.2% annual since its inception in 2018. This was double the performance of the small cap-focused Russell 20000 index.  Crimson's website says that since its inception its small-cap fund has outperformed the Russell 2000 by+4.4% net of all fees and expenses on an annualized basis.\n\nAnother great example of funds beating the market by taking risks in the current environment is of billionaire Rajiv Jain, who founded GQG Partners, which has over $47 billion in managed securities as of the end of 2023. Jain's fund has managed to return 13% annually since its inception in 2016, double the gain of its benchmark, according to the Bloomberg report. When investors were exiting Adani Group shares following a scathing short report by Hindenburg Research last year, Jain was piling into the conglomerate's shares. When the Gautam Adani-led empire rebounded, Jain's bets paid off. The Bloomberg report cited Jain as saying:\n\n\"We are a business of taking risks. You have to be uncomfortable sometimes. If you look like an index all the time, guess what? You get indexlike returns.\"\n\nIt might be easy for Jain, worth over $4 billion, to say that you should keep taking risks. But can beginner investors also act as contrarian investors in the current market environment without breaking the bank? ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We Have Not Lived by the Magnificent 7 and We Ought Not Die by Them\"\n\nAkre Focused Fund, run by Akre Capital Management of legendary value investor Chuck Akre, shared some interesting insights in its Q1 letter to investors, highlighting how it was able to beat the market without relying on the Magnificent Seven stocks. The fund's commentary said that while the Mag. 7 companies of today have strong fundamentals and the stock market today isn’t anything like the late-90s internet bubble, sooner or later their valuations would reach questionable levels.\n\n\"The problem is that financial excess is often built on kernels of truth: exotic tulips were rare in the Netherlands; the South Sea Company’s exclusive rights to international trade would prove lucrative; the Internet would, in fact, change the world; housing prices nationally only went up. However strong a foundation, financial markets can build valuations up past the point of structural soundness. And in today’s heavily “instructed” market environment, where momentum begets momentum regardless of value, this risk is not lessened. Will the Magnificent 7 defy market history and drive index performance over the next decade just as they did the preceding? Time will tell. In the meantime, we will stick to our knitting: concentrating capital in what we believe to be exceptional businesses, managed by great people, with extensive reinvestment opportunity and acumen. All the while making judgments about value. We have not lived by the Magnificent 7 and we ought not die by them. For us, that’s one less thing to worry about.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nThe market is always teeming with investing opportunities and smart investors are always finding them. While we keep telling our readers about what stocks are being picked up by smart investors, in this article we decided to turn to AI to ask its opinion on top penny stocks it believes have the potential to grow. We asked ChatGPT which penny stocks have the strongest upside potential.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Stanley Druckenmiller Is Betting on the Most",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the world's most closely followed billionaire investors. He engineered George Soros' famous bet against the British pound in 1992 and generated an average annual return of 30% for his hedge fund, Duquesne Capital, for three decades after its inception in 1986.\n\nDruckenmiller retired and closed his fund in 2010 but continues to manage $3.1 billion in assets through his own Duquesne Family Office. Many investors still keep a close eye on the firm's portfolio to see what Druckenmiller is bullish on.\n\nAs of this writing, two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- are among the Duquesne Family Office's top investments. Microsoft is its largest position and occupies 13.1% of its portfolio, while Nvidia ranks third at 9.8%. It's currently sitting on unrealized gains of 43% and 341%, respectively, on Microsoft and Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy is Stanley Druckenmiller bullish on Microsoft?\n\nDruckenmiller starting accumulating more shares of Microsoft at the beginning of 2023. Those purchases coincided with the explosive growth of its AI-oriented businesses.\n\nBack when Satya Nadella took the helm as Microsoft's third CEO in 2014, he prioritized the expansion of its cloud and mobile businesses. Over the following decade, the company transformed many of its desktop-based applications into cloud-based services, expanded Azure into the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform, and rolled out more mobile applications for iOS and Android instead of trying to build its own mobile platform.\n\nBut over the past five years, Microsoft also ramped up its investments in OpenAI, the developer of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E. It integrated those tools into its own cloud-based search, productivity, and infrastructure services.\n\nMicrosoft's integration of OpenAI's tools into Azure enabled it to grow much faster than its larger competitor, Amazon Web Services (AWS), over the past year. The integration of those generative AI tools into its Bing search engine and Office productivity software also threatened to disrupt Alphabet's Google's sprawling ecosystem of cloud-based search and productivity services. That's probably why Druckenmiller sold all of his shares of Amazon and Alphabet at the end of 2023 while buying more shares of Microsoft.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow 8% and 11%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends this June). For fiscal 2025, they expect the company's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 14% and 15%, respectively. The stock isn't cheap at 31 times forward earnings, but it remains one of the most straightforward ways to invest in the booming AI services market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is Stanley Druckenmiller bullish on Nvidia?\n\nDruckenmiller also initiated a position in Nvidia in early 2023. During a conference that June, he declared that he could own Nvidia for \"two or three more years\" -- and maybe even longer -- as AI becomes as \"innovative as the internet.\"\n\nThat statement isn't too surprising because Nvidia is the leading producer of high-end data center graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing complex AI tasks. The chipmaker generated a whopping 78% of its revenue from those data center GPUs in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% as its adjusted EPS soared 288%. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue to rise 82% and 89%, respectively. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at 34 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia could eventually face competition from cheaper data center GPU makers like AMD, first-party chips from data center giants like Microsoft, and other types of dedicated AI accelerator chips. But for now, it remains the leading supplier of picks and shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could still have plenty of room to grow.\n\nDruckenmiller notably reduced his stake in Nvidia in the second half of 2023, but he also bought more call options on the stock. Those moves suggest he's taking some profits after Nvidia's historic run but remains bullish on its long-term prospects.\n\nShould you follow Druckenmiller's lead on these two AI stocks?\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the generative AI market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% from 2023 to 2030. That secular expansion could light a blazing fire under Microsoft's AI-powered cloud services and Nvidia's GPUs -- so it's smart to follow Druckenmiller's lead and buy these two high-flying Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on Jim Cramer's latest thoughts about the economy and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week welcomed signs of an economic slowdown, saying \"finally\" he is seeing \"brown shoots\" that could signal the Wall Street that the Fed might be winning its battle against inflation. Jim Cramer admitted that \"it's been hard to parse this economy.\" He said in March when a \"steaming hot\" jobs report came, it seemed like the Fed was \"blindsided\" because it was talking about multiple rate cuts this year.\n\n\"You don’t do that when the job market is booming. Anything that makes the Fed look stupid hurts its ability to maintain price stability.\"\n\nCramer Welcomes \"Brown Shoots\" Signaling Economic Slowdown\n\nJim Cramer said that just when the Wall Street was about to give up on the possibility of rate hikes, we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown. To back his thesis, Cramer talked about some examples depicting a broader cooldown in the economy. He said J. B. Hunt, the Arkansas-based transportation and logistics company, had a strong January and February but its business \"shrunk\" in March and the company's total operating revenue fell 9% during the first quarter.\n\nCramer also mentioned logistics and warehouse REIT Prologis. He said the company lowered its guidance just a month after \"coming to this show.\" Cramer was referring to Prologis CEO Hamid Moghadam's interview on CNBC with Cramer where, according to the Mad Money host, the company gave a \"bullish story.\" Cramer said during the interview the company indicated that it was experiencing weakness only in California but now it seems those problems are spreading to other areas too including Seattle and New Jersey. Cramer said part of the reason why these companies suffered is a possible slowdown in the ecommerce market.\n\n\"Because even ecommerce isn’t safe and that, you can feel.\"\n\nSnap-On Inc (NYSE:SNA) was another stock mentioned by Cramer whose earnings show signs of an economic slowdown in the US following rate hikes. The tools and equipment company posted some \"really weak numbers\" according to Cramer, and he believes that's a \"genuine surprise\" from a usually reliable company.\n\nAnother surprise came from Sherwin-Williams, which indicated that it's feeling \"choppiness\" in the business. Cramer said \"anything home related\" has been quite strong until now. But following the latest numbers, Cramer said Sherwin-Williams shares got \"clobbered.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSherwin-Williams mentioned the world \"choppiness\" or \"choppy\" several times during its Q1 earnings call. Here's a comment from Sherwin-Williams CEO from the Q1 earnings call:\n\n\"While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I’m going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we’re doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range.\"\n\nRead the full Q1 earnings call transcript here. Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he recently recommended investors to buy or hold. Instead of major names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been repeatedly recommending for the long term, you will see some new names in the list.\n\n11. Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nMexico-based energy company Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on. When asked about Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) in a recent program, Cramer said Mexico has changed some rules in the industry which would be \"good\" for Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST). Cramer said that he would \"actually own\" this stock.\n\n\"I think it's a good situation.\"\n\n10. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nBiopharma company Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM) is a latest Jim Cramer stock pick because of obesity-related growth catalysts. When asked about the company, Cramer said it's a speculative play  but emphasized that he is \"not against speculating biotechs right now.\"\n\n\"Looks like that there are so many bids, I'm willing to let a stock catch fire,\" Cramer added.\n\n9. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nCramer said that \"people didn’t like\" the latest PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) quarter. But he disagrees:\n\n\"I on the other hand felt it was an enjoyable quarter.\"\n\nCramer recommended investors to buy some PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) shares now and buy more when the stock comes down about 10%.\n\n\"You'll have a terrific position that will last a very long time,\" Cramer said.\n\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and JPMorgan performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”\n\n8. Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nAxon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) makes technology and weapons for law enforcement and military. Jim Cramer thinks this company is an \"ecosystem of law enforcement.\"\n\nJim Cramer said Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) is good \"even here.\" Over the past six months, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) shares have gained about 53%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the company.\n\nLike AXON, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer recently hit the \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" button on Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), saying the company's CEO Matthew Prince \"rocks.\" Cramer said he'd be a \"buyer\" of this stock. However, the CNBC host said he's buy Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) \"slowly\" because there's a lot of \"big selling\" going on. In addition to NET, Cramer recommends Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the tech industry for the long term.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\n6. Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is recommending investors to hold Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) because of its high dividend yield. Cramer in a program earlier this month said the company has been \"mismanaged\" but he thinks Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) can \"bottom here\" because of its over 6% dividend yield.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds, 45 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) as of the end of 2023.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nearly Tripled the S&amp;P 500's Returns in 2023: Here Are the Stocks She's Been Buying",
        "content": "Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has multiple major accomplishments on her resume. She's been a U.S. Representative for nearly 37 years. She's the first female Speaker of the House and the first woman to lead either chamber of Congress. Is she also a market-beating investor?\n\nThe former House Speaker nearly tripled the S&P 500's returns in 2023, giving her the ninth-best returns among members of Congress, according to options trading platform operator Unusual Whales. However, all of Pelosi's disclosures of trades listed her husband, Paul Pelosi, as the owner.\n\nPelosi's recent purchases\n\nOver the last 12 months, Pelosi has purchased only two stocks. Both are also favorites of many other investors.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, the former Speaker's husband exercised 50 call options to buy 5,000 shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for $80 per share. Apple's current share price is more than double this purchase price.\n\nMr. Pelosi has owned Apple stock for years. Other members of Congress or their families have also invested in the tech giant. Apple was second on the list of stocks lawmakers bought the most in 2023.\n\nOn the same day of the Apple transaction, Pelosi also exercised 50 call options to purchase 5,000 shares of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) for $180 per share. As with Apple, Microsoft's current share price is more than twice the strike price of those options.\n\nMore options\n\nThe initial purchases of the moneymaking call options for Apple and Microsoft were made in 2022. Paul Pelosi has been buying more call options on other stocks in recent months.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2023, Mr. Pelosi bought 50 call options for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20. 2024. At the time, Nvidia's share price was around $488.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2024, Pelosi purchased 50 call options for Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. Palo Alto Networks' share price then hovered around $372.\n\nA few days later on Feb. 21, 2024, the former Speaker's husband bought 20 more call options for Palo Alto Networks. Again, the strike price was $200 with an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. The stock had fallen significantly, though, to around $262.\n\nCall options with a strike price lower than the current share price are known as \"in-the-money\" options. Buying in-the-money call options lowers investors' upfront costs and limits the risk of loss while allowing them to profit from upward moves for the underlying stock.\n\nAre Pelosi's picks good choices now?\n\nValuation is a concern with all four stocks Pelosi likes. Apple's sluggish growth arguably doesn't justify its forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 26. Microsoft and Nvidia trade at well above 30 times forward earnings, while Palo Alto Networks' forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 47.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia should profit from the generative AI boom for years to come. The need for cybersecurity solutions should grow, boosting Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks. I think Pelosi's picks are good choices for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Are the 3 ETFs I Can't Stop Buying in 2024",
        "content": "I'm a big believer in the idea that investors with the time, knowledge, and desire to do so can beat the market over time with a portfolio of individual stocks. However, when I've added money to my retirement accounts recently, most of it has been used to buy shares of high-quality, low-cost index fund ETFs.\n\nThere are a few reasons I'm focusing more on index funds than individual stock investing in my retirement account this year.\n\nI've spent most of my 12 years covering the stock market building a portfolio of individual stocks that could be excellent retirement investments. Just to name a few, top holdings in my retirement account include Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.B), Realty Income(NYSE: O), and Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS). There is nothing wrong with using ETFs to establish a \"core\" for a portfolio of individual stocks, and my portfolio's core isn't quite where it should be. I'm getting older. While I'm in my early 40s and still a couple of decades away from retirement, my risk tolerance is significantly lower than when I was 22 and opening my first brokerage account. There are some excellent opportunities for investing in entire indices because of short-term headwinds like higher interest rates. More on that in a bit.\n\nI won't keep you in suspense. Here are the three ETFs I've been buying in 2024 when I deposit money into my retirement account.\n\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nWhile the S&P 500 isn't particularly cheap right now at about 3% below its all-time high, a basic S&P 500 ETF is still a great long-term addition to any retirement portfolio. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is one of the cheapest index funds in the market, with a 0.03% expense ratio, which means just $3 will go toward fees annually for every $10,000 in assets.\n\nI'm adding this ETF not because I think it will outperform over the next year or two, but because I'm extremely confident that by the time I'm ready to retire my investment will be worth significantly more than I paid for it. After all, simply matching the market's performance over time isn't such a bad thing. ^SPXTR Chart\n\nVanguard Small-Cap Value ETF\n\nTwo of my favorite opportunities in the stock market right now are small-cap stocks and value stocks, as both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently and could be big winners as interest rates fall. The Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF(NYSEMKT: VBR) lets me invest in both.\n\nThe short version is that small caps haven't traded for such a low price-to-book valuation relative to their large-cap counterparts in 25 years. And while the S&P 500 is close to an all-time high, most of its recent performance has been driven by growth stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), not by value stocks. To be clear, I'm buying this ETF to hold for the long haul, but now looks like a fantastic entry point.\n\nStory continues\n\nVanguard Real Estate ETF\n\nLast but certainly not least is the Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ). Real estate has been one of the worst-performing areas of the stock market over the past couple of years, as real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are highly sensitive to rising interest rates.\n\nBecause REITs are built for predictable income, their yields tend to move in the same direction as rates from risk-free investments like Treasury bonds. Since yield and price have an inverse relationship, higher yields tend to pressure REIT prices. In addition, REITs tend to rely on borrowed money to finance their operations, similar to how most people use mortgages to buy properties, and rising rates make borrowing more expensive. As rates normalize, real estate has a high probability of outperforming.\n\nWhat are the best ETFs for you?\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there are plenty of excellent ETFs you could add to your portfolio, and the right choices for you depend on your investment goals and risk tolerance. For example, someone who is a little closer to retirement than me might want to put more of their capital in income-based ETFs. But with that in mind, these are three excellent and low-cost choices that could be great ETFs to buy and hold for decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now and Hold For a Decade",
        "content": "It's difficult to overstate the impact artificial intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. While AI has been around in one form or another for decades, the latest developments have the potential to move the needle in ways we can't yet imagine.\n\nGenerative AI has demonstrated the ability to create original text, images, and audio, but its potential goes far beyond that. When properly trained, these systems can summarize and draft emails, create presentations, search for and compile data, and even draft and debug complicated computer code.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research has crunched the numbers, and its estimate is jaw-dropping. As AI works its way into business systems and society in general, it could be worth as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile there are bound to be many beneficiaries, one company well-positioned to reap its portion of this AI windfall is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA prescient pivot\n\nTo understand how the company got to where it is today, it's important to take a step back. Nvidia originally made its fortunes by pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that created lifelike images in video games, revolutionizing the industry.\n\nThe underlying technology that made this possible is parallel processing, which can process a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking big jobs into smaller, more manageable bits. Nvidia began to see the potential and quickly adapted this process to other applications.\n\nThe humble GPU has evolved far beyond video games. It now speeds data through the ether, processes information in data centers and cloud computing, and enables the latest advances in AI.\n\nNvidia's market opportunity is growing by leaps and bounds, increasing with each new use case. Early last year, management estimated the company's total addressable market at about $1 trillion -- and that was before the adoption of generative AI really kicked into high gear. This suggests that the number is even higher now.\n\nThe need for data centers that can harness the power of AI has caused a building boom that's only just begun. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi suggests that the AI server market will grow 75% annually over the next three years, calling the buildout \"unprecedented.\"\n\nThis robust demand is clear in Nvidia's results. In its fiscal 2024, revenue soared 126% year over year to $61 billion, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 marked a 586% surge. Nvidia's data center segment, which includes chips used for cloud computing and AI, was the star of the show -- generating record revenue of $18.4 billion, a 409% increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ends April 30, Nvidia is forecasting record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year. Management was clear that it was the rapid expansion of generative AI was driving the growth.\n\nJust last month, Nvidia unveiled its latest AI workhorse -- The Grace Blackwell GB200, which it called the \"world's most powerful chip\" for AI. It offers five times the performance of the H100 and cements Nvidia's technological lead in the space.\n\nGiven Nvidia's technology forms the foundation of AI processing, the company is fueling the AI revolution.\n\nCompeting from a place of strength\n\nOne of the biggest risks the bears cite is the coming competition, but Nvidia's relentless pace of innovation has kept its rivals at bay. The company has an estimated 95% share of the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, so Nvidia has a strong foothold.\n\nFurthermore, data center demand is expected to double by 2030, according to a report by commercial real estate advisory firm Newmark Group. Estimates suggest it took more than 10,000 Nvidia chips to train Chat-GPT in 2022, and newer versions will require even more. This illustrates why demand for Nvidia's gold-standard AI processing chips should remain high.\n\nNvidia is also the undisputed leader in machine learning, an earlier and well-established branch of AI. Nvidia controls roughly 95% of the market, according to data compiled by New Street Research.\n\nData centers are inextricably entwined with AI technology, and Nvidia has a commanding lead in both. While there's always the potential a rival could develop a more powerful or cost-effective AI solution, Nvidia's years of experience suggest it will be difficult to dislodge.\n\nYou get what you pay for\n\nAnother issue raised by Nvidia bears is the company's valuation. The stock is selling for 68 times earnings and 33 times sales (as of this writing), which will likely cause some investors to balk. However, the company's long track record of growth and future expectations should be considered. Nvidia stock is currently selling for 32 times forward earnings, only a slight premium to the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nDespite its recent pullback, Nvidia is still up nearly 200% over the past year and that's no anomaly. The stock has gained 1,600% over the past five years and 16,910% over the past 10 years.\n\nWhile investors shouldn't expect that level of gains over the coming decade, one thing is for sure: Nvidia is well-positioned to reap the ongoing windfall resulting from AI and represents a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could SoundHound AI Stock Become the Next Arm Holdings?",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) garnered a lot of attention after it was revealed that it was one of four stocks, along with Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) invested in late last year. Nvidia took some of its ample cash and invested in companies it thought could greatly benefit from the upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nNow there is a huge difference in size between SoundHound, which has a market cap of just over $1 billion, and Arm, which has a market cap of nearly $100 billion. Despite being just about one-hundredth of the size of Arm, SoundHound does share some intriguing similarities with the company.\n\nA royalty revenue model\n\nOne trait that helped lift Arm to where the company is today is its business model, which generates a lot of recurring revenue over long periods of time. The company licenses its technology to other companies getting upfront payments, but then collects royalties thereafter on every chip a customer ships based on its architecture. The model has proven to be so enduring that nearly half of Arm's royalty revenue comes from products that were introduced in 2012 or before.\n\nSoundHound also derives much of its revenue from royalties. In fact, over 94% of its revenue in 2023 came from product royalties. With SoundHound's model, customers incorporate its voice AI platform into their devices, such as automobiles, third-party assistants, or smart TVs. SoundHound then collects royalty payments based on volume, usage, or life of the applicable product.\n\nThe company has also started to sell its platform via subscriptions for use cases that don't have a product attached to it. SoundHound has done a good job making inroads with its technology into the restaurant industry. Since there is no product attached to its technology in this industry, it sells its service as a subscription. This is also another recurring revenue stream, which helps add predictability to its business.\n\nAI beneficiaries\n\nBoth Arm and SoundHound are also current beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Arm is seeing growth pick up as new end devices, such as smartphones, need more of its technology incorporated in central processing units (CPUs) to handle AI applications.\n\nSoundHound, meanwhile, has seen its backlog grow as AI has quickly gone from being accepted to becoming expected. Its technology helps voice assistants and humans interact more naturally, as well as allows for more complex questions and answers.\n\nThe automobile industry has been one of the driving forces in embracing its platform; the company has relationships with more than 20 auto brands. The restaurant industry is quickly following suit with the company signing deals with restaurant chains as well as restaurant-focused fintech companies such as Toast and Olo.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Soundhound and Arm have teamed up with Nvidia. Arm's technology is being used in Nvidia's Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines CPUs with GPUs to help handle AI workloads more quickly while using less power. SoundHound, meanwhile, partnered with Nvidia to develop an in-vehicle voice platform running on the Nvidia Drive platform that doesn't need internet connectivity. Among the use cases for this technology will be retrieving information directly from a vehicle's user manual. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is in its early stages\n\nSoundHound hasn't produced a lot of revenue yet, with the company reporting a 47% increase in revenue to $45.9 million for 2023. What it does have, though, is a large booking backlog of $661 million. These are signed contracts that if honored will turn into future revenue. The weighted average length of its contracts is about six and a half years, so that would average out to about $100 million in revenue per year just from currently signed contracts over that time. Some of this is back-end loaded, so don't expect $100 million in revenue next year, but it does set the company up for solid future revenue growth.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI becomes more incorporated into everyday lives, more automobile manufacturers will look to add SoundHound's platform into their vehicles and more industries will look to use its technology. The company will also continue to innovate and offer new products.\n\nThat sets SoundHound up for strong potential growth in the years ahead. Now will SoundHound grow to the heights of Arm? That's a difficult task, but it is possible. Arm was able to get its CPU architecture into nearly every smartphone made. If SoundHound's AI voice technology can be incorporated into most smartphones, it can follow a similar path.\n\nThat said, SoundHound doesn't need to be the next Arm for an investment in the stock to be successful. If the company can continue to get wins in the auto and restaurant spaces and then perhaps capture some of the higher-end smartphone market, it will have a lot of long-term upside from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nDespite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.\n\nApple Strikes Back with AI Plans\n\nFor example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will \"come back\" as the company is expected to provide more \"clarity\" and \"visibility\" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iOS 18.\n\nThe net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to \"warm up\" to the opportunity of Apple's \"AI upgrade cycle.\"\n\nA New AI-Focused ETF Craze\n\nRetail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.\n\nAI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says\n\nDespite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a \"forward-looking\" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the \"bar\" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities\n\nData center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.\n\nData center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:\n\n\"We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n\nWe are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n\nSupply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that’s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we’re executing reflect that yet.\n\nThere is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here. American Politicians are Buying These AI Stocks\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nIt's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an \"overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption.\" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought a stake in IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) shares have declined by 5%.\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.”\n\n9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nSemiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought shares of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN). The biggest stakeholder of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which had a $728 million stake in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company’s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.”\n\n8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 77\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) worth between $100,001 - $250,000 with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Given our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.\n\nEarlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares have gained about 5.4%.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\n\nOn January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.\n\nIn December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We trimmed our positions in Adobe and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nInsiders are Amassing These 10 Stocks in April 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer 10 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "title": "Nvidia Owns a 3.4% Stake in This Innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Cathie Wood Loves",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't just a leader in developing the key hardware fueling the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It's a big investor in other AI companies, often including an equity investment in its business relationships. In December, its portfolio of AI stocks surpassed the $100 million threshold, requiring it to file form 13-F with the SEC disclosing all of its holdings.\n\nNvidia's portfolio isn't very broad, containing just five stocks, and 97% of the portfolio is concentrated in just two holdings.\n\nThe biggest piece of Nvidia's portfolio is ARM Holdings, the chip architecture company the AI giant tried to purchase for $40 billion in 2020. It ended up grabbing a stake worth $190 million at its current price, representing just a small slice of the $100 billion company. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's second-largest holding represents a much more meaningful stake in an innovative AI company. This company has also found favor with Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, which bought more shares earlier this month, adding to its position as the company's largest shareholder. Importantly, investors can still invest in the stock near the same level Nvidia did last July. It's no wonder Wood and her team have been snapping up shares recently.\n\nNvidia's second-largest holding is a 3.4% stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX). The company is using AI to mine data and discover new potential drugs. And if it successfully develops a breakthrough medicine, it could easily turn into Nvidia's biggest investment.\n\nHarnessing AI to move faster and reduce costs\n\nRecursion is a biotech company that aims to improve the drug discovery process by using big data and AI. It combines public datasets and its own proprietary data to discover new potential compounds. It then uses its algorithms to filter its compounds into viable candidates for development to treat rare diseases or precisely target certain cancers.\n\nRecursion says that its process reduces the number of development candidates from its initial screen to less than 10% of what a traditional drug discovery company might. That allows it to focus only on options with the highest chance of success, enabling it to spend less and move faster.\n\nIt currently has five treatments in phase 2 clinical trials. Each one treats a patient population of less than 1 million, with most treating populations of less than 100,000. That means that if it succeeds in bringing one of these treatments to market, it will likely be the only competitor serving that population.\n\nIf Recursion can prove that its method is consistently more successful, faster, and more cost-effective than others in the industry, it presents a lot of opportunities. Not only can it continue to discover and develop new treatments, but it can also license its platform to other drugmakers working in more complex areas. That can provide up-front capital to expand its operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company already has partnerships in place with Roche and Bayer to help discover oncology targets and neuroscience therapies.\n\nShould you invest with Nvidia and Cathie Wood?\n\nInvesting in Recursion is a big bet on the company's process paying off in a viable drug.\n\nThe company currently generates revenue primarily through its collaborative agreements with other drugmakers. That generated a total of $44 million for the company last year, up from $40 million in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, it's burning through cash as it works to discover and develop drugs while building out its AI platform. R&D expenses climbed to $241 million last year, up from $156 million the year before. And total operating losses climbed to $350 million from $246 million.\n\nThe company ended last year with $392 million in cash on its balance sheet, which gives it some runway. But it will likely need to raise more cash soon to continue funding its operations. That'll likely come through equity investments, which could dilute shareholder's stakes.\n\nAll this makes Recursion a risky investment. The payoff could be huge, though. It's a relatively small company with a market capitalization of $1.85 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for the overall pharmaceutical industry, which generated around $1.6 trillion last year in sales.\n\nFor investors looking for a home run stock, you wouldn't have bad company investing in Recursion. Nvidia backs it along with several other members of the AI and pharma industries, and Cathie Wood has made it one of the biggest holdings in her genomics-focused ETF. But it's also possible you could swing and miss.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Recursion Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Recursion Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nEstablished in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation.\n\nBanks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment.\n\nDespite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected.\n\nCurious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.\n\nIt’s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients’ needs. And we’re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our roster of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we reviewed the bank's submissions to the SEC, pinpointing its 15 most substantial investment holdings. Our evaluation process also incorporates insights from Insider Monkey's repository of 933 hedge funds, as of the final quarter of 2023.

Here is what the firm commented:\n\n“Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.”\n\n6.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Owns 8 Stocks -- and This Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Isn't One of Them",
        "content": "Bill Ackman and his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital(OTC: PSHZ.F), are notable investors. Thanks to his frequent appearances on popular financial news networks and his coverage in other publications, the billionaire is a well-recognized investor. But some may be surprised to hear that his hedge fund only owns eight stocks -- and only seven companies.\n\nPershing Square Capital's current holdings look like this.\n\nCompany Percentage of Portfolio Chipotle Mexican Grill  18.3% Restaurant Brands International 17.6% Hilton Hotels 16.2% Howard Hughes Holding 15.1% Alphabet (class C shares) 12.8% Canadian Pacific Kansas City 11.5% Alphabet (class A shares) 5.9% Lowe's 2.7%\n\nData source: Whale Wisdom. Note: Percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding.\n\nSome investors might cringe at his portfolio's lack of diversification, but Ackman's strategy has worked out over the long term. Additionally, some might question its lack of artificial intelligence (AI) exposure, especially since he doesn't own Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe only real AI exposure in his portfolio is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which is still mainly an advertising firm right now.\n\nSo, why don't Ackman and Pershing Square Capital own Nvidia?\n\nNvidia doesn't fit with Ackman's No. 1 rule\n\nAny assessment of Ackman's style will clearly show he's a value investor, following the footsteps of perhaps the most famous investor of all time: Warren Buffett. His top qualification for determining whether he should buy a stock is if the business is \"simple and predictable.\"\n\nAny investor following Ackman's No. 1 rule would therefore refrain from buying most AI-related stocks, including Nvidia. However, Nvidia is fairly simple at its core. Its primary products, graphics processing units (GPUs), are computation hardware that can perform large volumes of calculations in parallel. This makes GPUs extremely well suited to handle computationally arduous tasks like displaying the complex and rapidly changing graphics of modern video games -- and training and running the latest generative AI models. At the end of the day, Nvidia's business model is simple: Sell more GPUs.\n\nUnfortunately for investors, the company's sales arc is far from predictable. Before the generative AI arms race that triggered Nvidia's latest sales boom, Nvidia was reeling from the crash of the cryptocurrency market. Its GPUs can also be used to mine Bitcoin and a few dozen other proof-of-work coins, so when the crypto winter hit in 2021, that source of demand dried up.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipmaking is a cyclical business, and demand for Nvidia's products will fall from time to time. This will include the demand for the types of GPUs that are currently being used to power AI models. Eventually, enough infrastructure will have been built that Nvidia won't need to produce quite as many GPUs. But when this will happen is anyone's guess, which makes the business unpredictable.\n\nHowever, that's about the only rule of Ackman's that Nvidia breaks.\n\nAckman's other preferences\n\nOn his checklist for potential investments, Ackman lists other factors. Among them, he likes companies that are dominant in their space, operate in businesses with high barriers to entry, produce high capital returns, and have excellent management. Those are all characteristics Nvidia displays, so why doesn't Ackman own its shares?\n\nBecause Ackman doesn't break his No. 1 rule. While an investor may at times bend a few of their other investing rules, one should never stray from the core principle of their portfolio. Ackman understands his investing style and he has done well with it, so for him, venturing into growth investing wouldn't be wise.\n\nIn sum, the reason why Ackman and Pershing Square do not own Nvidia is because it doesn't fit their style.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Who? 3 AI Plays Destined to Outshine the Industry Giant",
        "content": "Investors have been snookered by technology head fakes in the past. The metaverse was hardly the game-changing advance we were promised. Very few people, it turns out, actually want to be connected to their computers all day, every day to work, play and interact. The metaverse may hold some value but the exponential market opportunity analysts predicted seems way off the mark.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is different. Today, businesses are realizing tangible real-world benefits of utilizing AI. Speed bumps will emerge along the way, of course. Energy consumption is going to strain just how far the technology can go. Water for cooling systems will divert an already scarce resource from other equally vital needs. But unlike the metaverse, AI is the real deal.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the early stages of AI’s breakout. Its advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) chips were readily able to handle the complex and all-consuming nature of AI’s demands. But with more competition developing equally powerful chips, Nvidia stock may not be the winning play it once was.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three companies are AI stocks to outshine Nvidia in the next stage of the technology’s evolution and growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough best known as a smartphone chipmaker, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) flies under the radar of many investors as an AI stock. They might be surprised to learn Broadcom is actually the second-largest AI chipmaker by revenue behind Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker generated $4 billion in annual AI revenue last year but reported $2.3 billion in the first quarter, quadruple the year-ago figure. It estimates 35% of fiscal 2024 revenue will come from AI, or some $10 billion. Previously the chipmaker forecast a quarter of its revenue, or $8 billion, would be from AI but growth is accelerating.\n\nThe reason for the increase is data center demand from hyperscalers. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators are behind the designs of the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Also, it designed a custom chip for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At its investor day in March, Broadcom announced it signed on a third large cloud customer for its AI accelerators.\n\nLook for the chipmaker to readily surpass Nvidia in the near future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another surprising AI chipmaker that is on a path to outshine Nvidia. The chipmaker is looking for AI revenue to double this year and then keep doubling for several years thereafter. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a customer, and earlier this month announced it won another large customer for its AI chips. The one downside for Marvell Technology is that its custom chips carry lower gross margins than its off-the-shelf chip business.\n\nYet, custom chips will be a significant driver of future revenue growth. And Marvell Technology is looking to make up in volume what it loses in margins. For that reason, the chipmaker maintained its gross margin forecast when it reported earnings recently. Marvell says adjusted gross margins will be between 62% and 63% in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nWhere the chipmaker is expected to excel is in the electro-optical chips that sell into data centers and AI networks. With both channels anticipated to see significant expansion in the coming years, Marvell Technology will experience rapid growth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock that should outshine Nvidia in the future is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay, just about every chipmaker turns to TSM to make its chips – Nvidia included.\n\nWhen the chipmaker reported earnings the other day, it shook the market by implying a slowdown coming in the semiconductor market. However, it forecast its own business to keep growing with guidance of “low- to mid-20%” revenue growth. AI was the primary reason for it.\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei said the contract manufacturer was still experiencing a “surge in AI-related demand.” He termed it “insatiable.” It is yet another semiconductor stock expecting AI to cause revenue to “more than double this year.” TSM forecasts AI will represent a “low-teens” percentage of full-year sales.\n\nWith Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as top customers, so long as their respective AI business grows, you can be sure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will outshine them all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Members of Congress Are Scooping Up Shares of Its Core Rival Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the 800-pound gorilla of artificial intelligence (AI). Demand for its chips is through the roof. Its shares skyrocketed by 239% last year, and are up around 60% so far in 2024.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only AI company that's popular with investors, and there's another one that has especially found favor with those whom the voters have sent to work on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress are scooping up shares of Nvidia's chief rival instead.\n\nOut with Nvidia, in with AMD\n\nNvidia ranked in the top 10 among stocks lawmakers sold most in 2023. The trend has continued into this year, with sell transactions outweighing buy transactions by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIt's a completely different story with Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), though. Year to date, there have been 11 purchases of AMD shares reported by members of Congress versus only three sell transactions, according to Capitol Trades.\n\nThe buying has been bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas have each bought AMD shares multiple times in  2024.\n\nAMD's appeal\n\nMembers of Congress must disclose all trades they make, but they don't have to reveal why they buy and sell specific stocks. It's not too hard to figure out why some lawmakers find AMD appealing, though.\n\nAMD has lagged well behind Nvidia in the AI chip market thus far. However, it hopes to take some market share from its bigger rival -- and just might be successful in those efforts.\n\nIn December, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI accelerator and its Instinct MI300A accelerated processing unit. The company claimed the MI300X chip holds its own against Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit in training large language models. And AMD maintained its new chip beats the H100 GPU in AI inference (the process through which AI models derive conclusions from data).\n\nIn addition, earlier this month, AMD rolled out its Ryzen line of AI chips for desktops and laptops. It touted the new chips as \"the most advanced x86 processors for AI PCs.\" PC makers including HP and Lenovo are expected to introduce products this quarter featuring AMD's new chips.\n\nImportantly, AMD doesn't have to beat Nvidia in the AI chip market to be a huge winner. Demand for AI chips should be so great for years to come that a company playing second fiddle in that niche will still make beautiful music for investors.\n\nIs AMD a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia?\n\nMembers of Congress seem to prefer AMD to Nvidia these days. But are they right to feel that way? Is AMD a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia?\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth stocks are expensive based on one popular valuation metric: AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45.7, while Nvidia's forward earnings multiple is about 34.3. However, these metrics are only based on earnings estimates for the next year.\n\nThere's a good case to be made that AMD could grow faster than Nvidia over the next five years. Technology companies, especially the big ones, don't want to be overly dependent on one source for chips, and they have been with Nvidia when it comes to AI silicon. AMD could be an attractive alternative if it can provide comparable performance at a lower cost.\n\nNvidia may out-innovate AMD and hold onto its commanding market share lead. Right now, though, I'm on the same page as politicians on Capitol Hill who view AMD as the better stock to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 2 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks of 2024. They Could Soar Another 69% and 91%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts.",
        "content": "Two trendy artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have led the S&P 500 higher in 2024. When the market closed on April 24, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) had notched year-to-date gains of 61% and 166%, respectively, surpassing every other stock in the index. Even so, certain Wall Street analysts are forecasting substantial gains for shareholders over the next year.\n\nSpecifically, Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt recently raised his price target on Nvidia to $1,400 per share, implying 69% upside from the current price of $826 per share. Similarly, Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital recently raised his price target on Super Micro Computer to $1,500 per share, implying 91% upside from the current price of $787 per share.\n\nInvestors should never fixate on forecasts, especially forecasts that come from individual analysts, but Nvidia and Supermicro warrant further consideration.\n\nNvidia: a 61% year-to-date gain\n\nNvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware and software to speed up complex data center workloads like 3D simulations, visualizations, and artificial intelligence. Nvidia dominates the market for data center accelerators due to its invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 and its subsequent launch of the CUDA programming model in 2006.\n\nWhile GPUs were initially designed to accelerate graphics workloads, CUDA let developers unlock their parallel processing capabilities for other applications. Ultimately, that innovation led Nvidia to the top of the supercomputer accelerator market. According to analysts, the company accounted for 98% of data center GPU sales and 92% of generative AI processor sales last year.\n\nThe CUDA ecosystem has expanded over the years, so developers can now build all sorts of GPU-accelerated applications. Moreover, Nvidia now sells subscription software and cloud services built atop CUDA. For instance, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a software platform that streamlines AI application development across various use cases, from recommender systems in retail to route optimization in logistics to computer vision in robotics.\n\nNvidia reported stellar financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 265% to $22.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income soared 486% to $5.16 per diluted share. That momentum was driven by demand for data center products, especially those related to AI. Additionally, Nvidia said its nascent software and services business reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion, showing that the company is successfully diversifying beyond GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement guided for revenue growth of 190% in the first quarter. At the same time, the company expects non-GAAP operating expenses to climb just 56%, implying that earnings will once again increase much faster than revenue. That momentum is bound to slow at some point, but Nvidia is undoubtedly well positioned to monetize AI.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 69.3 times earnings look somewhat pricey; I doubt shareholders will see 69% upside over the next year. More importantly, while I think patient investors can purchase a very small position today, I would personally feel more comfortable buying shares if the PEG ratio -- currently at 1.98 (69.3 divided by 35) -- were closer to 1.5.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: a 166% year-to-date gain\n\nSuper Micro Computer develops and manufactures high-performance computing platforms comprising server, storage, and networking solutions. Its products incorporate technologies from suppliers like Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices, and they address various use cases across enterprise data centers and cloud data centers, including artificial intelligence.\n\nSupermicro is laser-focused on rapid development, such that it often beats peers to market with new products. To quote Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt, \"Supermicro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\" That advantage is helping Supermicro gain ground on competitors like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The company accounted for 10% of AI server sales last year, but that figure will reach 17% by 2026, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nSupermicro reported strong financial results in its fiscal second quarter (ended Dec. 31). Revenue increased 103% to $3.6 billion and non-GAAP net income jumped 71% to $5.59 per diluted share. Better yet, management expects revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to soar 205% and 244%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro cannot maintain triple-digit growth indefinitely, but the company is certainly well positioned to benefit as businesses spend more on AI. Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 50% annually over the next three to five years. In that context, the current valuation of 61.5 times earnings looks relatively reasonable, despite being a significant premium to the three-year average of 21.1 times earnings.\n\nPersonally, I doubt Supermicro stock will return 91% over the next 12 months, but I would be comfortable buying a small position today. However, before investors add shares to their portfolios, they should be aware of a near-term risk. Supermicro broke precedent earlier this month when it chose not to announce preliminary results for the third quarter. That sent the stock tumbling on April 19.\n\nIt's possible the official earnings report -- slated for release on April 30 -- contains some very disappointing news. Alternatively, management may have decided to skip preliminary results because the quarter went precisely as expected.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar 6,260%: My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) uses large language models and other machine learning models to create novel media content like text and speech, images and video, even computer code and gene sequences. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently called it \"the defining technology of our time.\"\n\nIndeed, automating content creation could improve productivity across numerous industries, so businesses are racing to realize the benefits. Bloomberg Intelligence says generative AI software sales could soar 6,260% to $318 billion by 2032, up from $5 billion in 2023. That puts investors in front of a massive opportunity.\n\nFor many, Nvidia may be the first stock that comes to mind. But I think little-known software company Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO) is the better buy right now. Here's why.\n\nNvidia: The early winner from the generative AI gold rush\n\nNvidia pioneered accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware and software to speed up demanding applications like artificial intelligence (AI). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard in AI infrastructure. \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMost investors see Nvidia as a chipmaker, but software expertise has played a significant role in its success. Nvidia GPUs initially faced competition from other parallel processors, but none survived because they lacked supporting software ecosystems, according to Kevin Krewell at Tirias Research.\n\nNvidia had more foresight. In 2006, its launch of programming model CUDA turned its GPUs (initially meant for computer graphics) into general purpose processors, and the company has continued to build out its software ecosystem since then.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of software frameworks and pretrained models that help businesses build a broad range of AI applications. The product suite includes Nvidia NeMo, a service that supports the development of custom generative AI models for language, vision, and speech applications. Better yet, Nvidia offers on-demand access to NeMo through DGX Cloud, a cloud service that pairs its AI Enterprise software with GPU-accelerated infrastructure to create a complete AI-as-a-service solution. Innovations like that should keep the company in growth mode for years to come.\n\nNvidia has already benefited from the generative AI gold rush -- the stock nearly tripled during the past year -- and it remains well positioned to benefit in the future. However, shares currently trade at 67 times earnings, a somewhat pricey valuation, given that Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next five years. For that reason, I think Docebo offers more upside for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDocebo: A little-known software company that could benefit from generative AI\n\nDocebo specializes in corporate learning management. Its platform lets businesses create, curate, deliver, and measure the impact of learning material across internal (employees) and external (customers) audiences. Docebo has earned a leadership position in the corporate learning management market through laser-focused innovation and differentiated products.\n\nFor instance, Docebo was among the first education technology companies to weave generative AI into its platform. Docebo Shape automates content creation by turning source material like documents, presentations, and case studies into learning content. The company plans to add more features this year, including a natural language interface that further simplifies content creation, and virtual role-play technology that provides personalized feedback in real time.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer recently selected Docebo as his \"top pick\" across education technology stocks, building on a previous report where he ranked Docebo as one of 11 software companies best positioned to monetize generative AI. \"Docebo is not only disrupting the internal learning management system (LMS) market, taking share from legacy vendors, but it is also leading the market in a greenfield external learning opportunity,\" he wrote.\n\nDocebo reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter. Its customer count climbed 11%, the average contract value increased 12%, and the average existing customer spent 4% more. In turn, revenue increased 27% to $46 million, and net income doubled to $0.10 per diluted share. Management highlighted momentum with larger customers during the quarter, as Docebo signed a top-four bank and expanded a deal with a top-five technology company.\n\nGoing forward, the learning management systems market is forecast to grow at 20% annually through 2030, but Docebo has consistently outpaced the industry in the past, and analysts think that trend will continue. Wall Street expects Docebo to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years, but I think that estimate leaves room for upside depending on how successfully the company monetizes Docebo Shape.\n\nIn any case, the current valuation of 8.4 times sales looks cheap. The market is overlooking this software stock, despite the company being well positioned to benefit from explosive growth in generative AI spending. Patient investors should seriously consider buying a position in Docebo today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Docebo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Docebo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Docebo wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Billionaires Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander Are Buying",
        "content": "Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander are some of the most successful investors in history.\n\nAll three are billionaires, and their respective hedge funds -- Renaissance Technologies, Bridgewater Associates, and Millennium Management -- have made thousands of investors rich along with them.\n\nIn investing, there are no bonus points for originality, so it pays to study the masters. In fact, thanks to the 13F filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter, you can invest alongside these billionaires as well.\n\nAccording to Motley Fool Research, these investors all own three of the same \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. Keep reading to see what they are and if these stocks are right for you. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's probably not a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) on this list. More than any other company, Nvidia has been the flag bearer of the AI boom as its sales and profits skyrocketed over the last year, propelling the stock past a $2 trillion market cap, and making it the third-most valuable company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, and the company has faced little competition thus far, though competition is coming.\n\nSimons, Dalio, and Englander all count Nvidia among their top holdings. At Renaissance Technologies, Nvidia is the second-largest tech holding, making up 1.2% of the portfolio, or $767.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nDalio's Bridgewater Associates, meanwhile, counts Nvidia as its third-largest tech holding with $133 million in Nvidia stock at the end of Q4. The fast-growing chip stock made up 0.7% of Bridgewater's portfolio.\n\nFinally, Nvidia makes up the fourth-largest tech holding in Englander's Millennium Management at 1% of the portfolio, or $1.02 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if these funds held, added to, or sold Nvidia in Q1, but we'll learn soon as 13F filings are due by mid-May. If they hold on to their Nvidia stakes, that move paid off as the stock jumped 82% in Q1.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is another top holding of these hedge funds, and like Nvidia, it's soared over the last year and a half. While Meta has benefited from the AI boom, the primary reason for its surge is a successful turnaround driven by cost cutting and a resurgence in its ad business that led to record profits.\n\nLooking ahead, the company still seems to have plenty of growth in front of it, especially with the new opportunity in AI, though some advertisers have recently complained that the company's ad manager has been unreliable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Renaissance, Meta represents the fund's fourth-largest holding in the tech sector with $744 million worth of Meta stock. Meta makes up 1.2% of the fund's value.\n\nRay Dalio's Bridgewater, meanwhile, is even more bullish on Meta as the social media giant makes up 1.3% of its portfolio as its second-biggest tech holding. The fund finished Q4 with $235.8 million worth of Meta stock.\n\nLastly, Millennium held $719.7 million in Meta stock as of the end of Q4, or 0.7% of the portfolio. That made it its fifth-largest tech holding.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nFinally, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has long been a top stock among hedge funds as the Google parent's competitive advantages are manifest with its dominant search engine, properties like YouTube, and promising \"moonshot\" businesses like its Waymo autonomous vehicle unit, and its AI investments like Google Brain and DeepMind.\n\nAlphabet hasn't had the kind of blowout performance over the past year that Nvidia and Meta have, but it's still outperformed the S&P 500 and recently touched an all-time high. Given its history of reliable growth and wide economic moat, it's not surprising that Alphabet is also a top pick among these three funds.\n\nAt Renaissance, Alphabet was its sixth-largest tech holding, worth $487.2 million, or 0.8% of the total portfolio.\n\nBridgewater was more bullish on Alphabet than any other tech stock, counting it as its top-tech holding at 1.6% of the total portfolio. As of the end of Q4, Bridgewater owned $285.6 million worth of Alphabet stock.\n\nMillennium also counts Alphabet as a top holding as the Google owner's stock makes up 1.8%, or $1.56 billion. Only Microsoft is a larger tech holding at Englander's fund.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nHedge fund ownership isn't a guarantee of outperformance, but it's worth tracking the moves of the biggest investors, especially if their holdings are similar to yours.\n\nKeep your eye on these stocks come mid-May as they could move once we learn which funds bought and sold them in Q1. Nonetheless, I'd expect them to remain top holdings among the biggest hedge funds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 10 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Selling. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Selling.\n\nThere was a time Cathie Wood talked about her famous \"five-year investment horizon\" with confidence, giving investors hope that the high-growth, cash-burning companies she was betting on would pay off in the future. But those profits remain elusive as the innovation-focused investor's funds bleed assets and experience brutal exodus of investors.  Cathie Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is down about 12% so far this year through April 26, compared to S&P 500's 7% gain in the same period.\n\nARK Funds See Funds Exodus as Investors Begin to Get \"Frustrated\"\n\nOnce a Wall Street darling that saw total assets under management swell to as much as $60 billion in February 2021, Ark Investment Management ETFs continue to see massive investor exodus as uncertainty about the future, dimming chances of rate cuts and an overall market shift towards safer, defensive stocks keep crushing risk appetite of retail as well as institutional investors. Data from FactSet shows that ARK Investment Management bled a whopping $2.2 billion from its six actively managed ETFs this year. Total funds under management at these ETFs declined by 30% in less than four months to $11.1 billion, according to FactSet data cited by Wall Street Journal. The report also quoted Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at industry data and analytics company VettaFi, who said even loyal customers of ARK funds are getting \"frustrated\" since 2024 should have been a better year for them given ARK's huge emphasis on growth and innovation.\n\nARK's Paradox: Losses in an Era of High Innovation\n\nFor years, Cathie Wood repeatedly talked about innovation, growth, technology disruption and how futuristic technology is set to change everything in human societies. Amid the AI revolution, companies and investors left and right started making top dollar by investing in companies working on the AI frontiers including Nvidia. But according to many, ARK's burgeoning losses explains its paradox: it is probably invested in the wrong companies. It missed out on Nvidia. It's heavily invested in Tesla (down 31% YTD) which is getting clobbered amid rising competition in the US and China (Cathie Wood reiterated her $2000 price target on TSLA recently). Half of ARK's innovation fund is invested in just seven stocks. Roku and UiPath, which are part of ARK Investment Management's top five holdings, are down 35% and 18% year to date through April 26, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nARK Fintech Innovation ETF Also Suffers Losses\n\nLosses aren’t limited to the innovation fund. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF failed to see any net inflows this year on any single day, according to a Bloomberg report, with its total assets under management falling below $1 billion. Some of the top holdings of the fund are Coinbase, Block and Shopify.\n\nCathie Wood Warns \"Reality Check\" Is Coming for AI Investors\n\nCathie Wood went all-in on genetics, 3D printing, biotechnology, self-driving and electric cars over the past few years. However, when it comes to AI, she seems too cautious and keeps warning investors of valuations. In her March 2024 letter to investors, Cathie Wood said investors enthusiastic about AI could get a \"reality check\" soon, as she expects future events to \"separate winners from losers in the years ahead.\" She drew an analogy between Nvidia of today and Cisco of 1994 which saw huge stock gains on the back of the market's belief that the company would see huge demand for its products amid internet penetration. However, the stock suffered huge losses as investors came to terms with realities.\n\n\"Today, Nvidia is guiding expectations to a sequential deceleration in growth and, reportedly, the lead time for its GPUs has dropped from 8-11 months to 3-4 months, suggesting that supply is increasing relative to demand. Without an explosion in software revenue to justify the overbuilding of GPU capacity, we would not be surprised to see a pause in spending, compounding a correction in excess inventories, particularly among the cloud customers that account for more than half of Nvidia’s data center sales. Longer term, unlike the history with Cisco, competition could intensify, not only because AMD is finding success but also because Nvidia’s customers—cloud service providers and companies like Tesla—are designing their own AI chips. That said, since 2019 futurists have collapsed the time to AGI[10] (Artificial General Intelligence) from 80 years to 8 years, so anything is possible,\" Cathie Wood wrote. 10 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Selling\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Investment Management\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we wanted to see which stocks in Cathie Wood's portfolio are seeing insider selling activity from corporate officers, executives and directors. For that we scanned Cathie Wood's Q1'2024 portfolio and picked 10 stocks that saw insider selling over the past few months.  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. The portfolio returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. Accolade Inc (NASDAQ:ACCD)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $58,824,690\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nHealthcare technology solutions company Accolade Inc (NASDAQ:ACCD) is one of the stocks in Cathie Wood portfolio that saw insider selling this year. Accolade Inc's (NASDAQ:ACCD) CEO Rajeev Singh on April 18 sold 355 shares of Accolade Inc (NASDAQ:ACCD) at $8.82 per share.  On the same day Accolade Inc's (NASDAQ:ACCD) President Robert N. Cavanaugh, the President sold 141 shares of Accolade Inc (NASDAQ:ACCD) at $8.82 per share. Accolade Inc (NASDAQ:ACCD) also saw insider selling activity from its Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel earlier this month.\n\nLike ACCD, Cathie Wood is also holding onto Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) and UiPath Inc (NYSE:PATH).\n\n9. Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $84,686,883\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nPete Large, Senior Vice President of Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), sold 1,447 shares of Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) at $59.10 per share on April 16. Since then Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) stock is up 1.3%.\n\nOut of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 29 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB).\n\n8. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $22,915,320\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nCathie Wood owns a $23 million stake in Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG) as of the end of the first quarter of 2024. The stock recently saw insider selling activity when Scott Dietzen, a director at Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), on April 4 dumped 272,541 shares at $53.33 per share. Since then the stock is down 1.5%. In addition to PSTG, Cathie Wood also likes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) and UiPath Inc (NYSE:PATH).\n\n7. Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $29,485,220\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nClinical genetic testing solutions company Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA) is one of the rewarding investments of Cathie Wood as the stock is up 47% year to date through April 23. However, the stock saw insider selling on March 5 when Jonathan Sheena, the Co-founder of Natera Inc (NASDAQ:NTRA), sold 6,028 shares at a price of $88.64 per share. Since this transaction the stock is up 4%.\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Natera, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTRA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Solid stock selection in life sciences tools & services was mainly due to double-digit gains from clinical genetic testing company Natera, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTRA) and global contract research organization ICON Plc. Natera’s stock was bolstered by significant momentum in the oncology market, where its personalized blood-based DNA test Signatera is driving strong testing volume growth. The test detects and quantifies how much residual cancer DNA remains in the body after surgery. Signatera helps physicians determine whether chemotherapy is necessary after surgery and monitor for cancer recurrence before the cancer is detectable with standard imaging. We think Natera has a long runway for growth with expanding margins and profitability.”\n\n6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $38,090,985\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nCloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET) ranks sixth in our list of the Cathie Wood stocks seeing insider selling activity. On February 15, 2024, Cloudflare Inc's (NYSE:NET) President and COO Michelle Zatlyn sold 461,540 shares of the Cloud computing company at $100.27 per share. Since then through April 23 Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET) shares have lost about 14% in value.\n\nIn addition to NET, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) and UiPath Inc (NYSE:PATH) are also important names in Cathie Wood's portfolio.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Selling.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nInsiders are Amassing These 10 Stocks in April 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Cathie Wood Stocks Insiders are Sellingwas initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech’s Biggest Comeback? 3 Stocks to Buy for the Epic Rebound.",
        "content": "A lot of technology stocks are battered and bruised. Many once high-flying mega-cap tech stocks are taking it on the chin. This week, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are down more than 10% after the tech giant issued disappointing guidance and mounting losses at its new ventures unit, Reality Labs. With interest rates expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, tech stocks seem particularly vulnerable to a downturn right now.\n\nIn recent weeks, entire subsectors of tech have moved lower, notably stocks of companies working in the areas of semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. How long the current downturn lasts is anyone’s guess. That said, there are some tech stocks that are showing tentative signs of recovery and could be poised for a turnaround in coming months, driven by earnings and other catalysts. Here are three tech stocks to buy in anticipation of an epic rebound.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is by no means out of the woods. The electric vehicle maker just reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and its first-quarter profit plunged 55% from a year earlier. That said, the worst of the selloff in TSLA stock appears to be over. In the two days since the company’s Q1 print, Tesla’s share price has risen 13%. The stock now looks to have bottomed at $138. Investors looking to bottom fish Tesla might want to buy the stock now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA lot is riding on the company’s ability to bring a more affordable electric vehicle to market by early 2025, as CEO Elon Musk promised during the Q1 earnings call with analysts and media. Cost controls and plans to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce will also be important, as is the ability to license its driver assistance system to other automakers. If Musk and his management team can pull it all off, then Tesla could prove to be one great comeback story. In the meantime, TSLA stock is trending upwards.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been a long-term laggard. In the last five years, TXN stock has risen 50%. Compare that to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 1,817% gain over the same period. While disappointing, Texas Instruments looks like it might be starting to get its mojo back after years of chronic underperformance. The company’s share price rose 7% in a day after the legacy tech concern reported better-than-expected financial results for Q1 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20, which was much better than Wall Street forecasts of $1.07. Revenue during the first three months of the year came in at $3.66 billion, also ahead of analyst estimates of $3.6 billion. In terms of guidance, Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The Q2 guidance aligns with Wall Street forecasts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might not be long before consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stages an epic rebound. In 2024, AAPL stock is one of the worst performers among tech securities. So far this year, Apple’s share price is down nearly 9%, and a laggard in the benchmark S&P 500 index. However, there are potential catalysts looming on the horizon. All eyes will be on the company’s May 2 earnings report. People will also be watching a May 7 event where Apple is expected to unveil a revamped version of its iPad tablet.\n\nApple’s signature tablet, the iPad, launched in 2010 and has not been significantly updated since 2018. A new iPad could help to boost sales of the device, which declined 25% to $7.02 billion in this year’s first quarter, according to industry estimates. Sales across all Apple products have suffered amid economic uncertainty and as consumers cutback on spending. Revitalizing its electronic devices could boost sales and AAPL stock. Unveiling AI applications at its developers conference in June could also help.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Nvidia Shares Go on a $290 Billion Tear as Clients Splurge on AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares are rallying back from last week’s selloff as some of the chip giant’s biggest clients are doubling down on artificial intelligence investments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Fed’s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock is up 15% this week, adding more than $260 billion in market capitalization and putting it on pace for its best weekly performance since last May. The surge comes after firms like Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. pledged billions in AI investments.\n\n“The future is AI,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares. “And if the largest companies in the world are pouring tens of billions of dollars each into this, I think Nvidia has to be the big winner.”\n\nThe move is a sharp reversal from last Friday’s 10% plunge, the shares’ worst day in more than four years, which came amid fears that enthusiasm for chipmakers had run too far too fast after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. scaled back its expansion outlook.\n\nNvidia currently dominates the lucrative market for accelerators that power data centers running complex computing tasks required for AI development. But the entire semiconductor industry is climbing, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, also known as the SOX, up 9.7% this week, compared with a 2.8% gain in the broader S&P 500 Index and a 4% jump in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nFirst-quarter reports “from key US hyperscalers - Google, Microsoft and Meta - suggest meaningful upside to CY24 capex, mostly driven by buildout of AI infrastructure,” Bank of America Corp. analysts lead by Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients on April 25.\n\nMeta shares were pressured on Thursday, tumbling 11%, after the Facebook-parent revealed that it will spend billions of dollars more than expected on AI this year. But Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet were able to convince investors that spending on AI was already paying off.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com Inc., another big Nvidia customer, is slated to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.\n\n“I hate to say things are a no-brainer,” Marino said. “But if you take a look at all the budget lines and all the capex spending, where is that going? It’s got to go to Nvidia, they have the best chips.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Intel CEO confident in its AI future after posting soft guidance",
        "content": "After several steps forward with investors, it's a few steps back for Intel (INTC).\n\nShares of the chipmaker fell 8% on Friday, following several hiccups in its first quarter results and second quarter guidance. While the company's first quarter earnings managed to surpass forecasts by $0.05, its guidance for the rest of the year came below consensus.\n\n\"We have a lot of great things happening in the second half of the year. We feel very comfortable with the outlook we have,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe selling pressure on Intel's stock stems from two areas.\n\nFirst, results for the quarter were constrained by a wafer supply issue that Wall Street failed to properly model.\n\nAnd second, there was some demand softness from customers — which is causing Intel execs to be on the cautious side for the second quarter guidance.\n\nIntel expects second quarter sales of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion. Earnings are projected at $0.10 per share, short of analyst forecasts for $0.24.\n\n\"We believe Intel has a difficult road ahead as the company begins a multi-year transition phase which involves high capital intensity and an ambitious design roadmap with expectations to move through five process node transitions in four years,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note.\n\nRoy maintained a Hold rating on Intel's stock.\n\nThe company's tepid guidance overshadowed a couple of wins in the quarter and in the past two months.\n\nGelsinger noted Intel expects to see more than 40 million shipments of AI PCs in 2024, a slight upgrade from his prior outlook. All of the company's planned chip launches for the year remain on track, Gelsinger added.\n\nIntel recently showcased a range of AI-focused products and services. On display was Gaudi 3, an AI chip for generative AI software that will become available later this year.\n\nThe company has also unveiled its Core Ultra processor, which will target the aforementioned emerging AI PC market. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, holding the \"Gaudi 3\" AI chip, speaks during the 54th Annual Meeting of The Semafor 2024 World Economy Summit in Washington, D.C., on April 17, 2024. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)\n\nAnd it was just last month that Intel won $8.5 billion in grants and another $11 billion in loans from the Biden administration to build semiconductor plants in four states. The build-outs are part of Intel's goal to become a leading maker of chips for other companies, rivaling No. 1 player Taiwan Semiconductors (TSMC).\n\nSaid JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur, \"Although we continue to be impressed by the current execution, the next 12 months will be the most difficult for the team as they will be launching two data center products and two major client products over three new manufacturing technology nodes — however, we believe it will serve as a strong proxy on the team’s ability to execute over the next 3-5 years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe vibe around tech stocks\n\nIntel's below-consensus earnings and tepid outlook arrive as the threat of higher for longer interest rates weighs on once-hot tech stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Building out AI infrastructure can also be more costly than expected, as articulated on first quarter earnings call from Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nSo what's the next move in tech stocks?

Samsung started supplying samples to customers in February. The deal is worth about $3 billion (KRW 4.134 trillion), Viva 100 reports.\n\nAlso Read: Micron Dominates High-Bandwidth Memory Market, Anticipates Significant Revenue Growth: Analyst\n\nIn exchange, Samsung Electronics will purchase AMD graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe supply will likely start in the second half of the year, aligning with AMD’s plans to begin mass production of chips then. AMD, initially planning to release the MI350 in the second half of this year and start mass production next year, has moved the release to the second quarter.\n\nTrend Force reports that the MI350’s bandwidth has increased by over 30% compared to its predecessor, the MI300. Although AMD’s chips have been recognized as having greater capacity than similar-class Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips, they were seen as inferior in bandwidth. To counter this, AMD has chosen to use HBM3E, specifically designed to enhance bandwidth.\n\nThis contract will likely be separate from Samsung Foundry operations.\n\nMeanwhile, SK Hynix has been Nvidia’s primary HBM supplier and leads the market. In April, SK Hynix announced plans to invest $3.9 billion in an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, focusing on mass-producing HBM.\n\nRecently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang endorsed Samsung Electronics’ HBM3E, signaling a potentially more collaborative relationship in the future.\n\nPrice Actions: AMD shares traded higher by 0.07% at $153.86 at the last check Friday.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead AI Charge: BofA Analyst Tips AMD, Micron as Emerging Contenders in Explosive Market Growth\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Pierre Lecourt via Flickr\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article AMD and Samsung Partner To Boos MI350 Chip Capabilities with Advanced Memory Tech originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "7 Undiscovered Stocks to Buy Before They Go Ballistic",
        "content": "There is an ocean of listed stocks and its impossible for an investor to have all quality names in the portfolio. Often, there are fundamentally strong stores that are under-the-radar. When these undiscovered stocks come to the limelight, the upside is sharp and multi-fold. The focus of this column is on stocks that represent companies that are largely unnoticed or ignored by investors.\n\nIn recent times, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was among the hottest stocks. Investors continued to buy the stock on the fear of missing out on a bigger rally. After trading at highs of $974, NVDA stock has corrected to current levels of $800. I am not suggesting that the stock will not trend higher again. However, investors who bought near 52-week highs would be sitting on significant losses.\n\nThe key lesson is to buy ideas when it’s sideways or lower. Not when the ideas are in the limelight and already overvalued. Undiscovered stocks provide that valuation comfort. Additionally, when the upside comes, the rally is likely to be significant.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s discuss seven undiscovered stocks to buy before they skyrocket.\n\nAlamos Gold (AGI) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlamos Gold (NYSE:AGI) is among the undiscovered stocks to buy for multibagger returns. Gold has been trending higher on rate cut expectations and heightened geopolitical tensions. I expect the trend for the precious metal to remain positive. Alamos Gold, as a quality gold miner, is well positioned to benefit from higher realized gold prices.\n\nBesides being bullish on gold, there are other reasons to be positive on Alamos. The Company has high-quality gold assets with an average mine life of Canadian operations at 18 years. Alamos has continued to expand its assets through acquisition with the most recent being Argonaut Goldfor a consideration of $276 million.\n\nFor 2024, Alamos has guided for production of 505,000 ounces of gold. The Company has a long-term production potential of 800,000 ounces of gold. With steady production upside coupled with higher realized prices, the Company is likely to deliver robust cash flows.\n\nIt’s also worth adding here that for the year, Alamos expects all-in-sustaining-cost of $1,150 an ounce. By 2026, the Company has guided for AISC of $1,050 an ounce. With a declining cost profile, EBITDA margin expansion will sustain even if gold remains sideways.\n\nGenpact Limited (G) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGenpact (NYSE:G) is another under-the-radar stock that deserves attention. G stock has trended lower by 28% in the last 12 months and trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.6. Valuations look attractive for this 1.93% dividend yield stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs an overview, Genpact is a professional services firm with presence in more than 30 countries. The Company’s Data-Tech-AI services are utilized by industries that include banking, healthcare, insurance, consumer goods, among others. For 2023, Genpact reported revenue of $4.48 billion.\n\nWith artificial intelligence being applied across industries for efficiency and cost saving, Genpact is well positioned to accelerate growth. The Company is a provider of AI services (including generative AI). Further, Genpact has also been assisting clients globally in providing automation assistance services.\n\nTherefore, with presence in key technology areas, Genpact is positioned for value creation. I must add that the business is a cash flow machine. Genpact has been creating value for investors through healthy dividend growth and share repurchase.\n\nAker BP ASA (AKRBF) Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up. Penny Oil Stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAker BP ASA (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) stock remains undiscovered largely due to the fact that it trades on the OTC exchange. I can say with some conviction that Aker BP can be a multibagger in the coming years. As an overview, Aker BP is an oil & gas exploration company with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\nAKRBF stock has been largely sideways in the last 12 months. The reason is weakness in oil prices on the back of macroeconomic headwinds. This consolidation is a good opportunity to accumulate the undervalued stock offering an attractive dividend yield of 9%.\n\nAs of 2023, Aker BP reported 2P reserves of 1.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, the Company had 810 million BOE in 2C resources. It’s worth noting that the Company’s assets have a low break-even. The entire portfolio break-even is estimated at $35 to $40 per barrel. Therefore, even with oil at $80 per barrel, Aker BP is positioned to deliver robust cash flows.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Aker reported revenue and EBITDA of $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion respectively for Q1 2024. For the same period, the Company’s operating cash flow was $1.5 billion.\n\nNomad Foods (NOMD) NOMD stock: Nomad Foods braded products featured in a store\n\nSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nNomad Foods (NYSE:NOMD) stock has traded sideways for the last 12 months. This is s good accumulation opportunity with NOMD stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.8. I would not be surprised if the stock doubles in the next 24 months. Further, NOMD stock offers a dividend yield of 0.8%.\n\nAs an overview, Nomad Foods is Western Europe’s leading frozen food company. For 2023, Nomad Foods reported revenue growth of 4.9% on a year-on-year basis to 3 billion euros. For the same period, the Company reported adjusted EBITDA of 535 million euros. At the same time, adjusted free cash flow was 300 million euros. With robust cash flows, Nomad Foods initiated dividends in 2023.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Nomad Foods is targeting long-term revenue growth of 3% to 4%. Further, adjusted EBITDA growth is likely in the range of 5% to 7%. With 90% to 95% adjusted free cash flow conversion, it’s likely that dividend growth will be robust in the coming years. This will translate into stock re-rating.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS) Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a \"BUY NOW!\" button on a laptop keyboard. stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLeonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) stock has been in an uptrend. However, the emerging name from the defense sector remains largely unnoticed. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.8, DRS stock is attractive for fresh exposure.\n\nIt’s worth noting that global defense spending surged by 6.8% on a year-on-year basis to $2.44 trillion. This does not come as a surprise as global geopolitical tensions escalate. I expect defense spending to continue increasing and Leonardo DRS is well positioned to benefit.\n\nLeonardo DRS is a provider of defense products and technologies. The Company’s focus is on areas of advance sensing, network computing, force protection, electric power & propulsion. For the last financial year, the Company reported revenue and EBITDA of $2.8 billion and $324 million respectively.\n\nIt’s worth noting that since listing in November 2022, the Company’s order backlog has swelled by 2.5x to $7.8 billion. With increasing defense spending, I expect the order intake to remain robust. This will translate into accelerated revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nAdecoagro (AGRO)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith uncertain weather conditions and global food shortage, agriculture stocks are likely to be in focus. Adecoagro (NYSE:AGRO) has not been in the limelight, but it’s not long before the stock gets the attention it deserves.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in the last 12 months, AGRO stock has gradually trended higher by 36%. However, valuations remain attractive with the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.9. AGRO stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.94% and I expect steady dividend growth in the coming years.\n\nAdecoagro is in the business of farming, land transformation, sugar, ethanol, and energy. In the farming segment, the Company’s focus is on rice and other agricultural products. I must mention here that the valuation of the Company’s farmland was $745 million as of September 2023.\n\nFor Q4 2023, Adecoagro reported gross sales of $400 million, which was higher by 4.7% on a year-on-year basis. For the same period, the adjusted EBITDA was $95.8 million. With rising agricultural commodity prices, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will be in an uptrend. This will boost cash flows and the dividend outlook.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is another interesting pick in the list of undiscovered stocks. The stock has been trending lower in the last few quarters on the back of weakness in energy prices. However, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 8, BORR stock looks attractive. It’s worth noting that the stock also offers a dividend yield of 1.75%.\n\nAs an overview, Borr Drilling is a provider of offshore drilling services through its fleet of jack-up rigs. As of Q4 2023, Borr reported an order backlog of $1.75 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. With potential rate cuts due in 2024, I expect oil to trend higher. This will ensure that the order intake remains robust.\n\nLast year, Borr Drilling reported adjusted EBITDA of $351 million. With a strong order backlog, the Company has guided for EBITDA of $525 million for 2024. With sharp increase in EBITDA, cash flows are also likely to swell. The growth trajectory clearly indicates that BORR stock is undervalued.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is deepening its involvement with China while expanding its production in Southeast Asia and India, illustrating the iPhone maker’s delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs.\n\nIn 2023, Apple increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its reliance on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, according to a Nikkei Asia review of Apple’s latest official supplier list.\n\nApple publishes an official list of its suppliers nearly every year. The most recent list includes 187 companies, accounting for 98% of the company’s procurement for fiscal 2023.\n\nSince 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple’s supplier network, growing to 52 in the last year from 48 in 2022. The number of manufacturing or development facilities in China, including those owned by domestic and foreign companies, increased by 10 to 286.\n\nAs Apple accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to deepen.\n\nThe number of Apple suppliers in Vietnam surged by 40% to 35 last year, while the number in Thailand increased by about a third to 24. The number of suppliers in India remained stable at 14.\n\nHowever, this growing presence in India and Southeast Asia does not necessarily mean a reduced dependence on China.\n\nPrior reports conjectured that Apple reduced its dependence on China due to growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China after which Washington imposed a semiconductor technology embargo on China which included import of sophisticated AI chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other chip designers.\n\nNikkei Asia’s analysis indicates that approximately 37% of the 35 suppliers in Vietnam are from China and Hong Kong, including AirPods assemblers Luxshare and Goertek and iPad assembler BYD.\n\nAll three have increased their production capacity in the country to serve Apple.\n\nTaiwanese suppliers remain the second-largest group in the Apple supply chain, followed by U.S., Japanese, and South Korean suppliers.\n\nA significant portion of its supply chain is in China, and revenue from Greater China — the world’s largest consumer electronics market — still accounted for 17% of its total revenue in the December quarter.\n\nAccording to IDC data, Apple’s shipments in the first quarter of this year dropped nearly 10% globally, a steeper year-over-year decline than peers like Samsung and Xiaomi experienced.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior reports indicated that Apple is offering the iPhone 15 series at steep discounts in China through resellers, implying softening demand.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring anticipates a slight revenue increase for the March quarter.\n\nStill, he expects a significant downward revision for the June quarter guidance compared to consensus, which may initially disappoint the market.\n\nDespite this, he sees potential for a relief rally at Apple, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) expected to showcase new AI software features.\n\nWoodring notes the possibility of a nearly 30% upside to his new price target and a pivotal AI-driven iPhone cycle in fiscal 2025, focusing on total revenue, China iPhone shipments, and Services revenue growth in his analysis.\n\nApple stock gained 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).\n\nPrice Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.39% at $170.55 premarket at the last check Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage Source – Apple\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Will Solid AWS Momentum Aid Amazon's (AMZN) Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to have continued gaining from the solid momentum in the rapidly growing cloud market on the back of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nWe note that the growing popularity and the strong adoption of AWS have been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business. The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS’s revenues were $24.2 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, accounting for 14% of net sales, rising 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base, owing to a robust AWS portfolio, is likely to have driven AWS’s top line in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 AWS net sales is pegged at $24.26 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to find out how the company’s overall first-quarter performance is expected to have been.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nThe company’s expanding AWS portfolio is expected to have benefited the first-quarter performance of the underlined segment. Growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities are likely to have been other positives.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, AWS extended its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology via the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.\r\n\r\nAWS’s partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage remains noteworthy. As part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nExpanding portfolio offerings are expected to have driven AWS’s customer momentum in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nDeutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) extended its multi-year partnership with AWS to drive innovation across Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2. As part of this, AWS has become the official generative AI provider for DFL and has been the official technology provider for the latter.\r\n\r\nNTT DOCOMO also selected AWS, and intends to leverage the latter’s robust infrastructure and cloud services to deploy its nationwide 5G Open Radio Access Network in Japan.\r\n\r\nOwkin selected AWS as the primary cloud provider. Owkin intends to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials with the help of AWS’s scalable storage options, enhanced data security measures and strong computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nA strong customer base is expected to have continued to help Amazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), to boost its competitive position in the cloud computing market against Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, which have been making concerted efforts to bolster their cloud market share.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. Azure's globally increasing number of availability zones and regions, along with strength in Azure AI and growing generative AI capabilities, remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions, and solid momentum in generative AI have been positives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Top 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "Everyone knows today’s top semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which often attract the bulk of investor attention and capital.\n\nHowever, lesser-known top semiconductor stocks are lurking in the market, ready to skyrocket as artificial intelligence and machine learning tech evolve and trends accelerate. To find these overlooked semiconductor stocks, keep two criteria in mind. First, identify top semiconductor companies specializing in niche components critical to specific applications, such as parts for electric vehicle assemblies. These firms often dominate their market niches and maintain strong positions.\n\nFor other top semiconductor stocks, look to those supporting the wider industry and not directly competing with the likes of Nvidia or AMD — find semiconductor stocks providing key peripheral services to those companies, and you’ll find semiconductor stocks set to explode no matter which specific company dominates the industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInfineon (IFNNY) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInfineon’s (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) top semiconductor stock status lays at the intersection of multiple emerging automotive trends: EVs and increasingly complex internal “dashboard tech” in cars of all types. The European semiconductor manufacturer embeds its components in various vehicle systems, including infotainment platforms and Bluetooth interfaces.\n\nFurthermore, Infineon’s chips are essential to less visible — but key — EV functions like anti-lock braking systems, airbag deployment mechanisms and air conditioning. As EVs continue to advance into lower-end market segments due to decreasing research and development costs, the demand for these semiconductors is set to surge. Infineon stands out as one of the key players poised to benefit from this increasing demand.\n\nLikewise, the outlook for EV infotainment systems is particularly promising. A research report projects a 38% annual growth in demand for these systems through 2030. As vehicle interiors become more complex, the need for semiconductors intensifies. Infineon’s strategic position in this specific area of the EV value chain distinguishes it from other semiconductor manufacturers offering more general-purpose solutions.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a niche semiconductor stock that’s a top operator in the 5G and wireless data sector. It provides essential semiconductors for the wireless ecosystem in cell towers and individual user phones. Skyworks’ specific benefits lay in globally expanding 5G network connectivity, as its components are crucial for band switching and other functionalities associated with 5G.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Skyworks enjoys a broad market opportunity, it is significantly reliant on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for nearly 60% of its 2022 revenue. Although such dependence on a single customer poses risks, the burgeoning 5G market, expected to grow at an annual rate of 32% through 2030, gives Skyworks a decent safety net backstop.\n\nInstitutional investors, who own 84% of Skyworks shares, reinforce the stock’s strength. Following the smart money — large institutional investors — is often a wise strategy for niche tech like semiconductor stocks. With 19 institutions holding more than half of the company’s shares, their substantial commitment signals a strong belief in Skyworks’ potential, suggesting something uniquely compelling about this semiconductor stock.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell. Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is a top semiconductor support stock rather than a chipmaker, but it is indispensable to the industry and still benefits from wider sector trends. Its year-to-date 26% climb signals strong momentum, but that’s just part of the company’s growth trajectory.\n\nIn August last year, Onto announced a significant $100 million deal for its Dragonfly inspection system. This system is crucial for detecting flaws in semiconductors made by third parties, addressing a vital need for major companies like Nvidia.

        "title": "Micron (MU) Secures $6.1B for Domestic Manufacturing Expansion",
        "content": "Micron Technology, Inc. MU has embarked on a transformative journey in semiconductor manufacturing, securing $6.1 billion in funding under the CHIPS and Science Act to support its ambitious expansion plans in the United States. This landmark agreement, signed in collaboration with the Biden-Harris Administration, represents a significant milestone in the revitalization of domestic memory chip production.\n\nReviving Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nMicron's commitment to invest approximately $50 billion in gross capex for leading-edge memory manufacturing over the next decade aligns with the broader national agenda to bolster America's semiconductor capabilities. The $6.1 billion in grants will facilitate the construction of cutting-edge memory fabs in Idaho and New York, paving the way for a resurgence of semiconductor production on American soil.\n\nThis significant development comes on the heels of Micron's earlier announcement of multi-billion-dollar investments aimed at setting up chip factories in the country. In September 2022, the company unveiled plans to invest approximately $15 billion through the end of the decade in building a new fabrication factory for manufacturing memory chips in Idaho. This initiative marked a significant milestone as it represented the United States' first memory chip manufacturing facility in two decades.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote\n\nMoreover, in October 2022, Micron announced plans to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a factory in upstate New York. This ambitious undertaking is set to be the largest semiconductor fabrication facility in the history of the United States, further solidifying Micron's commitment to expanding its domestic manufacturing capabilities.\n\nMicron’s investment plans will help the company raise its memory chip output in the United States. The company has a long-term strategic target of bringing American-made DRAM chip production to 40% of its total global output over the next decade.\n\nMicron's expansion plans not only strengthen the nation's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities but also foster innovation and supply chain resilience. By co-locating research and development (R&D) centers with manufacturing facilities, Micron aims to accelerate technology deployment and improve time to market for leading-edge products. Additionally, the establishment of leading-edge memory fabs in the United States will reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and enhance supply chain security.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strategic partnership between Micron, federal agencies and state governments underscores a shared commitment to advancing U.S. technological leadership and enhancing economic and national security.\n\nImpact on Economic Growth\n\nBy harnessing the power of federal grants and state incentives, Micron aims to establish state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities that will create an estimated 75,000 domestic jobs over the next two decades. Micron's planned investments in Idaho and New York are poised to have a transformative impact on local economies, with the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs.\n\nIn Idaho, the project is expected to generate 2,000 Micron jobs, 4,500 construction jobs and 15,000 indirect jobs. Meanwhile, in New York, it will result in 9,000 Micron jobs, 4,500 construction jobs and 40,000 indirect jobs. These investments represent the single largest private investments ever made in Idaho and New York, signifying a significant boost to regional economic growth.\n\nIn addition to creating jobs, Micron's investments will support community development and workforce training initiatives in Idaho and New York. The company's commitment to K-12 education programs, university partnerships and community-based investments will help build a strong semiconductor talent pipeline and ensure long-term economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, Micron's investment marks a significant milestone in the revitalization of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. By harnessing federal grants and state incentives, Micron aims to establish state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities that will create thousands of jobs, foster innovation and enhance supply chain resilience. The company's long-term vision underscores its commitment to advancing American technology leadership and driving economic growth for years to come.\n\nOther Chipmakers’ Domestic Expansion Plan\n\nThe semiconductor industry is witnessing a trend of companies like Intel Corporation INTC, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM announcing plans to invest billions of dollars in setting up manufacturing facilities in the United States. Like Micron, these companies are also eligible for significant chip grants under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, further incentivizing their expansion into the U.S. market.\n\nFor instance, Intel has announced its intention to invest $20 billion to build two new chip factories in Arizona, while Samsung is planning to invest $17 billion to build a new chip factory in Texas. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has revealed plans to construct a semiconductor fab in Arizona, with an investment of $12 billion.\n\nThese investments underscore the semiconductor industry's recognition of the strategic importance of the U.S. market and the favorable regulatory environment established by the 2022 Chips and Science Act. By establishing manufacturing plants in the United States, semiconductor companies not only gain access to chip grants but also benefit from proximity to key customers, research institutions and a skilled workforce.\n\nFurthermore, the 2022 Chips and Science Act provides significant financial incentives, including grants, tax credits and funding for research and development, to semiconductor companies investing in domestic manufacturing. This legislation aims to accelerate innovation, strengthen national security and ensure a stable and resilient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Tech Stocks to Take You From $50,000 to $250,000 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "While the broader stock market can often be unpredictable, investors continue their search for unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024. Among the top contenders are companies harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, renewable energy and e-commerce.\n\nOften characterized by their significant growth potential and established market positioning, these tech giants demonstrate an unwavering ability to thrive in the face of adversity. Moreover, they have a sound track record of reporting strong revenue and earnings growth over the years. As the digital revolution accelerates, these top unstoppable tech stocks will continue to shape the future.\n\nNow, here are the top three unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company with a unique footing and dominance in a critical part of the semiconductor industry. They manufacture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, a complex technology essential for producing cutting-edge chips for smartphones, computers and AI applications.\n\nThe company is special due to its unique patents and exclusive rights to EUV lithography systems. There are only a handful of companies that have access to these machines, and their monopoly in the market makes ASML an extremely important company. The global chip shortage, which started during the pandemic, has been a positive for ASML. That is because demand remained high for its EUV systems, granting the company significant pricing power. In FY23, ASML delivered a record revenue of $27.6 billion. EPS skyrocketed 41% year-over-year (YOY) to $19.91 per share, with gross margins above street estimates. While this year is labeled as a ‘’transition year,’’ management expects a stronger second half of 2024.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) remains one of the best unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024. While operating in a different semiconductor segment than ASML, Applied Materials specializes in tools and equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nApplied Materials plays a crucial role in the multi-step process of chip production. The company benefits tremendously from the continued expansion in chip manufacturing by some of the biggest industry players like TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Over the past 12 to 18 months, the wafer fabrication market saw a huge drop in spending. That inevitably impacted Applied Materials, which is a major beneficiary of this high barrier to entry market. However, it was able to weather the storm, and a rebound in the semiconductor equipment market is underway. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 3% YOY to $26.5 billion. EPS increased 9% YOY to a record $8.11 per share, with FCF up 65% to $7.6 billion. The turn of the semiconductor cycle is brewing, and Applied Materials valuation leaves a ton of room for growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is the undisputed e-commerce leader in Latin America. Often referred to as “the Amazon of Latin America,” MercadoLibre is on pace to deliver outsized returns over the next decade.\n\nThe company built a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing online marketplaces, its own payment solution (Mercado Pago) and a robust logistics network. Latin America’s growing middle class and internet usage provide a solid runway for accelerated growth in e-commerce adoption. Additionally, the company’s improving financial performance will be the catalyst to send shares soaring. In FY23, revenue increased an astonishing 37% YOY to $14.47 billion. Net income swelled 104% YOY to $987 million, nearly eclipsing the $1 billion mark. Moreover, the operating margin expanded by 280 bps, with FCF hitting a record $4.63 billion. MercadoLibre is making all the right moves, and its expansive ecosystem and dominance in LATAM make it well-positioned for long-term success.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Tech Stocks For Your Must-Own List",
        "content": "If you want to beat the market these days, you need to be investing in A-rated tech stocks. The technology sector, by far, has been the best stock market sector for the last several quarters, thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nDespite a recent pullback, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up more than 30% in the last 12 months, topping both the S&P 500 (22% gain) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (13% gain).\n\nA-rated tech stocks make ideal picks for growth investors because the sector is full of companies known for rapid growth and innovation. Tech companies are often on the ground floor of the most market-moving advances — like generative AI — that can revolutionize the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs technology becomes a greater factor in today’s world — playing a key role in banking, industry, energy, commerce, aerospace and manufacturing — tech companies can capitalize since they play an increasingly crucial role in everyday life.\n\nThe best way to find A-rated tech stocks is to use the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader is a free tool that ranks every stock on an “A” through “F” scale based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors.\n\nIf you’re looking to buy into some of the hottest stocks in recent months, these names are poised to deliver.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been my top choice in any list of A-rated tech stocks for a while now. And why not?\n\nThe chipmaker has as much as a 90% share in the high-powered graphics processing units that are most responsible for generative AI applications. And Nvidia has more up its sleeve — its GB200 Blackwell processor that’s coming out later this year is estimated to be four times faster than the H100 GPU.\n\nNvidia had massive growth in 2023 with its stock price of 239%. While there are fears that Nvidia’s growth may stall out in the beginning of this year as companies wait for the Blackwell processors, I think that the demand for generative AI is still going to power NVDA stock through the first half of the year.\n\nNVDA stock is up 61% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors in Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) have just as much reason to be bullish as their peers who hold NVDA stock. Palantir is up 164% over the last 12 months as the company’s commercial division showed rapid growth.\n\nFor years, Palantir made its bread and butter by serving the intelligence and defense industries, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide real-time analysis to the Pentagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in the last quarter of 2023, Palantir saw 32% growth in its commercial segment, totaling $284 million in revenue. That compares to $324 million in government contract revenue in the quarter — but only 5% growth in that segment.\n\nI’m expecting the commercial revenue to top the government revenue soon. Palantir’s new Artificial Intelligence Platform works with both government and commercial clients. And Palantir also has a new agreement with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will allow Palantir to use Oracle’s cloud network to deploy products such as its Gotham and AIP platforms.\n\nIn all, I think that the recent pullback in PLTR stock makes for a great buying opportunity for a company that’s only going to grow for the rest of 2024 — and possibly beyond.\n\nPLTR stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the first — and best — streaming companies. And it has proven to be able to adapt even in the face of massive competition to retain its position as king of the heap.\n\nNetflix showed a lot of vulnerability in 2022, with its share price dropping to below $200. Growth slowed and it appeared that other streaming services were finally starting to catch up and possibility surpass NFLX.\n\nBut then Netflix made what I think was a bold, and inspired business decision. It decided to toss away its longtime wink and nod to account sharing and instead charge a fee to any account holder who had someone outside of their household log in.\n\nRather than facing a backlash from the public, Netflix saw a massive windfall from the move for one reason — because people saw value in the product, and they didn’t want to give it up. In the first quarter after the change, Netflix saw an increase of 8.8 million paid subscribers.\n\nFor the first quarter, NFLX saw revenue up 15% from a year ago to $9.37 billion. And it forecast Q2 revenue of $9.49 billion, which would be a nearly 16% increase from last year.\n\nNFLX is hitting on all cylinders. Again. The stock is up 14% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPDD Holdings (PPD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPPD Holdings (NASDAQ:PPD) is the parent company of the Chinese e-commerce company Pinduoduo, which specializes in serving China’s mom-and-pop agricultural industry.\n\nPinduoduo makes it possible for small-scale farmers to sell their fruits and vegetables directly to consumers.\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there. PPD Holdings is expanding into Western markets via its Temu app, which provides Chinese goods that are sharply discounted. Temu is among the most downloaded apps in the U.S., German, the U.K., France, Canada and Italy.\n\nIn the U.S., Temu is the No. two shopping app, with monthly users increasing by 950% on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings in the fourth quarter included revenue of $12.5 billion, up 123% from a year ago. PDD brought in a profit of $3.1 billion and an increase of 146% from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHowever, there’s some risk involved with PDD. Increased tensions between the U.S. and Beijing increase the likelihood that companies like PDD could face additional restrictions from Washington. That’s one reason why PDD stock is down 12% so far in 2024, despite its earnings growth and potential.\n\nPDD stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. But investing in this stock means paying attention to global politics.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe inclusion of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) proves that you can find exciting A-rated tech stocks even among the oldest and most established tech companies on the planet.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations and punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. IBM was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, it’s simply one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world. Its Watson AI engine and Watsonx generative AI platform have the potential to power IBM through the decade by partnering with enterprise customers.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2024 included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income of $1.6 billion was a massive 69% increase from last year, and earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM issued guidance for full-year revenue growth in the mid- single digits, and expects to generate roughly $12 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nIBM stock is up 12% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you love music, you probably know all about Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). Spotify is a digital music, podcast and video service that provides countless tunes and audio files from hundreds of artists.\n\nThere are a few ways to make money. It sells advertisements that are targeted to its massive base of 388 million monthly active users. And it also has a premium ad-free subscription service that has 239 million monthly active users.\n\nBoth levels of users are growing rapidly. Spotify says the number monthly active users using Spotify for free increased 22% in the first quarter from a year ago, while paid premium memberships increased by 14% from a year ago.\n\nAnd that means much greater profits for SPOT stock. Spotify reported revenue of $3.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Profits of $1 billion were up 31% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThat’s music to any investor’s ears. SPOT stock is up 50% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs technology becomes more critical, more of our personal information and finances are online. Cloud computing makes it possible to tap into business networks at home, in the office or through a mobile device, but there are always bad actors who are looking to do damage by breaking into a network to steal or cause mayhem.\n\nSo my top pick for cybersecurity stock is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Its endpoint security solutions include its Falcon platform, which secures entry points on servers, smartphones and laptops.\n\nThe company offers 27 cloud modules on its Falcon platform on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, including corporate endpoint security, IT operations, cloud security, data protection, identity protection and cybersecurity generative AI.\n\nRoughly 64% of CrowdStrike customers subscribe to at least five modules, giving CrowdStrike an impressive revenue stream. The company brought in $845.3 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 33% from a year ago.\n\nCRWD stock should continue to perform as its customers base grows and its SaaS model flourishes. CrowdStrike is up 16% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, SPOT and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "One prediction says that from 2024 to 2030, the metaverse market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%, leading to an eventual $507.8 billion valuation, putting it on the radar for every savvy investor. However, does the growth figure mean you should buy metaverse stocks on the dip?\n\nThe answer is yes. An easy reason for this is the many partnerships around the concept. Hexagon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a classic example, as is CoStar‘s (NASDAQ: CSGP) acquisition of Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) for $1.6 billion. That alone was big news for real estate and 3D digital twin technology. It also indicates that the metaverse’s real-world applications are highly valued and already relevant to investors.\n\nWith double-digit market growth and all these industry changes, let’s look at some metaverse stocks to buy when they go down. Each of these stocks has a double-digit upside as well. The first pick gives you the hardware for the metaverse. The second one is a favorite among developers. The last option is famous because it has a unique game engine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMetaverse systems need Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) technology to make their graphics and virtual worlds look good. Ray tracing improves the look of virtual worlds on GPUs from Nvidia’s RTX line by adding accurate lighting and shadows.\n\nNvidia’s edge computing solutions also lower the delay in large virtual worlds by handling data closer to where it comes from. Its CloudXR also streams from the cloud so you can have realistic virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences even if you don’t have powerful gear nearby.\n\nNvidia’s Omniverse, on the other hand, is a big step forward for real-time models and simulated worlds. Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) says that by 2025, 22% of all Americans, or 32.6 million people, will work from home, making the Omniverse a key part of NVDA’s portfolio.\n\nLast, the company is also making new products, like Blackwell series microchips with better artificial intelligence (AI), because the need for AI is growing.\n\nThe stock price, unfortunately, is having a hard time breaking above $950. Analysts still think that the stock will go up because of progress made in AI. The average price target is around $1,005, with an upside potential of 26%, making it one of the best metaverse stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven though Unity’s (NYSE:U) platform is easy to use, its stock is down over 39% because of lower-than-expected earnings for the current quarter. The upside potential, however, is over 36%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a business model built on subscriptions, Unity has added more products by forming smart agreements and buying other companies. But the most recent quarterly numbers are mixed.\n\nEven though Unity made more revenue than expected, its loss per share was 66 cents instead of 46 cents per share. Unity is realigning its main business groups to improve operations efficiency and cost management. Non-GAAP running costs will go down by $250 million a year.\n\nThe business hopes to finish the first part of its strategic restart to focus on its core business by the end of the first quarter. Unity plans to lower costs and speed up growth in the second half of 2024.​​\n\nOn a brighter note, Unity Software’s primary membership business gained 18% outside China in Q4 2023. This year, the metaverse market in China will hit $15.9 billion, so how well Unity does in this market is very important.\n\nLast, the company made using Ziva VFX and other related technologies easier. Ziva VFX is a new way to create visual effects and real-time rendering, improving the company’s technology stack and developer support.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike social media businesses, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) seeks to retain young people in the ecosystem for life. It’s easier said than done. The stock was popular while youngsters were bored at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. With schools open, it must compete for time. No suprise, the stock is down over 18% in 2024.\n\nHowever, on balance, RBLX is not doing too badly, with the latest quarter a beacon of hope for investors looking for metaverse stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nRoblox’s Q4 sales rose 30% to $749.9 million, and bookings rose 25% to $1,126.8 million. Compared to last year, daily average users (DAUs) rose 22% to 71.5 million. DAUs for users 13 and over increased by 28%, making up over 58% of the entire DAU base.\n\nRoblox’s worldwide growth has grown 23% in DAUs outside the U.S. and Canada. Noteworthy increases include 45% in Japan and 59% in India. The quarter witnessed the most brand interactions, with 69 big companies engaging.\n\nAltogether, with healthy growth and an expanding presence outside North America, RBLX stock has what it takes to realize its 42% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "The Top 3 Machine Learning Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The U.S. economy is poised for remarkable growth driven by advancements in machine learning. This transformative technology is set to revolutionize various industries like manufacturing, retail and healthcare. Machine learning will enhance quality control and automation in manufacturing, leading to more efficient production processes and personalized products. Retail will see improved data analysis, personalized shopping experiences and increased use of robotics for tasks like inventory management. Machine learning will advance diagnostics, treatment and prevention in healthcare, allowing for earlier disease detection and tailored patient care. Machine learning will revolutionize our society in the next couple of years.\n\nThe machine learning industry expects immense growth over the next few years. From 2023 to 2032, the industry is expected to grow from $51.48 billion to $771.38 billion, exhibiting a CAGR of 35.09%. The number one reason for this development is the freshness of machine learning. These top machine learning stocks are all releasing new technological and product innovations, making all of them strong buys.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: Oracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a computer technology company specializing in integrated cloud applications and a cloud infrastructure platform. It is valued at $115.34, an increase of 21% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nORCL’s market cap grew from $289.81 billion in 2023 to $314.88 billion in 2024, representing an 8.65% growth rate. Other financials, like EBIT Margin, also showed promise, reaching 29.15%, or 514.8% more than the sector median. EV/Sales were valued at 7.53, 151.02% more than the sector median of 3.00. These metrics reaffirm ORCL’s profitability and define it as a stock for growth and profit.\n\nORCL made headlines recently by adding generative AI capabilities to its Fusion Cloud Applications suite, its flagship product. The addition enhances the product, making it ideal for finance, marketing and service. That innovation is bound to see appreciation in the stock price amid the AI craze and the quality of this product. In addition, to bolster its AI, Oracle partnered with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) to create practical yet secure AI. That partnership aids Oracle in boosting its grip on AI while building a reliable relationship with a leader in the field.\n\nORCL’s innovations regarding the cloud and AI and its adequate financials mean this stock will prosper. It is a top technology stock, prompting me to give it a Buy rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that provides cyberattack and cloud workload services. With a 132% YoY growth rate, CrowdStrike currently stands at $297.62. Additionally, it shows high potential, with Yahoo Finance analysts forecasting a 12-month price median of $393.65.\n\nThe company has consistently had revenue growth ranging from 32% to 42% over the last four quarters. In each of these periods, the revenue has been over four times more than the cost of revenue. Additionally, the FCF showed a slight dip in Q3 2023 but has been making its way up and is valued at $283.58 million in Q1 24. Like FCF, the EPS (Basic) started making new growth in Q3 2023, when it was $.04 and has grown to $.22 in Q1 2024.\n\nThe enhancement of CrowdStrike has been largely due to AI and further technological advancements. Recently, it was announced that CrowdStrike and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are collaborating to combine the powers of cybersecurity and generative AI. More specifically, this collaboration is said to lead Nvidia AI to the CrowdStrike Falcon XDR platform. That can lead to advancing AI and machine learning and, further, developing cybersecurity and cloud services that CrowdStrike offers.\n\nCrowdStrike is built upon developing technology and has excellent potential for the future. Its collaboration with Nvidia marks the first step in its machine learning and AI development.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: Palantir (PLTR) An image of the Palantir company logo\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon/Shutterstock\n\nPalantir is a SaaS company specializing internationally in the public and private sectors. It provides a robust end-to-end infrastructure, which makes its products competitive. Its services incorporate AI and ML to make raw data usable.\n\nPLTR saw its first profitable year in FY2023, making $209.82 million. The company’s revenue is expected to grow rapidly, with ever-increasing EPS estimates. YoY quarterly growth is sitting at 202.5%, primarily due to 2023 being a break-out year. An exemplary debt/equity of 6.44% corroborates all other indicators of a strong financial status.\n\nAll seven Wall St. analysts covering PLTR have raised EPS estimates in the past 90 days, which is crucial given that Q1 earnings will be released on May 6th. The expansion of Palantir has come with many accolades, leading to it gaining market recognition. Towards the end of FY2023, PLTR was the No. 1 Vendor in AI, data science, and machine learning. An increase in good press will surely increase the number of clients, leading to higher earnings.\n\nWhile many are bearish on this stock, I am pretty bullish, given that earnings are rising and frequent positive EPS revisions exist. A solid technical base and exceptional finances make this stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Owns All the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. These 3 Are His Favorites.",
        "content": "Few investors deserve the adjective \"legendary.\" Ken Griffin is one of them. He founded Citadel in 1990. It now ranks as the most successful hedge fund of all time.\n\nWith Citadel's portfolio including thousands of holdings, it isn't surprising that Griffin owns all the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. However, three appear to be his favorites.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nCitadel owns a larger position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) than any other individual stock. The only bigger holding for the hedge fund is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. At the end of 2023, Citadel's stake in Nvidia totaled $1.8 billion.\n\nImportantly, Griffin continued to add to Citadel's stake in Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2023. He bought an additional 1.58 million shares, increasing his hedge fund's position in the chipmaker by nearly 77%.\n\nWe can easily guess why the billionaire investor likes Nvidia so much. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have enjoyed staggering demand as organizations scrambled to build, train, and run generative AI applications.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nMicrosoft isn't too far behind Nvidia as the second-largest Magnificant Seven holding for Citadel. However, I wouldn't say the tech giant is Griffin's second-favorite Magnificent Seven stock for a simple reason: He sold nearly 16% of Citadel's stake in Microsoft in Q4. But it's a different story with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAt the end of 2023, Amazon ranked behind Microsoft as Citadel's third-largest individual stock holding. Griffin is clearly bullish about Amazon, evidenced by his increase of Citadel's stake in the stock by almost 223% in Q4.\n\nWhat is so attractive about Amazon? I'd put improving profitability near the top of the list. Griffin also undoubtedly recognizes the tremendous opportunity AI presents for Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Citadel's fifth-largest position excluding the big stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Exiting 2023, Citadel owned 2.46 million shares of the social media giant worth over $869 million.\n\nBefore Q4, Meta wasn't nearly as big of a holding for the hedge fund. Griffin bought 1.37 million shares in the last quarter of 2023, increasing Citadel's stake in Meta by 127%. As was the case for the other top Magnificent Seven stocks, the hedge fund also owned call and put options for Meta.\n\nI think Griffin likes Meta for some of the same reasons he likes Amazon. Meta's bottom line has improved significantly thanks in part to cost-cutting initiatives. The company also should have a major growth opportunity with AI, albeit in some different ways than Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these Magnificent Seven stocks smart picks now?\n\nNvidia, Amazon, and Meta have retreated from their all-time highs in recent weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if they fall further. However, significant pullbacks would create excellent buying opportunities for all three stocks, in my view.\n\nCompetition is increasing in the AI chip market. I don't expect Nvidia to command as formidable a market position going forward as it has so far. On the other hand, the demand for AI chips will almost certainly continue to increase. Nvidia's innovation should keep it on top.\n\nAmazon isn't in danger of giving up its leadership in e-commerce. Its AWS unit might lose market share to other cloud providers, but I still expect it to deliver strong growth as organizations move their apps and data to the cloud. I also look for Amazon to do what it's always done and find new avenues for growth.\n\nMeta has demonstrated the resilience of its social media platforms. AI-powered business messaging could be a key growth driver for the company for years to come. I also like Meta's decision to open up its Horizon virtual reality operating system to third-party device makers.\n\nDoes Ken Griffin still view these Magnificent Seven stocks as good picks? We should find out in a few weeks when Citadel discloses its 2024 first-quarter holdings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Monster Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock Up 45,900% in 20 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) accomplished a great deal in the past two decades. The chipmaker solidified its status as the gold standard in graphics processors for video games and other multimedia. Moreover, its accelerated computing platform has become the premier solution for demanding data center workloads like analytics, artificial intelligence, and scientific simulation.\n\nDuring that period, Nvidia saw its share price soar 45,900% as it transitioned from computer graphics trailblazer to data center powerhouse. To contextualize that figure, $10,000 invested in Nvidia in April 2004 would now be worth about $4.6 million.\n\nThe stock has been especially hot lately, with shares tripling in the past year alone. Even so, Wall Street is still overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. The stock carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" and its median one-year price target of $1,000 per share implies 22% upside from its current price. Even more compelling, among the 60 analysts that follow Nvidia, not a single one recommends selling right now.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia dominates the market for accelerated computing solutions\n\nNvidia is best known for inventing the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip now synonymous with ultra-realistic 3D graphics and accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware to speed-up demanding data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics. To quantify its success, Nvidia holds more than 95% market in workstation GPUs, 94% market share in data center GPUs, and more than 80% market share in AI processors, according to analysts.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is more than a GPU company. Its data center hardware portfolio also includes the Grace central processing unit (CPU) and high-performance networking platforms purpose-built for AI. Additionally, Nvidia has broadened its ability to monetize 3D graphics and AI by delving into subscription software and cloud services.\n\nNvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of development tools, software frameworks, and pretrained models that help businesses build all manner of AI applications, including computer vision, conversational intelligence, and recommender systems. Additionally, DGX Cloud pairs Nvidia AI Enterprise software with supercomputing infrastructure to create a comprehensive AI-as-a-service offering.\n\nSimilarly, Nvidia Omniverse Cloud comprises hardware, software, and services for 3D application development. It also serves as a simulation engine capable of training and evaluating machine learning models for autonomous robots and self-driving cars. Additionally, Omniverse includes tools for developing interactive avatars that address use cases like non-playable video game characters and digital customer service agents.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, Nvidia's robust accelerated computing platform comprises hardware, software, and services that position the company as a one-stop shop for 3D graphics and artificial intelligence. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino says that full-stack strategy affords Nvidia an \"incredible competitive moat.\"\n\nNvidia followed a strong fourth quarter with a wave of product announcements\n\nNvidia reported impressive financial results in the fourth quarter, crushing estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue climbed 265% to $22.1 billion, gross profit margin expanded 10 percentage points, and non-GAAP net income soared 486% to $5.16 per diluted share.\n\nThe impetus behind that stellar performance was strength in the data center category, something CEO Jensen Huang attributed to two tailwinds. First, data centers are transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Second, data centers are investing aggressively in the computing infrastructure required to support generative AI.\n\nThe chart below provides more detail on Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue across its four primary product categories. The chart shows revenue growth across Nvidia's four largest product categories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024). OEM & Other revenue has been excluded because it accounted for less than 1% of total revenue.\n\nNvidia announced several noteworthy products at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March. The headline announcement was its latest GPU architecture, Blackwell. \"Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell is the engine to power this new industrial revolution,\" said CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia announced a new superchip that pairs Blackwell GPUs and Grace CPUs, new high-performance networking platforms, and its next-generation supercomputer for autonomous vehicles. The company also announced Project Groot, which comprises a machine learning model and supercomputer purpose-built for humanoid robots.\n\nWall Street expects strong earnings growth, but Nvidia stock is far from cheap\n\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is forecasted to grow at 28% annually through 2030, and AI spending across hardware, software, and services is projected to increase at 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at 30%-plus annual sales growth through the end of the decade, which implies similar earnings growth.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 69 times earnings sits somewhere between reasonable and expensive. In other words, patient investors can buy a very small position in this stock right now, but it may be more prudent to wait for a slightly cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing city authorities have announced subsidies for firms that purchase domestically produced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, as China seeks to develop its semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on foreign technology.\n\nThe sizes of subsidies were not specified in a document outlining the initiative by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology dated April 24.\n\n\"Companies that purchase domestically controlled GPU chips for intelligent computing services will receive support based on a certain percentage of their investment,\" the document showed, referring to chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nUnder the initiative, the city targets 100% self-reliance in smart computing infrastructure hardware and software by 2027.\n\nAchieving self-sufficiency in AI chips, which are essential for training AI models, has become an urgent task for China as the U.S. tightens restrictions on exporting advanced computing products to the country citing national security concerns.\n\nRestrictions announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce late last year prevented exports to China of advanced chips such as the A800, H800 and H100 from market leader Nvidia.\n\nChina is cultivating its own AI chip industry in which the Ascend 910 chips of Huawei Technologies are widely seen as a potential alternative to products from U.S. rival Nvidia.\n\nGovernment-related entities, known as \"intelligent computing centres\", have been the major buyers of domestic AI chips.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Adds shares in paragraph 2, profit forecast in paragraph 9, background throughout)\n\nApril 25 (Reuters) - Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates on Thursday, as it faces weak demand for its traditional data center and personal computer chips amid efforts to build its contract manufacturing business.\n\nShares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell close to 5% in extended trading.\n\nEnterprises have prioritized spending on advanced and speedy AI server chips, hurting demand for Intel's central processing units (CPUs), which have been the mainstay chip powering data centers for decades.\n\nAccording to analysts, a surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) useful for AI applications has reduced the appetite for CPUs, which are Intel's main product.\n\nNvidia's powerful GPUs dominate the AI market, as large and small companies have sought to acquire tens of billions of dollars worth of its processors. Intel announced its latest AI chip, Gaudi 3, earlier this year, but it has struggled to take market share from Nvidia.\n\nPreliminary results from IDC showed the PC market returned to growth in the first quarter after about two years of declines. Intel's projections cast a shadow on this expected recovery as it is one of the largest suppliers of PC chips.\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry, is working to catch industry leader TSMC, but its profitability is years away.\n\nThe company expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to 13.5 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.57 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nIntel forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share, compared with estimates of 25 cents per share.

        "title": "The Top 3 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "Higher interest rates, pricier debt and an overemphasis on mega-caps over the past year mean that top small-cap stocks have played second fiddle to big-name giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But tides seem to be turning as investors increasingly seek diversification away from a handful of high-multiple tech stocks and toward a more diverse array of product types, operational structures and size — all of which small-cap stocks have in spades.\n\nWhile small-cap stocks haven’t kept up with larger companies, considering the Russell 2000’s 1% loss since January compared to the S&P 500’s 7% gain, the relative underperformance is good news. The “worst in class” small-cap stocks are either delisted or on their way out, meaning those still standing tend to have better financial and operational management, equipping them to ride out whatever economic conditions arise next. Better yet, relative underperformance means that top small-cap stocks are on sale — but maybe not for long.\n\nMind Medicine (MNMD) MNMD stock: A scientist holding a test tube in a stock image. AI Recommended Biotech Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike many speculative sectors, psychedelics stocks saw their value peak amid 2021’s pandemic-era ZIRP exuberance. But, despite falling far from past highs, small-cap psychedelic therapy Mind Medicine (NASDAQ:MNMD) is quietly rebuilding itself into a major competitor in the wider pharmaceutical space.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMost impactfully, Mind Medicine snagged a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA last month for its LSD-based anxiety disorder treatment protocol. Initial testing indicated that a single dosage improved patient outcomes by 65% 12 weeks later. By comparison, Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ) ketamine-based anxiety treatment needs multiple dosages from the outset and seems to have a wider range of negative side effects during treatment.\n\nAs with many small-cap biotech stocks, Mind Medicine isn’t yet profitable. Still, with plans to bring its LSD anxiety treatment into Phase III trials later this year and a range of additional treatments in its pipeline, Mind Medicine stands out as a top small-cap stock to buy now if you’re interested in breaking your portfolio free from legacy pharma stocks.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a uniquely diversified small-cap stock focusing on a range of infrastructure solutions. While spreading themselves too thin remains a risk, management has thus far targeted ideal sales segments to drive the company’s growth. Unlike many infrastructure-centric stocks, Sterling’s unique emphasis on data centers, eCommerce warehousing and similar initiatives puts it at the forefront of multiple emerging trends. To use a well-worn metaphor, Sterling is selling picks and shovels to legions of gold miners in multiple industries, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and scaled product distribution.\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversification seems to be paying dividends, too, as the company’s end-of-year report included net income nearly doubling compared to 2022 and a substantial $2.37 billion backlog in its queue — meaning they have plenty of cash coming in for the foreseeable future, bolstered further by the company’s mid-March announcement of a new data center project worth as much as $100 million. Infrastructure stocks could see a sector-wide bump as we near election season. Of the many alternatives, few top small-cap stocks stand out as much as Sterling in terms of comprehensive infrastructure operations.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayer\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap agriculture and construction equipment stock Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) may not have the same name recognition as larger competitors, like Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but that doesn’t detract from its fundamental strength. The company posted its Q4 and end-of-year report a few weeks ago and, across the board, outperformed expectations — including a 25% annual sales bump and nearly 10% boost to yearly earnings even as supply chain and fuel costs made standard operations pricier.\n\nDespite its fundamental strength, Titan seems critically undervalued and trades at just 0.19x sales, 4.6x earnings and 0.80x book value. The poor multiples seem particularly misaligned with reality as the company’s 3-year income growth trajectory (while not spectacular) sits at a respectable 79%. The company took a cautious tone detailing its 2025 outlook, which includes single-digit percentage gain forecasts across its segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings. If Titan even slightly exceeds its conservative estimates, expect the small-cap value stock to surge. In the meantime, it’s hard to argue that the stock isn’t a steal at these prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Nvidia’s AI Dominance: Why the Chip Giant Has What It Takes to Weather the Storm",
        "content": "In the wake of the recent, large drop in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, positive comments about the company by a top analyst who specializes in the chips space, strong quarterly financial results by the firm’s main supplier, and Chinese entities’ purchase of Nvidia’s chips, I’ve become significantly more bullish on Nvidia stock.\n\nThat’s because I now believe that Nvidia’s AI chips business is strong enough to thrive despite the increased competition that the firm is encountering, while the shares’ valuation provides a sufficient cushion against both this stepped-up competition and the likely, future downturn of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs a result, I recommend that investors looking for exposure to a large, well-established firm at the heart of the AI revolution buy relatively small amounts of Nvidia stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAn Improved Valuation and Upbeat Comments by a Top Analyst\n\nNvidia stock declined 14% in the month that ended on April 21, and the shares were nearly 18% off their all-time high as of pre-market trading on April 23. As a result, the name now has a forward price-earnings ratio of 33.11 times. With analysts, on a average, expecting the firm’s earnings per share to jump to $24.76 this year from $12.96 last year, the stock’s P/E ratio is fairly low, given the chip maker’s growth outlook.\n\nMeanwhile, Stacy Rasgon, a well-respected chip analyst at investment bank Bernstein, recently said that NVDA is still benefiting from “good … demand,” while the firm does not appear to have experienced any “order cancellations.” Moreover, the sales of its recently increased products are growing, and its business is unlikely to experience a correction anytime soon, Rasgon said.\n\nPowerful Results by Nvidia’s Main Supplier and Chinese Purchases\n\nNvidia’s main supplier, Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM), reported strong first-quarter results earlier this month as its revenue climbed 13% year over year and its net income jumped 9% versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nAnd more importantly, TSM expects its sales to surge 20% to 25% for the full year. Unsurprisingly, TSM noted that “insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” had driven its strong financial results and impressive guidance. Since Nvidia is the leading supplier of AI chips, it should benefit from the “insatiable” demand that TSM described.\n\nOn April 23, Reuters reported that “Chinese research institutes” had purchased Nvidia’s top chips, despite restrictions that Washington had placed on the export of such chips. As a result, I believe that Nvidia’s revenue from China will be higher than expected, increasing the likelihood that its Q1 results will meet or exceed Wall Street’s average estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the “biggest cloud providers” in America are reportedly poised to spend very large amounts of money on NVDA’s chips.\n\nNvidia Is Still Facing Major Threats\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, Nvidia is facing major, competitive threats from a multitude of companies, including the major cloud providers themselves, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). And there have been signs that the inventories of a number of its customers are starting to build.\n\nOver time, I believe that these factors are likely to put significant, downward pressure on the firm’s average selling prices and margins.\n\nMeanwhile, with Congress looking likely to pass a bill that would force crypto sellers to follow bank secrecy laws, I expect Nvidia’s crypto business to come under significant pressure in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia’s business still appears strong despite the increased threats that it’s facing, while its valuation has dropped a great deal and appears to be attractive. Given these points, I have become more bullish on the shares but continue to view them as a cautious buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in INTC.

        "title": "Why ServiceNow (NOW) Shares Are Falling Today",
        "content": "Why ServiceNow (NOW) Shares Are Falling Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of enterprise workflow software maker ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) fell 7.6% in the morning session after the company reported first-quarter earnings results. One negative was that calculated billings missed by 0.5%, and large customer net adds slowed a bit from historical pace. Guidance was another reason why the stock traded down. Subscription revenue guidance for next quarter missed by about 3% and implies 22% (constant currency) growth, further deceleration from this quarter. Full year guidance was maintained from previous and calls for ~30% operating and FCF margins.\n\nOverall it was a fine quarter. cRPO (calculated remaining performance obligations - leading growth indicator) beat by 0.4% (essentially in line), total RPO beat by 2.8%, subscription rev beat by 0.3% (in line), total revenue beat by 0.6%, adjusted EBIT beat by 5%, and FCF beat by 24%. Subscription revenue grew 24.5% yoy (constant currency), which is healthy and not much of a deceleration from last quarter's 25.5% yoy (constant currency) growth.\n\nOverall, the company is growing at a healthy pace at scale and growing profitably. Small expectations misses can cause some share price volatility in the short term as the market wrestles with valuation for a fairly expensive company, and this is what we're witnessing.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy ServiceNow? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nServiceNow's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 2 months ago, when the company gained 5.6% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter.\n\nThe strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nServiceNow is up 2.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $704.06 per share it is still trading 13.4% below its 52-week high of $812.94 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ServiceNow's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,703.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 oversold midcap stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of overbought, oversold, small cap, and mid cap stocks along with the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Oversold MidCap Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSince stocks are publicly traded, their prices fluctuate in response to economic and political news. The news can either cover specific firms or the broader economy, with this principle also determining the equities whose prices fluctuate in response to daily events. These fluctuations can be measured through indicators that can quantify whether a stock is oversold or overbought. These two descriptors of stock performance stem from the fact that human decisions, particularly those surrounding assets, are influenced by the market itself. As a result, collectively buying or selling stocks can make them oversold or overbought, and provide some opportunity to make a profit from stability that follows.\n\nStocks are determined to be overbought or oversold through an indicator called the relative strength index. This indicator measures share price performance and is often read along with current share prices to help make a trading decision. So, for instance, if a stock is thought to be oversold, and its price is rising, then some traders could be comfortable buying it. For more details on what RSI readings determine whether a stock is overbought or oversold, you can take a look at 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nMost news and media attention is focused on a collective of elite stocks called mega caps. These are among the largest companies in the world and are worth trillions of dollars. However, as a large portion of their share price growth has already occurred, and they control major sections of their markets, in terms of growth, mega cap stocks often lose out when compared to other stocks. These 'other' stocks can include small cap and mid cap stocks, and for the former, you can take a look at 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential.\n\nMidCap stocks are those stocks that have a market value ranging between $2 billion and $10 billion. They offer investors more stability than small cap stocks due to their stable business models and market share. Additionally, mid cap stocks also carry the potential to grow big in case of growth companies, and stability if the shares belong to stocks in the consumer staples sector.\n\nLooking at some recent top performing mid cap stocks, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX), Janux Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JANX), and Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALPN) have all delivered triple digit percentage returns year to date in 2024. Interestingly, not only are all of these stocks mid cap stocks, but they are also biotechnology firms. This allows them to collectively demonstrate the strong potential of the biotech sector, which always lures investors to pile in millions of dollars in research and development with the hopes of a proper payout in terms of share price performance should treatments secure regulatory clearance and patient adoption. To take a look at some mid and small cap biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are also buying, you can take a look at the 13 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting gears, the start of the second quarter of 2024 has seen investors shift their expectations for the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. Heading into the year and throughout Q1 2024, Wall Street was focused on artificial intelligence, and investors were optimistic about early rate cuts as well. However, inflation data for March and the strong performance of the labor market have shifted expectations and now, most folks expect fewer rate cuts in 2024. At the same time, with April 2024 coming to an end, AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a lot to prove too. While not a mid cap stock, NVIDIA's shares are up by 58% year to date and a stunning 421% since the start of 2023. Yet, the stock dropped by 10%, in a silent loss of $280 billion of market value that took place on the same trading day.\n\nSo what happened to NVIDIA's shares? Well, it was due to nothing that Jensen Huang or his team did. Instead, NVIDIA's shares appeared to have lost 10% of their value due to peer and rival Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) breaking from tradition and not issuing a preliminary financial report for its Q1 2024 performance. It appears that Wall Street is quite jittery, and investors are eager to position themselves for any untoward financial news in the Q1 2024 earnings season as they adjusted their portfolios well in advance of any official numbers from Super Micro. This adjustment appears to have taken place for NVIDIA as well and shone the spotlight even brighter on the upcoming earnings of the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most oversold stocks. A couple of names are McGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC), VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS), and PowerSchool Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:PWSC). 11 Oversold MidCap Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most oversold mid cap stocks to buy, we selected mid cap stocks with the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings and average analyst rating of Buy or better.\n\nFor these oversold mid cap stocks we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Oversold MidCap Stocks To Buy Now\n\n11. PagSeguro Digital Ltd.

        "title": "3 Long-Term Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "The mixed earnings season has led to a dip in several stocks. Despite beating expectations and reporting strong numbers, many companies have seen their stocks pull back. Do not make the mistake of dumping these stocks due to the dip. Instead, consider buying them at their lowest price and you will be able to make the most of the upside. Yes, greed isn’t a virtue but we do not want to be on the losing side of the stock market. A market selloff is a chance for smart investors to make their moves and take home solid companies that can hit a high in the future. Now is the time to identify the long-term stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nAll stocks aren’t the same which is why you need to be able to identify those that are worth holding for the long-term. A pullback will not lead to an immediate recovery and that means holding the stock for a few months. Here are three long-term stocks to buy on the dip. These are excellent businesses and some of the best in the industry but they have hit a bump lately. Buy them now and enjoy the upside later.\n\nLong-Term Stocks to Buy On the Dip: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 16% in the month, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is exchanging hands for $796 today and this stock is a buy on every dip. Despite losing value this month, the stock is up 65% year-to-date and is one of the best AI stocks to own right now. The upcoming earnings could take the stock to a new all-time high.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia is the biggest beneficiary of generative AI and it holds over 80% of the market share today. There is a massive imbalance in the demand and supply of AI chips and this is where the company is set to benefit.\n\nThe fears about an AI slowdown have led to a drop in several semiconductor stocks but I believe this is temporary. Even if there is a slowdown, Nvidia will not be the one to suffer. It has enough orders to keep going throughout 2024. The management is expecting a revenue of $24 billion in the quarter which is up from the revenue of $22.1 billion reported in the fourth quarter.\n\nNvidia is set to report results on May 22 and as it has done before, it could beat expectations and the shares could rally. I expect the company to report robust AI chip demand for the quarter and it could continue with the same momentum throughout the year. Competitors might be increasing but it is hard to beat the market domination of Nvidia. Even if another company catches up, Nvidia will lose a very small part of the market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is one opportunity you should never miss. Pounce on NVDA stock while you can.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is down 4% over the past month and has dropped after reporting results. Despite beating estimates, the stock dropped and is on a downward spree right now. Trading at $148 today, it is very close to the 52-week low of $143. However, this is a long-term stock to buy and hold. There are many reasons to like JNJ despite the recent pullback.\n\nThe company is one of the best in the industry and is focusing on the Medtech and innovative medicine segment. Yes, it is facing liabilities related to the talcum powder lawsuit but this is not its first time and the management can handle a lawsuit.\n\nThe company aims to grow 5% to 7% annually by 2030 driven by the pipeline of drugs. It expects 10 drugs to generate $5 billion in sales while another 15 drugs to generate between $1 billion and $5 billion.\n\nThe company also believes in acquisitions to expand its market share and strengthen its position. It is buying Shockwave Medical for $13.1 billion which will help expand its medtech portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has over a 100-year history and the company operates in an industry that is an integral part of the global economy. It reported sales of $21.38 billion in the first quarter with a net income of $5.35 billion. The company is a dividend giant with a yield of 3.34% and it has hiked dividends for over six decades. JNJ is one of the best stocks to buy in the dip.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) the netflix logo displayed on a tablet that a person is holding while laying down\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is down 11% in the month and has gone from $627 to $555 today. There are multiple reasons to make your move in this dip.\n\nDespite beating expectations and leading the subscriber growth to a new high, the stock dropped 9%. I believe the only reason behind the stock pullback is the unhappiness of the market on the management’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting next year as it was considered a pivotal metric for growth.\n\nSince it is not related to the company’s finances, I believe this dip is temporary and a chance to make your move. The company added 37.1 million subscribers in the quarter with a total of 269.9 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, a 16% increase year-over-year. This is also the fifth quarter of subscriber growth and speaks for the company’s strength. Additionally, the decision to crack down on password-sharing has helped Netflix generate higher revenue.\n\nThe company also sees higher revenue driven by advertising, which has remained a solid opportunity for many years. It offered a cheaper subscription tier which includes ads and this segment saw solid growth with 40% new sign-ups. By targeting users with a cheaper plan, it is also making money from the ad segment.\n\nThere is a lot of potential to grow in the coming years and Netflix may be down today but is not out.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Intel to report Q1 earnings as Wall Street eyes AI and foundry growth",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) will report its first quarter earnings results after the bell on Wednesday, with investors and analysts eyeing whether the recovery in the PC market and Intel’s AI investments are panning out for the chip giant.\n\nIntel is looking to grow its AI market share by challenging rivals Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator while hoping it can woo consumer and enterprise customers with its new AI PC lineup.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is expecting Intel to report earnings of $0.13 per share on revenue of $12.7 billion, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg. The company reported a loss per share of $0.04 on revenue of $11.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger presents chips with a new production technology. (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nThis quarter will also mark the first time Intel reports earnings under its new corporate structure. In April, the company said it will now report revenue from its Client Computing Group, Data Center and AI, and Network and Edge divisions under its Intel Products segment. Altera, Mobileye, and Other will now report under the All Other Segment, while Intel’s Foundry business will report under Intel Foundry.\n\nThe Foundry segment will report revenue from both producing Intel products as well as chips for third parties. In announcing the restructuring, however, Intel also revealed that its foundry business lost $7 billion in the last year.\n\nIntel is in the midst of transforming itself from a designer and manufacturer of its own chips to a manufacturer of chips for third-party clients. So far, the company has revealed Microsoft (MSFT) will be among its first customers, as the Windows maker looks to develop its own custom chips.\n\nThe move also puts Intel into direct competition with TSMC (TSM), the world's largest chip manufacturer. But there are doubts that the third-party foundry business will ever be a significant source of revenue.\n\n“The new disclosure may tease a [some of all parts]-based valuation that implies hidden value for its foundry efforts, but we remain sober as so much of the profitability improvement is parked in the 2027+ timeframe and it appears even in 2030 that Intel will still be a ~75% customer of Intel Foundry,” UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a recent research note.\n\nDuring Intel’s prior quarter earnings call, CFO David Zinsner said the company expects to see revenue for its Data Center and AI business decline by a double-digit percentage sequentially in Q1. At the time, however, CEO Pat Gelsinger said such a drop is fairly seasonal quarter to quarter. Still, with Nvidia’s AI sales through the roof, Intel’s performance has left Wall Street wanting.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIntel is also looking to capitalize on the AI craze through the PC market with its new Core Ultra processors. The chips, which feature built-in neural processing units (NPUs), are designed to run AI models on your laptop, rather than in the cloud. The idea is that you can take advantage of AI apps without having to connect to the web or share your data.\n\nAMD, Intel’s chief rival in the PC space, is also offering its own AI PC chips, while Nvidia says laptops running its chips are considered AI PCs as well. And on Wednesday, Qualcomm debuted its Snapdragon X Plus chip to go along with its previously announced Snapdragon X Elite as potential rivals to Intel and AMD.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) claims its chips can outpace certain Intel Core Ultra and AMD chips in terms of performance and battery life. The company’s new processors will go on sale later this year.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Reuters) - A group of Chinese chip companies led by Huawei Technologies and backed by the country's government aims to produce high-bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors, a key component in AI chips by 2026, The Information reported on Thursday.\n\nThe project, part of China's efforts to provide home-grown alternatives to Nvidia's AI chips, started last year and includes Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a memory chip maker under U.S. sanctions along with Huawei, according to the report.\n\nThe group also relies on other Chinese chip producers and packaging technology developers and it will work to tailor its memory chips to Huawei-designed AI processor chips and supporting motherboard components, the report said.\n\nHuawei and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nChina has in recent years poured investment into its domestic chip industry to reduce its dependence on foreign technology and overcome U.S. export curbs that limit its access to advanced semiconductors including Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nWhile HBM chips are not directly under U.S. restrictions on exports, they are made using American chip technology that Huawei is barred from accessing as part of the curbs.\n\nThe Information reported that the Huawei-led consortium had built at least two HBM production lines, using memory chips from different companies, in a form of internal competition. It added that Huawei would likely be the largest buyer of the HBMs.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.94 a share, just five days from its upcoming earnings release on April 30, 2024.\n\nSMCI has an Earnings ESP figure of 16.35%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.94 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.97.\n\nSMCI is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Nvidia (NVDA) as well.\n\nNvidia, which is readying to report earnings on May 22, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.63 a share, and NVDA is 27 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nNvidia's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.5% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49.\n\nSMCI and NVDA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

By integrating Run:ai's capabilities into NVIDIA's offerings, customers can expect improved efficiency, better management of GPU infrastructure and enhanced flexibility in deploying AI workloads.\n\nNVIDIA plans to continue offering Run:ai's products under the same business model and invest in the platform's roadmap. This integration will further bolster NVIDIA's DGX Cloud, an AI platform designed in collaboration with leading cloud providers, offering enterprises an integrated, full-stack solution optimized for generative AI.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA's acquisition of Run:ai reinforces its position as a leader in AI computing and underscores its dedication to delivering cutting-edge solutions that address the evolving needs of enterprises in the AI space.\n\nAcquisitions Drive Growth\n\nNVIDIA's growth trajectory is significantly bolstered by strategic acquisitions, exemplified by its recent agreement to acquire Run:ai, a Kubernetes-based workload management and orchestration software provider. This acquisition is a testament to NVIDIA's commitment to enhancing its AI computing capabilities and strengthening its position in the rapidly evolving AI market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAcquisitions have been a key driver of NVIDIA's growth strategy, enabling the company to expand its product offerings, enter new markets and enhance its technological capabilities. By integrating innovative technologies and talent from acquired companies, NVIDIA continues to strengthen its competitive advantage and address the evolving needs of its customers. Over the last five years, the company has acquired five key businesses — Mellanox Technologies, SwiftStack, OmniML, Excelero and Bright Computing.\n\nNVIDIA's focus on strategic acquisitions reflects its commitment to innovation and its proactive approach to meeting the demands of an increasingly complex AI landscape. As the AI market continues to expand, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and maintain its leadership position through strategic acquisitions that drive innovation and fuel long-term growth.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Vertiv, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 25, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Vertiv VRT, Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.\n\nBuying Opportunity? AI Infrastructure Stock Crushes Earnings\n\nVertiv, a global provider of critical digital infrastructure including data center and related systems management reported strong quarterly earnings results this morning, sending the stock to new all-time highs.\n\nVertiv stock has gone on an incredible run over the past year, as investors realized the key role Vertiv would play in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nEven with the incredible stock price appreciation Vertiv has experienced over the last year, it still boasts a reasonable valuation, and a long runway of growth ahead of it. Furthermore, with a top Zacks Rank, it also enjoys increased odds of rallying further in the near future.\n\nCritical AI and Digital Infrastructure\n\nAs we'll cover in the earnings results below, the growth in generative AI has been a significant boon to Vertiv's business and shows no evidence of slowing.\n\nThe company currently sits in an extremely strategic position within the AI boom, a very encouraging development for shareholders. Here is how Vertiv aids the technological revolution:\n\nHigh-Density Power and Cooling Solutions: The ever-growing processing power of AI requires robust power and cooling infrastructure. Vertiv's data center solutions are designed to handle the intense heat generated by AI workloads, ensuring optimal performance and preventing overheating. Technical Partnerships: Vertiv actively collaborates with leading AI chipmakers like Nvidia. These partnerships ensure their solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique power and cooling demands of cutting-edge AI hardware. End-to-End Expertise: Vertiv doesn't just provide individual components. They offer comprehensive solutions that manage power delivery and heat rejection from the power grid all the way to the individual chip. This holistic approach streamlines AI infrastructure deployment and optimizes performance. Global Reach and Scalability: The AI revolution is happening worldwide. Vertiv's global presence allows them to support the growing demand for data center infrastructure across different regions. Their scalable solutions can adapt to the ever-increasing power and cooling needs of AI applications.\n\nIn terms of AI-adjacent stocks to own, Vertiv is easily one of the best verticals to be positioned in.\n\nEarnings Results\n\nVertiv reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024 beating estimates for both sales and earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrganic orders increased by 60% compared to the same period last year and net sales reached $1,639 million, marking an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2023. Operating profit for the quarter was $203 million, while adjusted operating profit stood at $249 million, reflecting a significant year-over-year growth of 42%.\n\nThe company also began returning cash to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 9.1 million shares at an average price of $66 per share, which was very well timed as the stock is considerably higher today.\n\nAdditionally, Vertiv raised its full-year 2024 guidance, expecting net sales growth of 12% at the midpoint, along with increased operating profit and adjusted operating profit. The company attributes its strong performance to robust demand, particularly in AI-driven deployments and liquid cooling technologies, positioning Vertiv for continued growth and operational improvement in the evolving digital infrastructure landscape.\n\nIs Vertiv a Buy?\n\nBased on its importance to the AI ecosystem, its top Zacks Rank and reasonable valuation, I think Vertiv makes for a compelling stock to consider investing in.\n\nReflecting upward trending earnings revisions, it currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Next quarter earnings have been revised higher by 3.5% and next year's earnings have been increased by 5.5% over the last two months.\n\nToday, Vertiv has a one year forward earnings multiple of 33.5x, which is well above its two-year median of 21x and below the industry average of 36.9x. While this isn't a discount valuation it certainly isn't too expensive considering how important the products and services are to the AI boom.\n\nAdditionally, it is forecasting EPS to grow 26.7% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nOther AI Stocks to Consider\n\nOver the last couple of weeks some of the leading technology and AI-related stocks have sold off considerably with many down as much as 10%-20%. Two of the leading names in AI jump out to me.\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are both on sale at current levels. Of course, Nvidia is still the stock to own in the space, and even with its incredible price appreciation still has a very reasonable valuation sitting at 34x forward earnings.\n\nWith the immense demand sparked for products, Nvidia continues to see sales and earnings estimates revised higher, giving them a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\n\nAs one of the premium semiconductor producers, AMD also sits in an advantageous spot. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, and projects EPS to grow 25% annually over the next 3-5 years. AMD has also seen some hefty selling with the stock down more the -30% from its recent highs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor investors looking to add exposure to the AI and technology sector, Vertiv, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia all appear to be worth investment considerations. Thanks to the recent market selloff both AMD and Nvidia are off their highs, although Vertiv pushed to new all-time highs following the earnings report.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Grab Now to Ride the Artificial Intelligence Chip Boom to Riches",
        "content": "Data analytics company GlobalData projects that the AI market will grow 35% annually over the next few years, reaching $909 billion by 2030. Naturally, that’s made AI chip stocks extremely popular with investors.\n\nGoogle the words “AI chip stocks” in quotation marks, and you will get 39,600 results. AI is undoubtedly a priority subject for investors at the moment.\n\nOn April 1, Barron’s reported that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI plan to build a $100 billion AI data center, an investment equal to Microsoft’s capital spending over the past four years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are stocked because the AI chips required to power such a large data center would be enormous. That’s good news for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and every other major AI player.\n\nBank of America’s Global Research analyst Vivek Arya has buy ratings on Nvidia and four other AI chip stocks. I’d normally include Nvidia in any AI-related recommendation, but I’ll go with three that he does not mention in his article.\n\nTo make my selection, I looked at the Horizons Global Semiconductor Index ETF’s holdings, which trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Flag of the Republic of China or Taiwan on a processor, CPU Central processing Unit or GPU microchip on a motherboard. Taiwan manufacturing chip industry emerges as battlefront in US - China showdown. TSM stock\n\nSource: William Potter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ll admit that my picks aren’t the most original. However, that doesn’t make them any less actionable.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) makes the cut because of its commitment to American manufacturing. TSM is building an Arizona plant that will go live in 2025. The company also plans to start making its most advanced chips beginning in 2028. By 2030, it plans to open three fabrication plants in the U.S., which would cost the company $65 billion to get them up and running.\n\nNow, big business gets done with some help from the federal government, which is chipping in $11.6 billion in grants and loans. That pales compared to the nearly $20 billion being thrown Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) way under the CHIPS Act, intended to bring 20% of the world’s advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\nI’ve always thought globalization worked best when companies manufactured products in the country where the products are intended to be sold. Good for TSM.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs I write this, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) stock is falling. The Dutch chip maker reported weaker-than-expected sales in Q1 2024.\n\nAnalysts expected revenue of 5.39 billion euros ($5.73 billion), but ASML delivered 5.29 billion euros ($5.63 billion), 2% shy of the mark. However, its net income was 1.22 billion euros ($1.30 billion), 14% higher than Wall Street’s predictions.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML produces extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are used to make technologically advanced chips. Lower consumer demand for smartphones and laptops has had a knock-on effect on the company’s revenues. Sales and profits were down 21.6% and 37.4% in Q1 2024, respectively. Bookings were also down 4% year over year.\n\nDespite the miss, ASML reiterated its 2024 guidance for revenue. Similar to 2023, it suggests that 2025 will be its breakout year as both TSM and Intel increase their U.S. production.\n\n“I think by 2025 you will see all three of those coming together. New fab openings, strong secular trends and the industry in the midst of its upturn,” said CFO Roger Dassen in an interview for CNBC.\n\nASML is a buy below $900.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5G\n\nSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is up more than 19% year to date and more than 49% since November lows.\n\nQualcomm launched AI Hub in early March. It includes over 75 popular AI and generative AI language learning models such as Whisper, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion and Baichuan 7B, which will provide developers with high performance and low power consumption when creating applications.\n\nIn a February interview from the 2024 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala spoke with Yahoo Finance host Brad Smith about Qualcomm’s AI Hub’s role in generative AI.\n\n“And you could take those models, build it into an application, test it on a device, and deploy it into an application store, all in one go right at the website. So it just makes it very easy for the developers to take advantage of the hardware that we’ve put forward. And we’re excited that this broadens the reach of our products. And it makes it very easy for developers to access them.”\n\nSmartphone makers will launch devices with full AI capabilities integrated into them in 2024 and 2025. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip will help manufacturers deliver these capabilities.\n\nThis is a big positive for the company and its stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Maverick Tech Picks: 7 Stocks to Scoop Up While the Crowd Panics",
        "content": "Investors continue adjusting to the notion that interest rates may not come down as much as expected in 2024. That mindset shift is manifesting as something of a panic in the markets. As a result, contrarian tech stock picks are falling; the S&P 500 has fallen for five straight days as I write this.\n\nHowever, investors shouldn’t panic. Instead, I think there is an opportunity because while this April has been a difficult one, it’s historically one of the two strongest months for the stock market, along with December. That truth implies room for a rebound in the latter portions of this month.\n\nFurthermore, investors are more likely to adapt to the idea of higher rates for longer than they are to abandon the massive opportunity in artificial intelligence. To me, that suggests lower tech share prices are an opportunity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can’t understand why investors should logically be concerned about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  stock overall. I don’t have any precise statistics to back up this notion. However, buying Microsoft every time it drops 5% would be a winning strategy.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened between April 15 and April 19 — following my logic, that makes Microsoft a stock to scoop up while the crowd panics over rate cuts and rising Treasury yields.\n\nWhile Microsoft certainly meets those short-term criteria, the company’s long-term growth expoalm investors’ nerves. The value of the AI Tech Market was estimated at $200 billion in 2023. It is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion in value by 2030. Microsoft is one of the leading firms best exposed to that growth. That truth is evident in the 24% growth in its Cloud business during the most recent quarter. The company has invested massively in AI, especially in the business segment.\n\nThat brings me to my next point: the cloud. That particular market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 16.4% between 2024 and 2029. There, too, Microsoft is a leader.\n\nThe sky is not falling, and Microsoft will continue to appreciate.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf investors need reassurance about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, it can be found in the news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).\n\nInvestors are currently worried that markets may be amid a giant AI bubble. Combine that with the fact that rate cuts that would spur their growth may not now occur in 2024. The result is fear manifesting as exits from once red hot Nvidia shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing provides the perfect counterpoint to that notion. The world’s biggest foundry announced that first quarter revenue was boosted by demand for AI chips. Furthermore, the company noted that AI chips should account for 10% of overall revenue this year, rising to 20% by 2028.\n\nThat should be an immediate boon to Nvidia as it is the leading chip producer overall. Demand for its semiconductors should be expected to rise on the TSMC news. Based on TSMC forecasts, AI chip demand should double by 2028. That, too, should be a boon to Nvidia, although that longer time frame opens the door to competition. It’s logical to assume that other firms could erode Nvidia’s competitive advantage by 2028. The TSMC news should be enough to halt Nvidia’s downward trajectory for now.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe logic for Nvidia also applies to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and its stock. The crowd has panicked. AMD shares trade for $155 as I write this. They were trading as high as $211 five weeks ago. That sharp reversal is indicative of the fear that now dominates.\n\nYet, I would caution investors to ignore that fear based on the abovementioned information. Demand for AI chips is going to remain strong throughout 2024. TSMC produces roughly 50% of all AI chips, so its opinions are particularly pertinent. Its conviction that AI chip revenues will account for 10% of its business in 2024 is a strong vote of confidence for AMD and others.\n\nAMD is also currently engaged in a pitched battle against Nvidia to dominate AI chips. It remains a dark horse in the race but is also a firm with significant advantages, especially in pricing. TSMC Raised concerns about prices in that recent announcement. That’s important for AMD because the company produces chips at lower prices and a high value. If the market suddenly perceives value as a primary factor, then AMD will shoot up.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an excellent stock for several reasons. It is suffering, and prices have fallen as the crowd panicked over the last week. However, there are multiple reasons to remain optimistic about Amazon.\n\nFirstly, investors should have confidence in Amazon’s e-commerce business. The company continues to grow at a double-digit rate precisely because of its dominance over the e-commerce space. That’s the company’s main driver, and it will continue to grow. Amazon provides low-cost options that make it relevant for the next decade and beyond. Consumers will always want the lowest-cost option; it is as simple as that.\n\nYet, Amazon is so much more than e-commerce alone. In the most recent shareholder letter, Amazon management noted that the company is increasingly confident in Prime Video as a standalone business. Amazon is also developing its in-house chips, a big trend that every investor should follow at all major tech companies.\n\nAmazon has also invested $150 billion into AI data centers over the next 15 years. It isn’t easy to envision a future in which Amazon doesn’t continue to thrive.\n\nGoogle (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock perfectly exemplifies something I mentioned above about Amazon’s in-house chip development efforts.\n\nMost investors are well aware of the pushback against high chip prices from leading suppliers, including Nvidia. Big Tech is a major buyer of those chips. They can’t afford to pay those high prices because the war for AI computing power is in full swing.\n\nHowever, Google and others are unwilling to remain a captive audience for Nvidia indefinitely. Google has been developing AI chips for a decade. The company recently expanded its in-house chip development efforts. It’s crystal clear that Google aims to reduce its reliance on major chip makers. That’s true across all of big tech.\n\nGoogle understands what it needs in a chip best. At some point, it and other big tech firms may very well develop superior chips for their own purposes.\n\nWhile that proof probably doesn’t matter much about the current market panic, it’s one reason to consider scooping up Google.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is an excellent investment in general and particularly well-suited to the current market.\n\nThe company is an integral part of the AI supply chain and benefits from secular opportunities moving forward. Broadcom develops semiconductor infrastructure software. In everyday speech, the company helps chip firms derive greater power And AI output from a given chip.\n\nThat should position Broadcom to benefit for a long time as AI continues to develop. Currently, it manifests as a very strong fundamental. Top-line results increased by 34% in the most recent quarter.

However, it’s an excellent opportunity to pick up shares.\n\nThe same reason Micron has fallen so precipitously is the same reason that it previously rose so quickly. It’s also why you should remain steadfast as an investor or buy if you haven’t.\n\nMicron has been handpicked as a supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) by Nvidia. That was why it shot up so quickly in the last month.  The HBM market is dominated by Micron and two South Korean firms, Samsung and SK Hynix. Continued reshoring efforts should benefit Micron, and its current relationship with Nvidia is strong.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reassured the market that AI chip demand remains strong. In turn, Nvidia should continue to be strong, which, in turn, makes Micron strong as an integral supplier to Nvidia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Roar Higher This Year. My Top Growth Stock to Buy Before It Does.",
        "content": "The Nasdaq climbed to a new record high this year as investors piled into growth stocks, particularly those in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). This confirmed that the index was in a bull market, an investing environment favoring growth companies. And this momentum may just be getting started for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the AI market is in its early days, with analysts predicting a double-digit compound annual growth rate over the next few years and a market surpassing $1 trillion by 2030. Many companies aim to get in on the AI story to either streamline their own operations or sell AI products and services to others.\n\nThe desired result? A boost in earnings. Investors today and in the coming years want to get in on these growth stories, too, and that could lift these companies' shares, along with the Nasdaq.\n\nSecond, if history is a guide, the Nasdaq will roar higher this year. Since 2009, in the three growth periods following years of declines, the Nasdaq has advanced for at least two years. And in that second year, it scored double-digit gains.\n\nThis year, the Nasdaq has pared its earlier increase and is now up about 4.5% year to date. If history is right, the index could soar from this level. Here's my top growth stock to buy before it does. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvesting in AI\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI has been the key to stock market gains in recent times, and this trend is likely to continue, thanks to the long-term market outlook. Companies have a lot to gain by investing in AI today. This is terrific news for companies that produce the tools needed to unlock the power of this new technology. I'm talking about chip designers and makers of various key elements, like servers or workstations.\n\nMany of these companies are set to benefit, but one that should score the biggest win is top chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPU) have become the gold standard for training and inferencing, key tasks that power AI models so they can do their jobs of solving complex problems.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are mainly used by the video game industry. But seeing that their power to simultaneously process many tasks could be useful in other areas, Nvidia created CUDA, a parallel computing platform that allows GPUs to be used for general purposes, including AI. That created a huge shift at the company, and revenue linked to AI today is far surpassing revenue from the gaming business.\n\nAs a result, earnings have skyrocketed. In recent quarters, they've climbed in the triple digits, and over the past five years, earnings have advanced more than 900% to about $29 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's rival, Intel\n\nEven though Nvidia holds 80% of today's AI chip market, plenty of rivals eagerly are attempting to take away market share. For example, Intel recently announced the upcoming launch of its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, a chip that may outperform Nvidia's H100 on certain large language models.\n\nThough others likely will take some market share, I don't see this as a threat to Nvidia or a movement that will weigh on earnings growth over the long run because the company continues to innovate and bring the most powerful chips to market first. It recently announced the release (later this year) of its Blackwell architecture, including six major innovations, such as the world's most powerful chip. A chip from a competitor today may outperform Nvidia's chips right now, but this probably won't be the case once Blackwell enters the scene.\n\nNvidia's earnings growth and access to talent offer the company the resources it needs to continue innovating and staying ahead.\n\nToday, Nvidia shares, even after soaring 200% over the past year, trade for 32x forward earnings estimates -- which seems reasonable for a leader in such a high-growth market. And analysts predict 35% annual growth for the company over the coming five years.\n\nAll of this makes Nvidia look like a solid stock to buy right now. It also could help the Nasdaq roar higher this year and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,010!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Wall Street Winners: The 3 Biggest Analyst Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts are revisiting their rating calls in recent days and weeks amid the increase in market volatility, leading to some of the biggest analyst upgrades. While the S&P 500 remains comfortably in the green territory in 2024, the ongoing market pullback has forced analysts to rethink some of their recommendations to clients.\n\nThe pullback is part of a broader market correction influenced by various factors. Hotter-than-expected March inflation heightened worries about persistent inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions, possibly delaying a rate cut expected in June. Geopolitical tensions, notably between Israel and Iran, also drove investors towards safer assets, exacerbating the market’s downturn.\n\nWriting about the current market conditions, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) equity strategists noted that the recent market behavior resembled a “classic hedge fund de-grossing,” where there was significant selling in technology and momentum stocks, while traditionally higher-risk sectors like small caps saw unusual gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe banking giant indicated that current market conditions might not necessarily signal a shift to value and financial shares but rather a broader move to reduce risk. Wells Fargo also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding financial stocks, given a potentially less dovish Fed stance.\n\n“We have been surprised [by] equity volatility, and the VIX have been so well-behaved YTD, especially with rising rates and geopolitical risk,” added the bank. “Our late-2023 analysis suggested we would see a VIX spike in 1H24 and slight equity downside,” the strategists said in a note.\n\nAs equity prices move lower, Wall Street sell-side analysts tend to refresh their models and look for opportunities to upgrade their recommendations amid more attractive valuations. Here are the three biggest analyst upgrades from last week.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNeedham & Company analyst Laura Martin has upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and set a price target of $700.00 on the streaming giant’s stock, marking one of the biggest analyst upgrades recently. The analyst’s optimism is based on Netflix’s impressive first quarter 2024 performance, where it reported revenues of $9.4 billion, marking a 15% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Still, shares for Netflix fell after the earnings report following a soft guidance.\n\nOn a more positive note, Netflix’s subscriber base grew by 9.3 million, reaching 270 million, and its free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the quarter. As a result, Martin believes Netflix is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI, citing the company’s tech-first approach and global scale, which maximizes data value.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, anticipated price increases and accelerating advertising revenue are expected to spur revenue growth and expand margins. The analyst also noted that Netflix’s stable content spending, which remains around $17 billion, alongside its strategy to repurchase shares using its free cash flow instead of paying down debt, will likely result in free cash flow and return on invested capital surpassing estimates.\n\nEBay (EBAY) ebay app on a smartphone\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nEBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock received a strong boost last week after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts double-upgraded their recommendation to Overweight from Underweight. The price target on EBAY stock was nearly doubled to $62.00 per share.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s upgrade is grounded in the positive outlook on eBay’s strategic shift towards broader site-wide horizontal solutions and the integration of generative AI technologies, which analysts anticipate will enhance both Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and adjusted EBIT.\n\nSpecifically, the broker projects a CAGR of 1% for GMV and 5% for adjusted EBIT from 2023 to 2026. Moreover, they believe eBay’s return to positive FX-neutral GMV growth in a challenging economic environment will bolster investor confidence in the company’s medium-term growth potential, possibly materializing sooner than expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the double upgrade is the fact that despite having a growth profile similar to Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), eBay currently trades at about a 35% discount based on 2025 EV/EBITDA estimates. That valuation gap, according to Morgan Stanley, offers a compelling case for potential multiple expansion if eBay successfully executes its strategic initiatives.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nHSBC analysts upgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock from Hold to Buy, also raising the price target from $180.00 to $225.00. This is one of the biggest analyst upgrades and is based on enhanced earnings projections fueled by expected growth in AMD’s AI GPU revenue and improved performance across its non-AI segments.\n\nThe broker also adjusted the 2024 and 2025 EPS estimates upwards by 7% and 25%, respectively, resulting in new forecasts of $4.08 for 2024 and $7.43 for 2025. These revised estimates are significantly above the consensus, by 13% for 2024 and 31% for 2025.\n\nAnalysts said their latest move reflects the confidence in AMD gaining a 10% market share by 2025 and capitalizing on competitor Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) anticipated product transitions in the AI GPU space during 2024. Furthermore, HSBC suggests that under a bullish scenario for AMD’s AI GPU business, there could be a further 16% upside potential to his already elevated 2025 EPS estimate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: April Edition",
        "content": "Semiconductors remain a red hot field of technology. Market analyst Charlie Bilello pointed out in a recent blog post that the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) has outperformed every other industry group over the last decade, rising 10x. The Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index is up 4.3x in the last 10 years, while leading gold and energy ETFs have each increased 1.5x. Bilello calls the move higher in semiconductors relative to the broader market “parabolic.”\n\nClearly, semiconductors are a good place to invest and an area of the market where investors are likely to find multibagger stocks, defined as securities that provide a return of 100% or more. Also known as stocks that double their share price on multiple occasions. So, which are the best semiconductor stocks to buy now? What companies are red hot and likely to double their share price? Here are three multibagger semiconductor stocks in the making.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s a buying opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) right now after the leading semiconductor’s share price has pulled back 15% in the past month. It’s a rare drawdown that investors should take advantage of, especially as the company pushes further into artificial intelligence (AI) with new chip models. At the end of last year, the company launched a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by more than 50%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEarlier last fall, AMD’s new MI300X accelerator microchip went on sale. That chip is used in data centers and servers and is meant to compete with rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI data center chips. Sales of both the Ryzen 8040 and MI300X are only now showing up in AMD’s earnings reports, the next of which is scheduled for April 30. Last autumn, AMD said it expected $2 billion in AI chip sales in 2024. The company more recently revised that figure up to $3.5 billion of AI chip sales this year.\n\nDespite the recent drawdown, AMD’s share price has risen 445% over the last five years, making it a potential multibagger semiconductor stock.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish on shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now. AVGO stock currently has a strong buy rating with an average price per share that is 26% higher than current levels. In fact, the lowest price target on Broadcom’s stock is 15% higher than where the shares currently trade. There are no sell ratings on the stock. Analysts expect that Broadcom will benefit in coming months and years as the AI revolution goes into overdrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother strength of Broadcom’s is diversification. The company is more than an AI play. Its semiconductors are used in sectors ranging from networking and broadband to wireless communications and industrial applications. The diversification helps to insulate Broadcom from economic cycles. AVGO stock has dipped 8% in the last month after the company issued forward guidance that failed to impress Wall Street. However, the company conservatively guides its operations. Over five years, the stock is up 300%.\n\nAstera Labs (ALAB) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. semiconductor company Astera Labs Inc. (ALAB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s still early, but Astera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) has potential to become a multibagger semiconductor stock. The company held its initial public offering (IPO) on March 20 and it has been a resounding success. Since its market debut a month ago, ALAB stock has gained 16% and shares have not pulled back or fallen below their IPO price. Initial analyst coverage of Astera Labs has been bullish. The company makes semiconductor-based connectivity products and operates at the center of AI infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts also like that Astera Labs counts both Nvidia and AMD among its customers. While the company remains unprofitable, its finances are moving in the right direction. Astera Labs reported a net loss of $26.3 million in 2023, an improvement over a $58.3 million loss in 2022. Sales are growing rapidly too, rising 45% year-over-year in 2023 to $115.8 million. The company now has 10 analysts following it who have given ALAB stock a consensus rating of strong buy and a price target that’s 18% above current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is America’s longest-running major stock index. Founded in 1896, the Dow Jones serves as a trusted gauge of America’s leading companies.\n\nMany investors and analysts have switched to other preferred indexes, such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100. However, the Dow’s tradition, long price and chart history, and different mix of constituent components make it a worthwhile metric in the 21st century.\n\nWhile the Dow Jones only has 30 holdings, it manages to have a great mix of companies representing almost all major sectors of the American economy. And given this diversification, there have been several Dow stocks that have taken a tumble so far in 2024, even while overall markets have been strong.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis gives investors the ability to do some bargain-shopping. These are three leading Dow stocks to buy now that are available at a sizable discount from their recent price levels.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nLeading the way, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares are down a shocking 35% year-to-date. That’s a huge amount for a blue-chip industrial company such as Boeing.\n\nHowever, the company has certainly had its fair share of problems. Boeing planes were involved in fatal crashes in both 2018 and 2019. More recently, a variety of Boeing planes have run into high-profile mechanical issues while in flight. The Boeing 737 MAX program, in particular, appears to have serious technical issues which will require major remediation efforts.\n\nThere is good reason for concern. Not only is the company facing legal issues and major repair bills, it has also dramatically tarnished its reputation.\n\nThat said, BA stock is down from a peak of more than $400/share to just $170 today. Our David Moadel recently suggested that Boeing’s worst-case scenario is overblown, and that it is time to bet against the bears.\n\nAt the end of the day, Boeing has an effective duopoly with Airbus. Boeing is a massive employer across the U.S., and it’s also a huge supplier to the military. Given the national security angle, it’s not in anyone’s interest for Boeing to fail. As the company brings in new management, look for the tide to turn and for this American manufacturing giant to recover from its doldrums.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another Dow stock that is in the penalty box right now, with INTC stock down 31% year-to-date.\n\nThe company has struggled to keep up with rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in key markets. Intel has also not been at the forefront of the all-important artificial intelligence chip trend, letting Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) run away with exciting new product categories.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is barely profitable right now, and investors are fearing the worst. However, Intel has a secret weapon — its long-term investment program.\n\nIntel is pouring tens of billions of dollars into new semiconductor foundry capacity. This should make it a credible competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), and greatly diversify its revenue streams. These investments will take years to play out, and as such aren’t reflected in the firm’s current or forward P/E ratios. But, over time, the reward of this disciplined investment approach should pay off.\n\nAs a kicker, the U.S. government is giving Intel generous support for this domestic manufacturing program. Specifically, Intel is set to receive $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans to help advance its massive new chip manufacturing facilities.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) shares are also down double-digits year-to-date. The apparel giant has seen its sales velocity slow in key markets such as China. Inventories have also mounted, and analysts are worried about profit margins going forward.\n\nThese are certainly real near-term concerns. However, investors shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that consumer discretionary companies such as Nike tend to be cyclical in nature. And, after several years of record consumer spending, it’s not surprising that people are pulling back a bit. High inflation and a shifting macroeconomic landscape are making many people pinch pennies.\n\nHowever, Nike is hardly the only consumer products company currently facing a slump. Look at other categories such as luxury goods, spirits, or cosmetics and things are similarly downcast at the moment.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Nike’s celebrity endorsements, global brand, and powerful distribution channels give it the sticking power to make it through this downturn and come out stronger.\n\nIn the meantime, Nike is laying off employees and trimming costs to maintain its profitability until the apparel industry turns things around. And the last earnings report was better than expected, suggesting that the company’s trajectory is already set to bounce back.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in INTC and NKE stock.

        "title": "From Cryptocurrency to Cannabis: 7 Penny Stocks on the Rise",
        "content": "Penny stocks tend to be volatile, illiquid and (in many cases) poor companies with limited financial standing and worse long-term outlooks. But that isn’t always the case, especially with penny stocks on the rise.\n\nPenny stocks saw per-share pricing drop further than expected in 2023, with ETFs like the iShares Micro-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:IWC) dropping 2% compared to the wider market’s respectable 7% return since Jan. 1. That may be changing, though, as rate cut prospects, combined with the “worst in class” penny stocks being squeezed, combine to make today’s remaining micro-cap top contenders in their category.\n\nThe best part about penny stock investing is that you can diversify holdings across a range of sectors, geographies, business types, and more — creating a bespoke, customized portfolio best suited to your unique needs. Here are a few of the top penny stocks on the rise you may want to consider today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBit Digital (BTBT) Bit Digital (BTBT stock): several rows of processors in a crypto mining farm.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nStarting from the cryptocurrency side of penny stocks on the rise, Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) is a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining stock priced far cheaper than well-known alternatives like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). The company’s mining units number in the tens of thousands, and to date, they’ve mined more than 6,600 Bitcoins (worth more than $430 million at today’s pricing). That’s a drop in the bucket compared to mega-miners like Riot, which has mined about the same amount in 2023 alone. To offset the disparity, Bit Digital is also diversifying sales streams by leaning into AI-centric infrastructure.\n\nBit Digital AI is Bit Digital’s new business line, which “provides[s] specialized infrastructure to support generative artificial intelligence workstreams.”\n\nIn other words, Bit Digital is deploying a suite of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) units in a high-end data center to help smaller companies access greater artificial intelligence utility by offering multiple computing power access points.\n\nTo me, this is the future of digital crypto mining: whether due to regulation or cost-prohibitiveness, as mining becomes pricier, these companies will increasingly use their vast computing power to solve peripheral problems. And Bit Digital is a penny stock leading the charge into the emerging paradigm.\n\nDestination XL Group (DXLG) A hand reaches for an article of clothing on a hanger from a rack labeled XL.\n\nSource: christinarosepix / Shutterstock.com\n\nDestination XL Group (NASDAQ:DXLG) stands out among penny stocks as a longstanding retailer with a proven business model and operational success. The company specializes in “big and tall” men’s clothing and has experienced a slight sales slump throughout 2023. However, it’s not enough to justify its current valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Destination XL posted fourth-quarter and end-of-year results with adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share for the quarter and 50 cents for the year. Although these figures marked a 16% and 20% drop, respectively, from the previous year, the company’s 10.7% EBITDA margin remains impressive. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, sending shares down about 10% post-earnings.\n\nThis dip has brought the stock to a very appealing 6x price-to-earnings ratio and a share price of just 0.42x sales. Moreover, the company’s effective cash management has allowed it to remain debt-free and maintain high buyback levels. With a total yield of 12.52%, Destination XL Group is a compelling penny stock on the rise.\n\nLithium Americas (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) ranks among the top penny stocks on the rise this year, despite a sluggish lithium market. However, trends could reverse in 2024, potentially catapulting this Argentinian-focused mining stock. Demand for lithium, driven largely by batteries and renewable energy transitions, is expected to surge more than 30% annually through 2030.\n\nLike other lithium producers, Lithium Americas encountered slow demand and a significant oversupply in 2023, which depressed spot prices. But demand is accelerating, and some analysts predict an imminent undersupply, likely pushing spot prices upward and benefiting Lithium Americas.\n\nMore importantly, Argentinia’s new president, Javier Milei, is sparking bullish sentiment about the lithium-rich region’s mining potential, as he wants to reduce hurdles for mining operations and recently spoke to Elon Musk about the issue (lithium, of course, being a critical component in EV production).\n\nWith the stock trading below its book value and at a lower price-to-forward earnings ratio than in recent years, Lithium Americas is a unique commodity penny stock set to surge as markets realign.\n\nDesktop Metal (DM) A concept image of a penny sitting on a stock chart\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nDesktop Metal (NYSE:DM) is a surging penny stock. The 3D-printing stock climbed over 15% since Jan. 1. Despite trading below previous highs, the penny stock is poised to broaden its market reach by targeting new audience segments with substantial growth potential.\n\nDesktop Metal’s healthcare-focused subsidiary, Desktop Health, has rolled out an expansive initiative called ScanUp aimed at dental professionals. This move capitalizes on the fact that “half of the dentists in the United States have not yet adopted intraoral scanning,” representing a significant untapped market, as noted in a company press release. The ScanUp platform requires a 36-month commitment and promises to generate more predictable, recurring revenue for the small-cap 3D-printing penny stock.\n\nClosing out 2023, Desktop Metal notably reduced its net loss to $323.4 million from $740.3 million the previous year. Although it is still on the path to profitability, Desktop Metal presents a high-risk but potentially high-reward penny stock investment opportunity within the expanding 3D-printing sector.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) Pennies in a jar on top of a background of blurred pennies. Penny stocks.\n\nSource: John Brueske / Shutterstock\n\nA few weeks ago, I briefly examinedThe Metals Company (NASDAQ:TMC) from a legislation perspective, theorizing that GreenTech initiatives might benefit the deep-sea metals mining firm. However, renewed Federal interest in sourcing essential metals and minerals from the ocean is not the only factor buoying this penny stock.\n\nThe company recently added Steve Jurvetson as Vice Chairman and “special advisor” to the CEO. Jurvetson’s track record includes early investments and board roles at SpaceX, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Planet Labs (NYSE:PL), among others. Although relying solely on one individual to turn a company around is risky, Jurvetson’s experience nurturing small, speculative companies could significantly impact this deep-sea mining penny stock.\n\nA current concern for The Metals Company is its burn rate—deep-sea mining exploration is expensive and slow to yield results. The company currently has enough cash and credit to sustain its operations for approximately another year. However, with Jurvetson’s appointment, expect strategic investment opportunities to surface soon, as he may begin leveraging his Silicon Valley connections for potential capital influx.\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) Stacks of pennies representing penny stocks. Nano-Cap Penny Stocks\n\nSource: John Brueske / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnovix Corporation (NASDAQ:ENVX), an energy-centric penny stock, is leading the charge in cutting-edge battery technology. Unlike prominent battery producers like Tesla, which shifted their lithium-ion batteries away from rare earth materials while maintaining the basic battery structure, Enovix is revolutionizing the entire concept.\n\nThe company produces 3D silicone lithium-ion batteries, which are inherently more scalable and suitable for high-capacity applications such as smartphones and tech wearables. Enovix demonstrated this capability with two significant achievements recently. First, the company obtained FDA approval to include its batteries in vital sign monitors, such as blood pressure and heart rate monitors. Soon after, Enovix secured a major contract with the US Army to supply batteries for next-generation military wearables, thus integrating 21st-century technology into soldiers’ toolkits.\n\nAlthough still focused on R&D, Enovix’s recent victories suggest a rapid acceleration as the company begins marketing its innovative batteries.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, on the cannabis stock side of the penny stocks spectrum, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is a leading competitor thanks partly to German legalization efforts opening new global market opportunities for cannabis stocks. The stock surged 26% in just a few days, a spike that rapidly reverted to early 2024 per-share pricing after the hype slowed.\n\nLooking at broader sector-specific trends, the outlook strengthens further. U.S. legislators continue to advocate for rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, though full legalization remains off the table for now. Even a slight federal relaxation of cannabis regulations could trigger a broad increase in cannabis stock prices. In the meantime, Tilray has a unique advantage that buffers against potential setbacks.\n\nOwning 5% of the national craft beer market provides Tilray with a critical lifeline while awaiting U.S. legalization and enhances profitability in regions where cannabis is legal despite thin profit margins. Additionally, Tilray’s acquisition of Anheuser-Busch’s (NYSE:BUD) craft beer division included valuable marketing, distribution, and compliance expertise—assets that will distinctly benefit Tilray as legal environments evolve.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Vertiv VRT, a global provider of critical digital infrastructure including data center and related systems management reported strong quarterly earnings results this morning, sending the stock to new all-time highs.\n\nVertiv stock has gone on an incredible run over the past year, as investors realized the key role Vertiv would play in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nEven with the incredible stock price appreciation Vertiv has experienced over the last year, it still boasts a reasonable valuation, and a long runway of growth ahead of it. Furthermore, with a top Zacks Rank, it also enjoys increased odds of rallying further in the near future. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCritical AI and Digital Infrastructure\n\nAs we’ll cover in the earnings results below, the growth in generative AI has been a significant boon to Vertiv’s business and shows no evidence of slowing.\n\nThe company currently sits in an extremely strategic position within the AI boom, a very encouraging development for shareholders. Here is how Vertiv aids the technological revolution:\n\nHigh-Density Power and Cooling Solutions: The ever-growing processing power of AI requires robust power and cooling infrastructure. Vertiv's data center solutions are designed to handle the intense heat generated by AI workloads, ensuring optimal performance and preventing overheating. Technical Partnerships: Vertiv actively collaborates with leading AI chipmakers like Nvidia. These partnerships ensure their solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique power and cooling demands of cutting-edge AI hardware. End-to-End Expertise: Vertiv doesn't just provide individual components. They offer comprehensive solutions that manage power delivery and heat rejection from the power grid all the way to the individual chip. This holistic approach streamlines AI infrastructure deployment and optimizes performance. Global Reach and Scalability: The AI revolution is happening worldwide. Vertiv's global presence allows them to support the growing demand for data center infrastructure across different regions. Their scalable solutions can adapt to the ever-increasing power and cooling needs of AI applications.\n\nIn terms of AI-adjacent stocks to own, Vertiv is easily one of the best verticals to be positioned in.\n\nEarnings Results\n\nVertiv reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024 beating estimates for both sales and earnings.\n\nOrganic orders increased by 60% compared to the same period last year and net sales reached $1,639 million, marking an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2023. Operating profit for the quarter was $203 million, while adjusted operating profit stood at $249 million, reflecting a significant year-over-year growth of 42%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also began returning cash to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 9.1 million shares at an average price of $66 per share, which was very well timed as the stock is considerably higher today.\n\nAdditionally, Vertiv raised its full-year 2024 guidance, expecting net sales growth of 12% at the midpoint, along with increased operating profit and adjusted operating profit. The company attributes its strong performance to robust demand, particularly in AI-driven deployments and liquid cooling technologies, positioning Vertiv for continued growth and operational improvement in the evolving digital infrastructure landscape.\n\nIs Vertiv a Buy?\n\nBased on its importance to the AI ecosystem, its top Zacks Rank and reasonable valuation, I think Vertiv makes for a compelling stock to consider investing in.\n\nReflecting upward trending earnings revisions, it currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Next quarter earnings have been revised higher by 3.5% and next year’s earnings have been increased by 5.5% over the last two months.\n\nToday, Vertiv has a one year forward earnings multiple of 33.5x, which is well above its two-year median of 21x and below the industry average of 36.9x. While this isn’t a discount valuation it certainly isn’t too expensive considering how important the products and services are to the AI boom.\n\nAdditionally, it is forecasting EPS to grow 26.7% annually over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther AI Stocks to Consider\n\nOver the last couple of weeks some of the leading technology and AI-related stocks have sold off considerably with many down as much as 10%-20%. Two of the leading names in AI jump out to me.\n\nNvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD are both on sale at current levels. Of course, Nvidia is still the stock to own in the space, and even with its incredible price appreciation still has a very reasonable valuation sitting at 34x forward earnings.\n\nWith the immense demand sparked for products, Nvidia continues to see sales and earnings estimates revised higher, giving them a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\n\nAs one of the premium semiconductor producers, AMD also sits in an advantageous spot. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, and projects EPS to grow 25% annually over the next 3-5 years. AMD has also seen some hefty selling with the stock down more the -30% from its recent highs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor investors looking to add exposure to the AI and technology sector, Vertiv, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia all appear to be worth investment considerations. Thanks to the recent market selloff both AMD and Nvidia are off their highs, although Vertiv pushed to new all-time highs following the earnings report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "The semiconductor trade lost a great of its luster in recent weeks, with some of the top names in the space (including the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)) showing immense weakness after many quarters of remarkable gains. Undoubtedly, the technical backdrop does not look too pretty in April 2024, especially for those just in the names to make a quick buck. That said, I do think that over the long haul, this negative turning point for semis and the rest of tech may not be as horrid as it seems today. That’s why you should consider these semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nWith NVDA and AMD stocks bouncing back on an upbeat Tuesday, it will be interesting to see where the two AI chip leaders steer the rest of the tech scene and markets as a whole. Buying this Spring-time dip will certainly not be pain-free. However, those who still believe their long-term growth stories are underappreciated may find the “buy the dip” mentality may pay off.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the relatively lukewarm semiconductor stocks out there, with shares still more than two years off their all-time highs. Undoubtedly, QCOM stock may finally experience its breakout moment should it unveil some better-than-expected numbers come its May 1, 2024 earnings report. With momentum starting to turn against the tech as a whole, though, the numbers and guidance had better be good.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEither way, Qualcomm has plenty of newly unveiled hardware to capitalize on the AI race, especially if demand for PCs, specifically AI-capable PCs, looks to kick off a new bull market. While I don’t expect a lockdown-era PC demand surge, I do think things will get very interesting as PC makers sell prospective customers on edge computing.\n\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite PC chip could gain significantly if PC sales are in for another AI-induced jolt. And on the front of AI-capable smartphones, Qualcomm also stands to gain with its impressive new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\n\nEither way, an edge transition means big things for Qualcomm as it looks to rise to become one of the next major movers of the AI chip scene.\n\nThough I have no idea if 2024 will see an edge AI boom, I do think AI innovations will eventually start inching toward the edge as hardware becomes more capable. You can see why we are excited about these semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nYou don’t need to be a GPU maker to benefit from the rise of AI. Wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) firm Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) also play a vital role in the boom. Lam has also been doing quite well over the past year supporting the semiconductor firms, most notably the memory chip makers, as they ramp up their production capacity to meet rising AI hardware demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I view Lam as still relatively underappreciated, at least compared to the firms pulling the curtain on their best and brightest AI accelerators. At the time of writing, the stock goes for 23.8 times forward price-to-earnings, which isn’t all too unreasonable.\n\nNot all analysts are upbeat on LRCX stock for the year, though. Deutsche Bank is one of the skeptics, downgrading shares to neutral back in December 2023, noting that a “robust memory capex recovery in 2025” may already be priced in.\n\nWith mild expectations from some analysts, perhaps Lam Research may have more room to impress following its impressive third-quarter guidance calling for sales to come in the $3.4-4.0 billion range, up from $3.69 billion.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock is another modestly-priced semiconductor company that may have underappreciated upside over the coming years. Shares have been fluctuating in a rather wide consolidation channel since plunging back in early 2022.\n\nWith shares in consolidation mode, TXN stock looks rather untimely for most upside-seeking investors, even after its latest first-quarter earnings, which came in ahead of expectations. Despite the better-than-expected quarter, management noted of revenue declines “across all end markets.”\n\nDespite softening broad-based demand, the company seems well-equipped to benefit as AI shifts closer to the edge. Products like the Edge AI Studio lower the barriers to designing AI models on the back of the company’s hardware.\n\nIndeed, many Texas Instrument components are in the devices we use regularly. Such components may not be the “brain” of the device, but nevertheless, they are vital to its functioning as more consumers place more value on the AI capabilities of their own hardware. Make the right play and invest in these semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Other significant purchasers include Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Google, and Amazon, each reportedly acquiring 50,000 chips. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon nearly account for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. CNBC writes.\n\nMusk had mocked Nvidia’s substantial market capitalization loss on April 19, calling the 10% stock decline “rookie numbers” on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNvidia experienced a significant drop in stock value, shedding $211 billion in market capitalization, marking the second-largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThis steep decline was triggered by disappointing earnings from ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and a pessimistic market outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nMeanwhile, analysts maintained their bullish stance on Nvidia, expecting it to rule the accelerator market primarily backed by its Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 205% in the last 12 months.

The leading semiconductor company known for its CPUs and GPUs delivered a 10% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, reaching a high of $6.20 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the increase was largely fueled by record sales in the data center segment amid solid demand for the company's Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs. Data center revenue for the quarter was up 38% to $2.30 billion, underscoring the company's competitive edge in this critical and growing market.\n\nAMD's stellar performance affirms its strategic positioning and long-term prospects because the semiconductor industry is focused on data centers and AI applications. According to the CEO Lisa Su, the strong demand positions the company for significant growth as artificial intelligence reshapes the computing market.\n\nMoreover, robust revenue growth remains the catalyst behind the company's improved financial performance. Its net income in the fourth quarter increased by about 3,000% to $667 million from just $21 million in the same quarter last year. Net income growth was bolstered by the 38% growth in data center revenue as the company also managed its operational expenses, effectively coming in at $6.60 billion compared to $6 billion in the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, profitability has improved significantly amid the AI frenzy that has triggered strong demand for the company's chips. Hence, AMD has bounced to profitability of 18 cents and 41 cents per share over the past two quarters, while gross margins improved to 47% from 43%, driven by robust revenue growth. AI Is Powering AMD's Future\n\nStrategic play to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI GPU market\n\nAI is evolving at a breakneck pace, becoming an area that has turned into a battlefield for semiconductor magnates. And that's happening right in the niche of AI GPUs, meaning graphics processing units designed for the ever-more sophisticated and specialized purposes of AI.\n\nThe MI300X AI GPU is a major leap for AMD in its effort to seize market share that is currently held by Nvidia, especially in competition with the latter's H100 chip. The company's strategy is competitive pricing, technological innovation and a more intensified software ecosystem to be a very strong player. AI Is Powering AMD's Future\n\nSource: AMD\n\nBreaking the price barrier\n\nA key aspect of AMD's approach is its pricing strategy for the MI300X AI GPU. Widely anticipated to come in at under $40,000, it would present a more budget-friendly option than Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\nIt is, therefore, expected that this strategic pricing will really lower the barriers for companies and research institutions keen on delving into AI model development, where advanced AI computing can be accessible by a larger audience.\n\nBy undercutting Nvidia on price, AMD targets users that are looking for high-performance computing solutions, but not at a premium price point.\n\nThe new frontier in AI computing: Revolutionary architecture and enhanced software ecosystem\n\nThe very heart of the MI300X is potentially game-changing architecture, driving AMD's challenge to Nvidia with big upgrades over the H100.\n\nThe 192GB of HBM3 memory packed inside the MI300X suggests AMD is pushing into high-performance memory technology with faster data transfers; this is also key to supporting more powerful, bigger and increasingly sophisticated AI models.\n\nThat would underline MI300 as the fastest in reaching $1 billion in sales for a chipset and signal the lightning-fast market expectation on the product's adoption and readiness for a competitive alternative to Nvidia's offerings. This was reflected in the development very positively; it was an affirmation of the technological leadership of the product and the thrust in strategic marketing by AMD.\n\nNow that the AI GPU supremacy battle is fought on more than hardware grounds, AMD has made a substantial update to its ROCm software suite. The move speaks directly to one of the largest barriers to changing GPU suppliers: the software ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's CUDA has been the dominant standard in GPU-accelerated computing, effectively checking the inflow for any competitor. By enhancing the capabilities of the ROCm ecosystem, AMD is really taking on not only the hardware domain of Nvidia, but also software dominance, making the migration or development of AI-based projects on AMD GPUs much more developer-friendly.\n\nFinally, according to tech expert Markus Schaal, AMD is challenging Nvidia's stronghold in the AI GPU market with its MI300X, which outperforms Nvidia's A100 GPU by more than 100% in FP32 workloads, offering a compelling advantage for AI and HPC applications. The company has significantly improved its ROCm software stack for AI, achieving near-parity with industry needs, enhancing compatibility with major AI frameworks and securing notable endorsements from tech leaders.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe all-encompassing approach by AMD to face off with Nvidia in the AI GPU market underlines a large degree of ambitious planning and what may change in the industry with regard to landscaping.\n\nBy providing a competitively priced product of top-notch quality and including the critical aspect of software support, AMD places itself as a vendor to be reckoned with in front of the established dominance of Nvidia. To challenge the company's deep-rooted dominance, AMD must combine aggressive marketing and continuous innovation with unwavering support from the developer community.\n\nThe AI GPU market is dynamic, with technological advancements and developer preferences constantly evolving. Success for AMD lies wholly in the current momentum it is maintaining in innovation, market penetration and ecosystem development to take on Nvidia, not as a technical powerhouse, but as a solutions provider for every aspect of AI.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmidst the AI boom and growing chip demand, AMD showcases resilience and strategic growth, even after a 20% pullback. Focused on expanding its presence in the data center and AI markets, AMD challenges leaders like Nvidia with key partnerships and ambitious sales targets.\n\nIts strong market position, supported by robust stock fundamentals and technological innovations, signals AMD's readiness to capitalize on AI and data center demands. This approach outlines AMD's strategic vision to navigate market shifts and stake a claim in the competitive semiconductor landscape, highlighting a promising path forward in the AI-driven era.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Qualcomm is coming for Intel’s biggest market: PCs",
        "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) is ramping up its efforts to win the AI PC race and heading for a collision course with Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD), with the debut of its new Arm-based (ARM) Snapdragon X Plus chip for Windows-based laptops. The company previously announced its more powerful Snapdragon X Elite for Windows laptops in October.\n\nThe chips, which Qualcomm says will be available sometime in mid-2024, are designed to take on Intel’s latest Core Ultra line of chips as well as Apple’s M3 chip lineup.\n\nThe X Elite features a 12-core Oryon central processing unit (CPU), onboard Adreno graphics processing unit (GPU), and Qualcomm’s Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU). The X Plus packs a 10-core CPU, a built-in GPU, and a similar Hexagon NPU as the X Elite. The chips can also be outfitted with up to 64GB of memory.\n\nQualcomm is marketing both sets of chips as AI powerhouses, saying that they offer the world’s fastest NPUs for laptops, which allows for better overall performance while running local generative AI applications.\n\nIn most cases, generative AI apps run on large data center servers that you access via the web. That’s great up until you don’t have an internet connection. The idea behind local AI apps is that you’re able to use them without needing to be online and your data stays on your device rather than on the internet.\n\nBut so far, there haven’t been too many compelling onboard AI apps to get consumers running out the door to buy AI PCs. Despite that, the industry is banking heavily on the concept to help push sales throughout 2024. Intel, AMD, and Nvidia (NVDA) are marketing some of their high-end laptops as AI PCs.\n\nOutside of their AI capabilities, Qualcomm claims the Arm-based X Elite and X Plus lines offer better performance per watt than the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS chips. The X Elite and X Plus also consume less power than competing Intel and AMD chips, Qualcomm says. Qualcomm on Wednesday announced its latest chips designed to run on Windows laptops, taking aim at Intel and Nvidia. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nQualcomm is even lining up the X Elite and X Plus against Apple’s Arm-based M3 chips, claiming that the processors are 28% and 10% faster than the iPhone maker’s offerings, respectively.\n\nIt’s important to note that these kinds of numbers are based on benchmarks, and real-world performance could differ.\n\nThis is just Qualcomm’s latest dive into the Windows PC market. The company already offers Arm-based chips for Windows systems but hasn't gained much traction in the market. Part of the reason for that had to do with translating apps built for x86 systems that run on Intel and AMD chips to work on Arm-based platforms.\n\nOver the years, however, more developers have reworked their apps to run on Arm-based chips making laptops running Qualcomm's hardware a more viable option for consumers and enterprise users.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nGoogle’s Chrome, for example, was a major holdout for Windows on Arm devices for years but now runs natively on Arm systems. That should help to set up Qualcomm’s chips as legitimate threats to Intel and AMD.\n\nWe’ll need to see how the Elite X and Plus X actually run on laptops in the real world to determine if they’re truly able to go toe-to-toe with Intel, AMD, and Apple’s M3 chips. But if Qualcomm’s benchmark numbers hold true, the PC market could be in for some major upheaval.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "The Overlooked AI Powerhouse: Why Oracle Stock Is Your Undervalued Tech Pick",
        "content": "Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a cloud-computing software specialist that has embedded artificial intelligence functionalities into its products. While Oracle usually isn’t top-of-mind on Wall Street, Oracle stock can be your top-secret portfolio pick for 2024.\n\nI’m actually surprised that Oracle isn’t usually mentioned in conversations about AI stocks. As we’ll discover, Oracle even has a partnership with an AI and cybersecurity superstar. It’s fine if the market currently under-appreciates Oracle, though, since it’s just an opportunity to pick up shares before they fly higher.\n\nOracle Teams Up With a Market Darling\n\nLet’s face it. It seems as if everybody and his uncle likes Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) nowadays. After all, in an unstable world, governments and private businesses will demand Palantir’s AI-enhanced data-analytics and cybersecurity products for a long time to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, it’s fair to say that Palantir is a darling of the market. Palantir isn’t an 800-pound gorilla like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is, but investors like Palantir’s growth prospects.\n\nSo, it makes sense that Oracle stock jumped after investors learned that the company is teaming up with Palantir Technologies. Specifically, Palantir’s enterprise-software products will be available through Oracle’s cloud-computing platform.\n\nThat announcement came in early April; by the 19th day of that month, the Oracle share price fell back and coughed up all the gains. It seems as if the market doesn’t fully appreciate the significance of the Oracle-Palantir team-up. It’s bound to bring a great deal of attention and exposure to Oracle’s cloud platform.\n\nIf some people don’t understand or don’t care about this landmark partnership, their loss can be your gain. That’s what contrarian and value investing is all about: seeing opportunities that other stock traders are overlooking.\n\nOracle’s Massive Investment in Japan\n\nSometimes, a company has to invest big money now in order to make bigger money later. Such is the case with Oracle, which recently disclosed its plans to invest more than $8 billion over the next decade in cloud-computing and AI technology in Japan.\n\nThis isn’t Oracle’s only recent AI-focused announcement, by the way. The company is also using AI to help banks combat money laundering, and is teaming up with AI research and product startup Reka to develop generative-AI models.\n\nThose are significant news items, but Oracle’s AI investment in Japan could be game changing. Sure, $8 billion is a hefty investment, but it will enable Oracle to “grow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s footprint across Japan.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUltimately, Oracle envisions “governments and businesses across Japan” moving their “mission-critical workloads to the Oracle Cloud” and deploying the company’s AI-enhanced solutions. This could be a highly lucrative long-term venture, as Japan is the fourth-largest economy in the world.\n\nOracle Stock: Put AI and Cloud Power in Your Portfolio\n\nNvidia stock and Palantir stock are obvious AI picks. However, sometimes the best opportunities aren’t the most obvious ones. That’s why savvy investors should conduct their due diligence on Oracle, which is often left out of the conversation.\n\nNotably, Oracle is immersed in the cloud-computing and AI fields. Furthermore, the company has a deal with Palantir Technologies and is preparing to expand its market footprint in Japan.\n\nWith all of that in mind, today is the right day to pick up some Oracle stock shares for a long-term buy-and-hold position.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The $20 AI Stock Outperforming Nvidia: Why Palantir Could Be the Next Big Thing in Tech",
        "content": "It’s still hard to believe that one of the best AI stocks still goes for around $20 a share. Where Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rocketed to the moon and now trades north of $850 a stub, Palantir stock (NYSE:PLTR) can be had for a double sawbuck.\n\nThat’s still equates to a $47 billion market cap, expressing the existence of some 2.1 billion shares outstanding, but it pales in comparison to Nvidia’s $2.1 trillion valuation. It’s clear the market sees better potential returns in one than the other yet would investors be right in expecting the gap to narrow? Let’s find out.\n\nGood but not good enough\n\nPalantir stock is performing admirably. Shares are up 24% in 2024 and 144% higher over the past year. We won’t make additional comparisons to Nvidia here because everyone knows the superlatives (and riches) that have been heaped upon its shares for the past two years. However, with Palantir having been labeled the “best pure-play” stock in AI, it is curious the stock doesn’t seem to reflect that designation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPart of the reason is the bulk of Palantir’s revenue comes from government contracts, some 55% of the total in 2023. Such dependence, though, is mercurial, as the whims of government budget priorities rule when contract wins flow. While the need for complex field assessments have taken on greater importance in recent years as global tensions and conflicts rise, having the government as your biggest client is not the path to the sort of meteoric growth trajectories AI investors expect.\n\nThe company recognizes the sluggishness that’s inherent in the business. “Some of this is due to the continuing resolution and timing of large potential contract awards. But it’s also a function of the (Defense) Department’s pace of scaling their AI and software efforts,” it said.\n\nHowever, Palantir stock has done a good job of increasingly tilting the balance of revenue away from the government and towards the private sector.  Commercial revenue jumped 32% last year, and for the AI shop’s U.S. enterprise customers, revenue surged 70%.\n\nSetting the stage for the next leg of growth\n\nCEO Alex Karp told investors, “Our U.S. commercial business continues to be a significant driver of our growth, a trend that we expect to continue.” He described the demand for AI from companies as “unrelenting.”\n\nIt is why Palantir stock has been focused on expanding the reach of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which businesses use to extract AI-powered decision-making goals for meaningful, real-world results. Palantir sold out availability for access to AIP in a single quarter, an achievement it thought take at least a year to reach. By the end of 2023, the company delivered over 560 “bootcamps” within 465 organizations.\n\nStory continues\n\nPointing to combining AIP with its existing Foundry platform for enterprise, chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor says there is exponential growth potential so that the “total addressable market expands considerably.”\n\nThe best still needs to do more\n\nPalantir invested heavily in AI and machine learning for many years, long before they were investing buzzwords. It also pours money into research and development. Last year R&D accounted for almost 20% of Palantir’s revenue, up 12% from the year-ago period. The commitment to continually investing in the technology is what gives PLTR stock a substantial competitive edge.\n\nThe AI stock’s perma-bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, who crowned PLTR stock not only the “best pure-play” in AI but also the “Messi of AI,” referring to the soccer great, recently raised his one-year price target to $35 per share. He sees the market for platforms like AIP to become a $1 trillion opportunity.\n\nNot everyone one Wall Street buys into that, though. Monness, Crespi, & Hardt analyst Brian White recently downgraded Palantir stock to a “strong sell” over what he sees as an “unprecedented generative AI hype cycle.”\n\nPalantir stock does carry a lofty valuation of 21 times sales. But if you want to see crazy multiples, look at Nvidia, which goes for 35 times sales. If we figure the “right” valuation is somewhere in between, expect Palantir Technologies to exhibit additional growth this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting markets right now due to the seemingly unlimited potential of its applications in businesses everywhere. Many large companies are making massive investments to integrate AI into their platforms and services to stay ahead of the charge and offer customers the latest and greatest edition tech has to offer.\n\nThe three stocks we will examine today are currently on a dip and trading at a lower price than their actual value. When stocks dip due to volatility or other short-term events, investors have an excellent opportunity to buy when the stock is cheaper and see significant profits when it bounces back to its former price.\n\nWe’ll detail why these three AI stocks are so prominent in today’s AI market and why the dips they are facing now give investors a chance to profit from their inevitable future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is unique to the other stocks on this list as the company is dedicated entirely to AI software for businesses. It offers AI software-as-a-service to assist other companies looking to integrate AI platforms into their operations.\n\nThe potential applications of C3.ai’s software are near the point where it is limited only by the imagination and vision of the company utilizing it. Because of the extensive range of uses possible within C3.ai’s AI development platform, the company has no peers that offer a similar service that makes up direct competition.\n\nDespite its state-of-the-art AI software and lack of competition, C3.ai has been on the dip since late February. The stock has fallen over 40% this year and sits at just over $21, almost half its peak earlier this year.\n\nC3.ai has taken a hit this year due to inflation affecting businesses’ spending power. However, despite these headwinds, the company is not showing a weak performance. The company’s most recent earnings report showed a year-over-year revenue increase of 18% and a 58% profit margin.\n\nWhile the company could improve its earnings and is priced low, there is no reason not to believe that C3.ai will be one of the first companies to benefit from businesses’ increasing demand for AI platforms.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most prominent cybersecurity companies to date and is also leading the charge in incorporating AI into its platform. Its generative AI analyst, Charlotte AI, offers advanced features as part of the company’s leading Falcon platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has seen a stellar performance since the summer of 2023 when the stock shot up 300% to reach its all-time high in February of this year. In fiscal 2024, the company generated over $3 billion in revenue and generated free cash flow of $938.2 million.\n\nSubscription revenue accounts for almost all of the company’s income and has some of the highest retention and adoption rates in the cybersecurity sector. While the company’s outlook expects another $1 billion increase in revenue over the next year, to much surprise, the stock has fallen over $40 in the past month.\n\nConsidering Crowdstrike has been one of the most expensive cybersecurity stocks, a dip like this presents an exceedingly rare opportunity for interested investors. While the stock may dip further with such a high valuation, there is a likelihood Crowdstrike will see another leap in the years to come. That makes the current dip a one-of-a-kind chance.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. It is a stock that has been on many investors’ lists over the past few years. The AI chip manufacturer is second only to tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but is in a fantastic position to capitalize on the growing demand for AI chips.\n\nThis past month, investors had a golden opportunity to buy AMD on the dip. The stock fell almost 20% due to volatility and macroeconomic headwinds. While AMD does not have as much market share as Nvidia, its products are up to par — some might say even better.\n\nAI chips allow users to extract the processing power necessary to run through the enormous amounts of data required for AI applications. While Nvidia’s H100 chips are exceedingly popular, AMD’s MI300 chips are even more powerful. AMD also offers open-source software that pairs with the chips, which claims to provide better accessibility to users than Nvidia’s software. AMD has profitable deals with monster companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for its chips, ensuring a steady income stream. With the coming boom in AI, AMD will certainly be at the forefront. Its current low price is something any investor should keep an eye on this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Selling",
        "content": "Within the last month, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh highs. While there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors and industries, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been widely credited with lifting these major stock indexes to record levels.\n\nPut simply, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded businesses in the country. These seven juggernauts are (listed in descending order by market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll seven of these companies have crushed the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade. This outperformance is a big reason why investors -- and members of Congress -- have flocked to these businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (and members of Congress) have historically flocked to the Magnificent Seven\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven are leaders or critical players in their respective industries:\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the undisputed leader in global desktop operating systems, while Azure is No. 2 in worldwide cloud infrastructure service spend. Apple's iPhone accounts for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share. Alphabet's Google was responsible for a 91% share of global internet search in March, while wholly owned streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) make up a 90% (or greater) share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is No. 1 globally in online retail market share. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services is the worldwide No. 1 in cloud infrastructure service spend. Meta Platforms owns the most sought-after social media real estate, with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and its other apps collectively attracting almost 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs), and is the only pure-play EV maker to have achieved recurring profits.\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive advantages, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales shows that select lawmakers on Capitol Hill have sent three Magnificent Seven stocks to the chopping block.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 Congress is selling: Nvidia\n\nAlthough Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband have made a small fortune purchasing call options in the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, when it comes to the purchasing and selling of common shares, members of Congress were decidedly sellers of Nvidia stock in 2023. Collectively, $1.76 million shares were sold by lawmakers last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest seller of all, according to data from Capitol Trades, has been House Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA). Between May 5, 2023 and Aug. 14, 2023, five sell orders were executed for Meuser, ranging from just $1,000 to $15,000, up to a sell order of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are three key reasons shares of Nvidia may be headed notably lower.\n\nTo start with, every next-big-thing investment trend since the advent of the internet 30 years ago has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and adoption of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nSecondly, Nvidia has the potential to cannibalize its own pricing power in the coming quarters. The scarcity of its in-demand GPUs drove the price of its A100 and H100 chips into the stratosphere last year. As Nvidia brings more production to market, and new competitors enter the space, GPU scarcity will decline. In turn, Nvidia's gross margin should retrace.\n\nThe third issue, which I believe is Nvidia's biggest hurdle, is that its top four customers (Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet) are all developing in-house GPUs of their own. These Magnificent Seven components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales, and we're probably witnessing a peak in orders from these industry titans. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 Congress is selling: Microsoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress have been steady sellers of is the largest publicly traded company, Microsoft. Though Microsoft is listed on Unusual Whales' heatmap as one of the most-purchased stocks in 2023 ($1.97 million shares bought by lawmakers), members of Congress collectively sold $11.61 million shares. That's a net of $9.64 million worth of Microsoft shares that were sold last year.\n\nWhereas Nvidia had one notable seller, a number of lawmakers couldn't stop selling shares of Microsoft:\n\nHouse Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) dumped between $1 million and $5 million in shares on Jan. 4, 2023. House Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) sold between $250,000 and $500,000 in shares on both March 1, 2023 and Aug. 30, 2023. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) shed $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Microsoft stock on June 20, 2023. House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) sold multiple rounds of Microsoft stock that commonly ranged between five-and-six figures throughout 2023.\n\nThe likeliest reason for this selling is simple profit-taking. Shares of the company gained 57% last year, with the company's investments in AI fueling its ascent.\n\nAnother reason lawmakers may have headed for the exit is Microsoft's valuation. Although Microsoft is an absolute cash cow, it ended April 19 at a multiple of nearly 32 times forward-year earnings. For some context, this is about a 10% premium to Microsoft's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, members of Congress might be concerned about a bubble brewing in the AI space. Microsoft has aggressively invested in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has been incorporating generative AI solutions into Azure. If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, some of Microsoft's valuation premium may be wiped away.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock No. 3 Congress is selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress can't stop selling is social media maven Meta Platforms. Though Meta doesn't appear on Unusual Whales' heatmap of congressional buying activity, it was one of the most-actively sold communication services providers in 2023, with aggregate selling of $2.6 million.\n\nThe culprit for the lion's share of this selling activity in Meta is Michael McCaul, Congress' second most-active stock trader (1,826 trades completed in 2023). In addition to dumping shares of Microsoft on numerous occasions, McCaul sold shares of Meta 16 times last year, based on data provided by Capitol Trades.\n\nAs with Nvidia and Microsoft, profit-taking is a logical reason why lawmakers headed for the exit in 2023. Meta was one of the top-performing megacap stocks last year, with its AI ties clearly providing a boost.\n\nAnother catalyst that may have encouraged members of Congress to pare down their stakes in Meta is the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession. Select predictive indicators and money-based metrics suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy may not be far off. Meta generated close to 98% of its revenue from advertising in 2023, and businesses aren't shy about reducing their ad spending when trouble arises. Although recessions are short-lived, they could hit Meta harder than other Magnificent Seven components.\n\nThe final factor that may be behind Congress' selling of Meta stock is the increasingly competitive social media landscape. The continued popularity of TikTok serves as formidable competition and could result in weaker ad-pricing power for Facebook, the top social media platform in the world.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe McCaul has made a big mistake parting with his shares of Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Longtime chip analyst Stacy Rasgon recently told Investor’s Business Daily  that the development of AI infrastructure would still be occurring five or ten years from now. Moreover, Rasgon stated that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still benefiting from strong demand for its products, and he thinks that those who believe that the company will experience any sort of downturn soon are mistaken. Rasgon’s comments are certainly positive for AI hardware stocks other than Nvidia which are benefiting a great deal from the AI boom. Here are three such AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to generate high profits for investors.\n\nAstera Labs (ALAB) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. semiconductor company Astera Labs Inc. (ALAB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) develops connectivity chips for cloud and artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nInvestment bank Barclays contended that Astera was poised to benefit from the ongoing proliferation of AI. The bank believes that the firm is ahead of the competition when it comes to providing data centers with the connectivity products that facilitate certain uses of AI which are likely to become much more prevalent over the long-term. Barclays started overage of ALAB with an $85 price target and an “overweight” rating.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe bank expects over 80% of ALAB’s revenue to be generated from products related to AI in 2024. As a result, I expect the firm to benefit tremendously from the continued, rapid proliferation of the technology. And in my view, that makes ALAB one of the best AI hardware stocks to buy now.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) provides many types of top-notch AI hardware and AI chips, including a new ethernet switch. AVGO also offers a chip whose neural network helps it avoid AI workloads from getting too dense and slowing down. Further, the company launched Jericho3-AI switch chips last year which are competitive with the more commonly used AI switch chips. Finally, Broadcom is selling custom AI chips to the large cloud infrastructure players.\n\nThe firm’s strategy appears to be working as its revenue jumped 34% versus the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, its earnings per share advanced 6% year-over-year to $10.99. Moreover, the firm says that it expects AI products to represent 35% of its sales this year. And it expects its financial results to be significantly boosted by higher demand for its AI products.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Broadcom has reported that it has recruited a second major customer for its AI ASIC chips. According to Japanese bank Mizuho, that customer is Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nDespite the market’s poor reaction to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s (NYSE:TSM) first-quarter results, they were actually quite good. The firm’s top-line jumped 13% versus the same period a year earlier to $18.87 billion. Plus, its net income increased 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. Moreover, the chip maker expects its top-line to rise by an impressive total of 20% to 25% this year.\n\nTSM reported that it was benefiting from strong sales of its high-performance computing chips which are used to create AI. According to CEO C.C. Wei, almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address their demands for energy efficient computing power.\n\nIn the wake of TSM stock’s recent pullback, its enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is a very low 0.56 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley analysts have a few ideas for investors looking to pick winning stocks this earnings season. In a recent note, a team of analysts led by the investment bank’s executive director of equity research, Michelle Weaver, highlighted 10 stocks with near-term catalysts from potentially strong earnings, new product releases, or other events that could spark a bull run in their shares.\n\nAlthough Wall Street’s consensus forecast for first-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share predicts average growth of just 2.7%, Weaver and her team expect a “sequential recovery” in earnings in the second quarter, followed by a second half “expansion.”\n\n“We believe earnings growth is set for a healthier runway through 2024,” they wrote, adding that, although earnings estimates haven’t moved much over the past six months, “investor confidence in the achievability of those estimates has increased.”\n\nEven after surging more than 200% in the past 12 months alone, Nvidia emerges as a potential big winner this earnings season, according to Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore. Moore has a buy-equivalent “overweight” rating on shares of Nvidia, and expects the stock to spike 21% to $1,000 over the next 12 months as it dominates its AI competition. “NVDA continues to see strong spending trends in AI, with upward revisions in demand from some of the newer customers such as Tesla and various sovereigns,” he wrote.\n\nMoore noted that there has been some “near-term anxiety” surrounding Nvidia’s transition from its older H100 generation chips to next-generation models. With a lot riding on sales of the new “Blackwell” AI chip, some investors feared that there could be a “pause” in Nvidia’s revenue growth, but Moore said that his “checks show no such pause, as underlying demand is strong.”\n\nDespite rising competition from Intel, Huawei, Samsung, and others, Moore expects Nvidia to maintain its market share. “Blackwell generation pricing looks to make a strong competitive statement—reducing enthusiasm for competitive offerings,” he wrote.\n\nThat should allow the tech giant to beat consensus earnings estimates and report strong guidance for investors in May. “Investors ought to maintain outsized exposures to the generative AI theme, as compute demand remains strong and there are increasing signals pointing to a durable multiyear investment cycle,” Moore concluded.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s team of analysts went on to highlight nine more stocks with buy-equivalent “overweight” ratings and near-term drivers that “should drive a meaningful move in each stock” in their note. Here are their earnings season movers.\n\nStory continues\n\n9 more stocks with positive earnings catalysts\n\nAbbVie\n\nPharmaceutical giant AbbVie has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year owing to concerns over rising competition for Humira, a drug used to treat arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. But Morgan Stanley noted that Humira represents less than 10% of AbbVie’s revenue and cited a few upcoming catalysts that could boost the company’s stock price. Analyst Terence Flynn highlighted the potential for AbbVie to report rising earnings per share figures on April 26, and for a new schizophrenia drug to show promising results in an upcoming clinical trial in the second half of 2024. “We believe that growth from ABBV’s ex-Humira business (primarily Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and aesthetics) is underappreciated and will drive the stock’s multiple,” he wrote.\n\nPrice Target: $196\n\n12-month Appreciation Potential: 15%\n\nAmazon\n\nMorgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak expects Amazon to beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates by a “significant” margin in the first quarter. The company has been focused on efficiency and cost-cutting in its fulfillment and e-commerce businesses—using robotics, reducing shipping distances, and implementing a number of other strategies that are starting to pay benefits, according to Nowak. “We see room for continued cost improvements as AMZN has multiple operational levers to drive North America and [International] cost to serve per unit lower,” he wrote.\n\nPrice Target: $215\n\n12-month Appreciation Potential: 20%\n\nCorning\n\nThe materials science company Corning, which produces specialty glass and other materials for scientific applications, is another potential winner, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall. The company has suffered over the past few years given weak demand for many of its products, particularly display glass. But, according to Marshall, industrywide LCD-panel-maker utilization rates, which give a picture of industrywide LCD-panel production, have outperformed the “bearish assumptions” of many. That means Corning has more potential screens for its glass sales than analysts previously anticipated.\n\n“We remain [overweight] Corning as we view it as a name well-positioned to participate in many mega-trends over the coming years, and where recessionary demand conditions are already well built into the price,” she wrote.\n\nPrice Target: $3512-month Appreciation Potential: 10%\n\nLazard\n\nThe financial-services giant Lazard should “deliver strong profitability” over the next few years, owing in large part to an M&A rebound, noted Morgan Stanley’s Ryan Kenny. Lazard made 59% of its revenues from advising on strategic M&A transactions between 2018 and 2022, according to Kenny. On top of that, the analyst said, there’s a key catalyst that could drive share prices higher in the near to medium term. “Lazard’s recent C-Corp conversion, completed in January 2024, should drive a multiple re-rating over time as newly eligible investors increase exposure to the stock,” he explained.\n\nPrice Target: $5812-month Appreciation Potential: 46%\n\nLifeStance Health Group\n\nLifeStance Health Group, which offers online psychiatry and therapy services, beat all of Wall Street’s earnings estimates in the fourth quarter, but the stock has fallen 10% since. Morgan Stanley’s Craig Hettenbach believes that’s a mistake, and investors are “overlooking solid fundamentals and improving execution.” The analyst predicts another strong showing in LifeStance’s first-quarter earnings report in mid-May, which, he says, will serve as a catalyst for share prices, along with rising population-wide demand for mental health services.\n\nPrice Target: $1012-month Appreciation Potential: 67%\n\nPaccar\n\nPaccar, which sells commercial trucks through well-known subsidiaries like Peterbilt and Kenworth, has soared more than 50% over the past 12 months amid stronger than forecast demand for commercial vehicles. Morgan Stanley’s Angel Castillo expects that run of performance to continue, even as truck sales decline slightly, owing to rising tractor orders. The analyst said he also believes the ongoing “commercial vehicle upcycle is only beginning.” He went on to highlight Paccar’s April 30 earnings, as well as the release of its preliminary truck order data on May 2, as potential positive catalysts for the stock.\n\nPrice Target: $14712-month Appreciation Potential: 30%\n\nS&P Global\n\nThe financial information, ratings, and analysis giant S&P Global will beat Wall Street’s estimates when it reports earnings on April 25, the result of “strong credit capital markets activity in the quarter and higher equity prices,” according to Morgan Stanley’s Toni Kaplan. The analyst pointed to the earnings report as a potential catalyst for further stock price appreciation, forecasting 55% year-over-year revenue growth in S&P Global’s transactional ratings business, compared with consensus estimates of just 34%.\n\n“We view SPGI as a leading information services provider with a unique position among peers to expand in high-growth areas,” Kaplan wrote, highlighting the potential for “greater synergies” from its recent merger with fellow data provider IHS Markit.\n\nPrice Target: $50012-month Appreciation Potential: 20%\n\nSBA Communications\n\nSBA Communications, a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates wireless communications infrastructure, is set to benefit from strong earnings on April 29 after providing “conservative” guidance to investors, according to Morgan Stanley’s Simon Flannery. The analysts said that SBA Communications is still benefiting from the 5G investment cycle, noting that only 50% of 5G tower sites have been upgraded with the more modern mid-band 5G tech.\n\nFlannery highlighted the extension of SBA Communications’ buyback program, potential M&A activity, and interest rate cuts, as well as the defensive nature of communications infrastructure stocks, as positive catalysts for its stock moving forward. “Fundamentals for SBA remain strong, backed by secular tailwinds from growth in U.S. mobile data at ~18% annually over the next six years,” he added.\n\nPrice Target: $24312-month Appreciation Potential: 22%\n\nSeagate Technology\n\nThe data storage company Seagate Technology should beat Wall Street’s earnings forecasts when it reports earnings April 23, according to Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring. The analyst noted that intra-quarter “checks” on Seagate showed rising hard drive disk production. “After a nearly two-year downcycle, it’s become clearer that the [hard drive disk] market is entering a gradual cyclical recovery, and moving into a period of AI-driven storage demand growth,” he wrote.\n\nPrice Target: $11512-month Appreciation Potential: 31%\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: April Edition",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) hype is fueling the market to new highs. As per a report from PwC, AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. And the greatest economic gains will be in China and North America. Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new highs driven by the soaring “Magnificent Seven”. If you are not investing in the multibagger AI stocks, you are missing out on big gains.\n\nThese companies continue to dominate the market and remain the best in the industry. However, other AI companies are overlooked right now and could become multi-baggers in the long term. If you missed the chance to own one of the Magnificent Seven, you can still buy AI stocks that are set to grow.\n\nLet’s take a look at three AI stocks that are multi-baggers in the making. These companies have made big moves in 2023 and could be on a roll this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn emerging leader in the big data space, PalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) sold its products to the government for many years. However, after it announced the AI platform (AIP), changes began for the company.\n\nTo promote the platform, the tech company offered boot camps which helped convert the leads into clients. Palantir Technologies managed to close 103 deals worth at least $1 million in the fourth quarter. Also, the management mentioned that there was a backlog of bootcamps. These may continue to drive revenue growth.\n\nThe success of its AI platform has helped PLTR stock soar 158% in the year and 26% year-to-date (YTD). Trading at $22 today, the stock has pulled back lately.\n\nThe company is integrating AI across its products and services. Also, the surge in commercial clients is further proof of the platform’s success. Palantir Technologies saw a 70% surge in U.S. commercial revenue in Q4, leading to a 19% stock surge.\n\nFor the first quarter, management is aiming for revenue in the range of $612 – $616 million, up from $608 million in Q4. Palantir Technologies is set to report results on May 6.\n\nGenerating significant revenue from government contracts, a Palantir Technologies investment can be a safe way to dip your toes into AI. Thus, it’s one stock that can double your money by 2025.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

After launching MI300X, the company recently unveiled new chips to beat the competition.\n\nCalling them the most powerful chips for business PCs, the company said that its Ryzen Pro 8040 processors and Ryzen Pro 8000 processors are built with the latest nanometer technology.\n\nAlso, AI-enabled PCs can help improve the market for desktops and laptops. Further, the company has strong financials and reported a revenue of $6.17 billion in Q4 with an EPS of 77 cents. For this year, it is aiming for AI chip sales of $3.5 billion.\n\nAlready, AMD has won the confidence of some of the biggest companies. Specifically, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have shown interest in using the MI300X accelerator microchips. Several companies lack time and resources to wait for Nvidia’s chips. So, they consider its biggest competitor, AMD.\n\nTrading at $152 today, AMD is up 69% in the year and 7% YTD. With increasing AI demand, the company could see higher revenue growth. TD Cowen analyst has a price target of $200 over the next 12 months with a buy rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn overlooked AI stock, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has a rich history as legacy software developer. The company is making the most of the AI revolution. Expanding capacity at the current data centers, it stands ready for tremendous growth over the next five years. The company will invest $8 billion through 2034 in Japan for AI infrastructure and cloud services.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle has global expansion plans, striking a partnership with Microsoft to build 100 new data centers. This will help meet the rising demand for Microsoft’s Azure. The union extends across multiple countries. Also, Oracle has entered into a partnership with Palantir to provide cloud infrastructure and AI solutions to companies.\n\nAnd, another interesting partnership with Nvidia allows both companies to join forces to run Nvidia’s applications on Oracle cloud infrastructure. These partnerships show Oracle’s potential and ability to offer solutions that meet changing industry demand.\n\nOracle reported impressive growth in Q3 results with a revenue of $13.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year (YOY), and an operating income of $3.8 billion. Its backlog was up 29% and stood at $80 billion, a record high.\n\nTherefore, I’m optimistic that the company will beat expectations in the upcoming results. Trading at $115, ORCL stock looks undervalued to me and could become a multi-bagger in the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) may have been the name of the game for the past year or so, but it’s not the only game in town. Wall Street has been watching other sectors for growth opportunities, particularly as valuations have gotten into the nose-bleed section.\n\nAs much of a rocketship as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was, it was not cheap by any stretch. Even with shares in official correction territory and down 20% from their all-time high, the AI stock still goes for 65 times earnings, 32 times sales and 72 times the free cash flow it produces. That’s hardly a bargain-basement valuation.\n\nBecause there are more fish to fry with potential big gains to be made, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analysts cast a wide net when looking for stocks to recommend. While investors always need to be careful when looking at analyst recommendations because their firms may have a financial interest in boosting a stock, here are three stocks the white shoe firm says can grow 53% or more over the next year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry hasn’t even taxied onto the runway yet. Still, JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith says Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) will be one of the companies that will help it take flight. The Wall Street Pro has a buy rating on the stock and set an $8 per share one-year price target. That implies a 118% upside over the next year and is worth looking at more closely.\n\nLike fellow eVTOL stock Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY), Archer is wending its way through the regulatory labyrinth the Federal Aviation Administration devised before it can get airborne. Archer says it is on track to launch its commercial robotaxi service after gaining flight certification next year.\n\nThe eVTOL has important industry backing from automakers, airlines, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. Archer says it has an order book for 700 aircraft once it receives FAA approval, the United Arab Emirates will let it launch its service once the FAA gives it the green light and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) is financing the construction of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.\n\nCreating something out of nothing could be risky, but Archer Aviation stock could pay off handsomely for early investors.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) A Baidu (BIDU) sign outside a company office in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidering the rising trade and geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China, picking Chinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) as a winning investment may seem counterintuitive for JPMorgan. Yet analyst Alex Yao has a buy rating and a $185 per share price target on the stock, suggesting a 91% upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpecting a stock to double is not a rarity. Wall Street, though, tends to be a bit more timid in its outlook. Analysts often prefer singles and doubles rather than swinging for the fences, so let’s see why Baidu earns such big marks.\n\nAI is likely the reason behind this pick. Just as nascent technology is influencing everything stateside, so is it having an impact overseas. Baidu promises to infuse its services with AI at every turn and is already doing so by leaps and bounds. Co-founder and CEO Robin Li previously said AI will “set the stage for sustained multi-year revenue and profit expansion within” Baidu’s Ernie ecosystem. Ernie is the company’s version of ChatGPT. Ernie Bot has already attracted 200 million daily users.\n\nWith the stock trading at 8 times next year’s earnings and less than the cash it has in the bank, Baidu does seem cheaply valued.\n\nRIOT Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalyst Smith is also hyped about the potential RIOT Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) can bring to the market. He recently tweaked his price target on the cryptocurrency miner, raising it by $1 to $16 per share. He also reiterated his outperform rating on the stock. That gives RIOT a 49% upside if his thesis plays out correctly.\n\nConsidering last week’s Bitcoin (USD-BTC) halving event, you would not expect him to be so confident. Miners will see their Bitcoin rewards cut in half. Instead of receiving the current 6.25 bitcoins per block, RIOT will only receive 3.125 bitcoins. Yet Smith was adamant.\n\n“$RIOT enjoyed lowest power costs per coin mined in 2023,” he told investors in a research note. “Post-halving, we expect it to be [among] two lowest cost producers given its scale and attractive power contracts.”\n\nRIOT Platforms stock soared, rising 13% on the news. That’s not nearly enough to wipe out the trading deficit it has racked up. Shares are down 50% from their 52-week high. But if the JPMorgan analyst is right, the halving event could see RIOT stock achieving break-even status.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This evolution suggests a dynamic future where robotics stocks to buy now transform industries and create new opportunities in manufacturing, logistics and personalized services, contributing positively to economic growth and innovation in the U.S.\n\nThe robotics industry is expected to reach $95.93 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 15.91%. Robotics has become more prominent in the market due to increased demand combined with large investments in the industry. This makes it clear that investing in the industry will be profitable with the innovation-based economy and robotic industry growth, but investing in these three specific top robotics stocks will benefit your portfolio even more.\n\nPTC (PTC) The PTC (PTC) website is displayed on an open laptop.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPTC (NASDAQ:PTC) provides an augmented reality and industrial IoT platform and CAD software. The company’s products help manufacturers digitize product development processes, improving efficiency and driving innovation. Over the past year, its stock has climbed nearly 40%, but analysts are still bullish. 21 analysts have a median price target of $202, representing a 14% increase from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPTC is well-positioned to benefit from this secular digitization trend, and its latest earnings report underscores this point. In Q1 2024, the company grew ARR by 24% YOY, revenue by 18% YOY, and free cash flow by 6% YOY. Despite the challenging macro backdrop, PTC maintained both top and bottom-line growth. For FY2024, the company forecasts ARR to increase by 14% YOY, revenue by 13% YOY, free cash flow by 23% YOY, and EPS by 61% YOY. Supported by solid growth, PTC boasts resilient and robust financial figures.\r\n\r\nMoreover, PTC has a history of making strategic acquisitions. Most recently, it acquired pure-systems, a leading provider of product variant management solutions. The acquisition is expected to add important functionality to PTC’s existing portfolio of products and allow it to support its customers better.\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) provides enterprise asset intelligence solutions worldwide, including barcode scanners, interactive kiosks, mobile devices, and software. The company’s products help businesses digitize and automate their workflows, improving productivity and operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, weakening demand has negatively impacted Zebra’s sales, and the company’s financial figures have been struggling in recent quarters. In Q4 2023, net sales fell by 32.9% YOY, and net income decreased by 90.9% YOY, underscoring Zebra’s challenges. However, this weakness can be attributed to market and macroeconomic conditions, not to any issues within the company itself. Zebra’s global presence, scale and diversified business give it a distinct competitive advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Zebra is at the forefront of the AI revolution, introducing its exciting innovations. The company’s AI initiatives can potentially drive demand for its products. For example, Zebra collaborates with industry giants like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud and Android, as well as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to incorporate new generative AI capabilities into its handheld devices. This cutting-edge technology will empower front-line employees to access domain-specific knowledge, enhancing their decision-making abilities and overall productivity.\n\nTo summarize, there is hope for a recovery in Zebra’s business. Until then, you can buy this option in robotics stocks at a reasonable 25 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nHitachi (HTHIY) the hitachi logo on a building\n\nSource: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com\n\nHitachi (OTCMKTS:HTHIY) is a Japanese multinational conglomerate that produces industrial equipment and technologies for robots. Currently trading at $179.94, HTHIY is up 24.79% YTD and is rated a “strong buy” by Wall Street analysts.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Hitachi beat analyst expectations and reported outstanding top- and bottom-line growth. Total revenues increased 16% year over year to 2,258 billion yen, while net income jumped an astonishing 116.2% year over year to 235.9 billion yen. The company’s growth is expected to continue, with management forecasting a staggering 114% increase in EPS for FY 2023. This remarkable performance underscores the company’s ability to enhance cash flows and scale its revenues, making it an attractive investment.\n\nThe most significant catalyst behind Hitachi’s success is its recent partnership with AI giant Nvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) to incorporate generative AI into its business. Hitachi will utilize Nvidia Omniverse to stimulate and develop large-scale solutions through this collaboration. The company will also combine its Lumada AI library with Nvidia’s AI Enterprise and Modulus platforms to enhance customer experience, improve its offerings, and create intelligent, AI-centric solutions. Overall, Hitachi’s partnership with Nvidia will be a boon to its business by boosting efficiency in its products and services.\n\nHitachi is an attractive choice among robotics stocks, boasting stellar financials and a strategic partnership with Nvidia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market rally on April 22. Cramer said that when you have many down days you can almost always expect a bounce back. Cramer was surprised that the market \"shrugged off\" Verizon's weak earnings which according to him was \"disappointing\" in every category, including cash flows. Cramer highlighted Tesla's continuous declines despite the company's latest announcement of price cuts and layoffs. Tesla's competitors Ford and GM, on the other hand, gained, with the former gaining 6%.\n\nPeople Do Not Want Tesla Cars, Cramer Says\n\nJim Cramer commented on Tesla's declines and said that people \"still want cars\" but they don’t want Teslas or \"even EVs in general.\" Cramer revealed that his Charitable Trust owns a stake in Ford, which according to him, has the \"best non-electric lineup including hybrids.\" Cramer highlighted that Ford is one of the cheapest stocks in the S&P 500 and the latest jump in the stock shows the market is willing to buy cheap stocks.\n\nAnother reason behind the latest market rally was financials stocks. Cramer said Bank of America and JPMorgan were impressive, but \"nothing comes close\" to American Express.\n\nCramer Calls Nvidia a \"Hideous Stock\" Because of Recent Losses\n\nCramer also talked about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), his favorite AI stock which has fallen off the cliff recently. Cramer urged his viewers to \"listen\" and \"don’t laugh\" has he analyzed the latest Nvidia moves. Cramer admitted NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a \"hideous\" stock lately.\n\n\"Nvidia has gone from being the start of the show to being the goat of the game, and I'm not talking about the greatest of all time.\"\n\nCramer said Nvidia's stock may have finally become \"cheap enough to start tempting people.\" However, Cramer said many high-multiple stocks roared back in the latest rally. He said if NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) hadn’t bounced back in the recent rally, it would have been a \"horrible sign\"\n\nHowever, Cramer reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s business remains strong. Nvidia is down about 13% over the past one month.\n\nCramer also mentioned Meta and Alphabet's gains, saying TikTok's ban could give a boost to Meta's numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer Says \"Punishment\" is Coming\n\nCramer said that he's expecting a W-shaped market movement in the next few days. He warned investors that the \"punishment\" will come, even though the current rally could last for about 10 days. 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. Cramer recommends investors to sell some of these stocks, and urges a wait-and-see approach for others. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nJim Cramer recently talked about Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) and how Ken Griffin's Citadel targeted Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) in a statement, calling Trump's media business a \"loser.\" Cramer said Griffin can't seem to stay out of controversies, referring to his shorting of GameStop shares which triggered a battle between retail investors and short-selling hedge fund firms.\n\nCramer subtly agreed with Citadel's statement which called Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) \"basically a joke.\"\n\n\"I don’t know.. it is kind of a joke\"\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on DJT, he recommends buying Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the long term.\n\n9. Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nSmall modular reactors company Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is advising investors to stay away from. Answering a question about whether Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) should be bought on the back of increasing power demand following AI datacenter boom, Cramer said he believes \"no power company can make money off of it\" so you should \"better buy\" Vertiv or Eaton.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 14 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR).\n\n8. Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nHere is what Jim Cramer said when he was asked about Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN), the Massachusetts-based  aerogel insulation products company.\n\n\"This thing is up so big, and what a great opportunity to sell the stock of a money-losing company after you've made a lot of money.\"\n\nCramer urged investors to \"take the profit\" from their investments in Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN), whose shares are up a whopping 165% over the past one year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 17 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN). The biggest stakeholder of Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN) during this period was Andrew N. Wiener's Samjo Capital with a $36 million stake. Hedge funds are also buying Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n7. MarineMax Inc (NYSE:HZO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nJim Cramer thinks investing in recreational boat and yacht retailer company MarineMax Inc (NYSE:HZO) is \"too risky\" as of now.\n\n\"I know the multiple is really low, but I just don’t like that sector of the market at this moment.\"\n\nUnlike Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which Cramer recommends for the long term, the CNBC host is bearish on HZO.\n\nDuring an earnings call in January, MarineMax talked about guidance:\n\n\"Based on our industry unit expectation and our results to date, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in 2024. We are seeing increased discounting in the industry and the industry product margins are moderating to prepandemic levels. While our profitability was below our expectations this quarter, we continued to reach the long-term benefits of our higher-margin strategy and are confident in our ability to maintain consolidated margins in the low to mid-30s. Thinking ahead, it’s worth noting that in the March 2023 quarter, we had lower interest costs driven by lower rates and lower inventory than we will have this quarter. Factoring all this in, we now expect our adjusted net income per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.70 for fiscal 2024 with adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $215 million.\n\nWe are using an annual expected tax rate of approximately 27% and a share count of 23.1 million in our assumptions. Looking at current trends, with the seasonally smallest quarter of the year behind us, we are cautiously encouraged by the reasonably strong start to the winter boat show season.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nAce River Capital made the following comment about MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO) operates a vertically integrated boat and yacht company with manufacturing, retail sales, financing, insurance, all the way down to maintenance and storage operations. The company has a strong portfolio of marinas and is in a great position to be able to roll up additional retailers, marinas, and storage facilities. I do wish the company would provide more information on its capital allocation strategy and how it thinks about the decisions to target retailers, real estate/marinas, or share repurchases. This would provide foresight for investors and keep management accountable for decisions. RCI Hospitality has a capital allocation strategy slide mentioned earlier in this letter, that is the type of thing I would love to see from MarineMax . I will attempt to bring this up to management. Until I can gather more information about the capital allocation strategy this will remain my lowest conviction holding but trading at just 3x cash with a strong position in the high margin/high cost segments of the boating industry I like the entry point.”\n\n6. IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nQuantum computing company IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks you should stay away from according to Jim Cramer. A caller asked Jim Cramer during the Lightning Round segment of his program about IO NQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ). Cramer said it's a tough time for tech stocks as they are in a \"free fall\" including the companies that are doing \"incredibly well.\" In this environment, Cramer said money-losing  stocks like IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ) are a \"sell, sell, sell.\"\n\nOf the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database, 21 hedge funds reported owning stakes in IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ).\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "The primary focus of Investor’s Business Daily’sIBD Big Cap 20 list is large-capitalization stocks. The reasoning behind these picks is that they are steady, conservative equities that investors can expect consistency from. Some of the firms on this list even provide dividends. The Big Cap 20 includes names that can rally a great deal despite their large size. Indeed, many of the names over the years, such as ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) have all rallied tremendously during their tenures on the IBD’s Big Cap 20. Here are three stocks from the IBD’s Big Cap 20 that look poised to deliver outsized gains for investors in the medium term and the long term.\n\nMartin Marietta (MLM) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMartin Marietta (NYSE:MLM) provides raw construction materials. The company is benefiting from Washington’s huge infrastructure spending and from U.S. factories being built.\n\nIndeed, British bank HSBC wrote that the firm would benefit from its pricing power as a result of Washington’s infrastructure initiatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment bank Jeffries recently identified Martin Marietta as one of 12 high-quality mid-cap names to buy. The bank believes that mid-cap names have been beaten down and are poised to rally.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, MLM’s top line climbed 9% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.6 billion, while its earnings per share from continuing operations soared 54% year-over-year to $4.63.\n\nMLM has an attractive enterprise/EBITDA ratio of 18 times.\n\nThe combination of MLM’s strong growth catalysts and low valuation makes it one of the more attractive members of IBD’s Big Cap 20.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it. Stocks to Buy in March\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) specializes in mining gold. As gold prices have climbed, AEM stock has gone along for the ride, rising 29% over in the last three months.\n\nThere are many reasons for the large gains in gold prices. Among these catalysts are relatively high inflation along with America’s huge, rapidly rising debt. The continuous, sizeable purchases of the metal by many of the world’s central banks have also caused an increase in gold pricing. None of these catalysts looks likely to weaken significantly anytime soon, so gold prices are likely to continue to climb for the foreseeable future, further lifting AEM in the process.\n\nAlso important is a little-noticed development: the very popular retail chain Costco (NYSE:COST) is now selling $100 million to $200 million in gold and silver monthly, Wells Fargo estimated recently. Costco’s decision to sell the metals is enabling America’s middle class to invest in them more easily than ever before. I believe that this initiative has set up a virtuous cycle in which the middle class is buying the metals, causing their prices to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAEM has an attractive trailing price-earnings ratio of 16 times and a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT) provides monitoring systems and power management products for data centers.\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of AI causing the demand for data centers to jump, VRT’s top and bottom lines have soared in recent quarters. Since the utilization of AI will continue to increase very rapidly for many years, VRT’s long-term outlook is strong.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street appears to be falling in love with the name, as many investment banks have recently issued positive notes on the stock.\n\nFor example, Bank of America recently added VRT to its list of “best investment ideas,” while Oppenheimer started coverage of the name with an “outperform” rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI and NOW. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\nNVDA boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy Right After the April Bitcoin Halving",
        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event has passed, and with it comes a renewed interest in blockchain technology and its potential for transforming various industries. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, savvy investors are looking beyond just Bitcoin and exploring opportunities in companies that are leveraging blockchain technology to disrupt traditional business models.\n\nDespite the fears around “higher for longer” interest rates, geopolitical instabilities and a stock market sell-off, I am firmly bullish on Bitcoin’s short-term future. The coin has already made a run up to $66,000 at the time of writing over the past few days, and as ETF trading goes into full swing this week, I believe that those numbers could approach the $70,000 mark.\n\nIt should be noted that Bitcoin was overvalued based on several momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) before the sell-off occurred this month. In order for it to maintain such a high price velocity, an extremely bullish backdrop would have been needed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut now that Bitcoin has come back to Earth again, I think it’s in the prime spot for rocketing higher, and blockchain stocks can be a great way to do so.\n\nSo here are seven blockchain stocks for investors to consider.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has established itself as a leader in the Bitcoin mining industry by significantly increasing its mining power while simultaneously reducing its cost of mining Bitcoin to nearly zero. This remarkable achievement is largely due to the company’s strategic power use and the power credits it arranges with energy companies. By paying around $6,141 per Bitcoin, Riot Platforms can pocket the premium, giving it a substantial edge over its competitors.\n\nThe company’s power management strategy sets it apart in an industry often criticized for its heavy electricity use and high operating costs. This competitive advantage positions RIOT for continued success moving forward.\n\nI see RIOT as being a synthetic (and leveraged) bet on Bitcoin for obvious and not-immediately not obvious reasons. I think that Bitcoin miners like RIOT will one day transition their business models to something more sustainable energy wise.\n\nBut with the stock being up 10.13% already on Monday before the market opens at the time of writing, this implies there could be significant volatility on the cards to send RIOT to the moon later this week.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is recognized not only for its high-performance GPUs but also for its significant role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. The company’s GPUs are widely used in cryptocurrency mining, which is crucial for the mining of various digital currencies. This has helped establish Nvidia as a strong player in the blockchain market.\n\nDespite its primary fame in AI and gaming technologies, Nvidia’s impact extends significantly into the crypto world, influencing the dynamics of AI crypto tokens. For example, tokens like Fetch.ai (FET-USD) are often affected by Nvidia’s performance, given the company’s substantial sway over the tech and crypto industries.\n\nFor this reason I think that NVDA could rally over the next week especially as the halving events gets fully priced in.\n\nFinancially, Nvidia also presents an interesting opportunity. While its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high, indicating a rich valuation, its forward P/E ratio suggests that the market is optimistic about its future earnings potential.\n\nGreenidge Generation (GREE) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy. breakthrough stocks. Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreenidge Generation (NASDAQ:GREE) operates as a vertically integrated cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation company. It’s notably engaged in cryptocurrency mining with a focus on using greener technologies, which positions it distinctively in the sector.\n\nDespite experiencing a significant drop in its stock value over the past year, the company is making strides in enhancing its infrastructure, having recently expanded its power capacity with additional low-cost power in key territories such as South Carolina and Mississippi​.\n\nAs a penny stock, GREE’s daily charts look somewhat like a heart rate monitor, and I believe that its volatility will only increase.\n\nGREE is attempting to solve what some consider one of Bitcoin’s most pressing issues: energy use, or rather energy waste. Of course, one can always make the argument that any form of energy spent on Bitcoin is wasteful, but then it wouldn’t matter what energy source you could use in that case.\n\nGREE is making a practical step forward while other miners have their heads in the sands that the energy use is a problem, which makes it one of those stocks to buy to take advantage of the halving event.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is perhaps the most obvious play for investors looking to take advantage of the Bitcoin halving event. Additionally, the potential ongoing implementation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. could reshape the market by broadening access to cryptocurrencies and adding layers of financial products, which COIN is a key custodian of.\n\nI expect that COIN will see some record quarters over the next year via a huge number of trading fees, especially in the current quarter.\n\nSome of this can be explained via the (speculatively artificial) expansion of the mempool recently. This has led to record transaction fees being charged over a short time period, with some as high as $10,000 on the extreme end of the scale.\n\nThe reason being is that some projects have stopped building on alternative blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) and opt for building on Bitcoin instead for its perceived credibility. Teams are minting ETFs, and a cynic would suggest that these prices are being driven artificially higher.\n\nAlthough this thesis is speculative and somewhat cynical, it’s undeniable that transaction fees have gone up considerably, and this on top of all the trading fees that COIN will be announcing as well, making it one of those hot stocks to watch.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, heavily influencing its stock value due to its investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\nMy thesis for MSTR is that its book value per share will be inflated throughout the year as Bitcoin continues its rally. This in turn may lead institutions and retail investors to surmise that it’s undervalued, which would drive its stock price higher.\n\nMSTR  currently holds around 214,246 bitcoins on the balance sheet, which is the equivalent to over 1% of all the total bitcoin that has ever been mined, a huge sum, Bloomberg reported.\n\nFurthermore, in its recent activities, MSTR completed substantial financial maneuvers, including the issuance of $603.75 million in convertible notes, aiming to further increase its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nMSTR has made a pullback on the yearly chart and it trades considerably below its all-time high. I think that if Bitcoin is able to breach its key resistance areas then we’ll see MSTR also rocket in response.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration, the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining industry with extensive operations.\n\nMARA has outlined ambitious plans for expansion and growth. The company aims to increase its Bitcoin mining capacity. Additionally, MARA intends to continue investing in the latest mining hardware and technology.\n\nThe CEO of Marathon, Fred Thiel, suggested that the halving event was already priced into the market. Thiel believed that significant demand from ETFs has already absorbed some of this impact. As a result, the halving may have a limited effect on Bitcoin prices.\n\nThis may seem to contradict MARA was one of the post-having stocks to buy, but the recent price movements by Bitcoin seem to suggest otherwise. Bitcoin briefly breached the $60,000 support level and has since rebounded strongly after the halving event. ETF inflows are also strong.\n\nThe issue with saying that the market is “pricing things in” is that it’s a reasonable assumption but ultimately an unfalsifiable thing to claim. For the record: MARA is up 3% in pre-market trading today.\n\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR) stock button on a computer keyboard (representing best investments to start 2021. stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBitdeer Technologies (NASDAQ:BTDR) offers competitive share prices and has a low breakeven point for Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitdeer reported robust revenues in the fourth quarter of the previous year, with a significant increase in self-mining revenues. The company also achieved positive earnings per share (EPS) compared to the previous year.\n\nBitdeer has also made strategic moves to enhance its profitability and expand its operations. These include appointing founder Jihan Wu as CEO, opening a data center in Bhutan to reduce electricity costs, and leveraging immersion cooling technology in its Norway data center to optimize electricity usage.\n\nThe main reason I like BTDR though comes from its low valuation, especially compared to other Bitcoin miners. It trades a just 1.89 times sales, and has a positive forward P/E ratio.\n\nAs a relatively undervalued gem in the market, I think that BTDR has has the potential to surge much higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 \"Magnificent 7\" Stocks Ready to Report Earnings. Here's What to Expect\n\nAmid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\n\nNVIDIA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of NVIDIA fell 13.6% last week and are down about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.\n\nApple and Microsoft lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms and Alphabet erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\n\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. First-quarter earnings for Magnificent Seven are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\n\nProfits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nHere, we discuss three companies from the Magnificent Seven — Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — that are set to release earnings this week. Meta Platforms will report on Apr 24, while Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%). Shares of META have surged about 22% over the past three months.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -3.36% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 14.69% and modest revenue growth of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company's earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 7.22%. Earnings are expected to increase 27.4%, while revenues are expected to grow 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 18%) and has climbed 5.5% in the past three months.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence had a strong start to the year, delivering solid results for the first quarter of 2024. We came in at the upper end of our guidance range on all key financial metrics and are raising our financial outlook for the year. \r\nWe exited Q1 with a better-than-expected record backlog of $6 billion, which sets us up nicely for the year and beyond. John will provide more details in a moment. \r\nLong-term trends of hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and 5G, all turbocharged by AI super cycle are fueling strong broad-based design activity. We continue to execute our long-standing intelligent system design strategy as we systematically build out our portfolio to deliver differentiated end-to-end solutions to our growing customer base. \r\nTechnology leadership is foundational to Cadence. And we are excited by the momentum of our product advancement over the last few years and the promise of our newly unveiled products. Generative AI is reshaping the entire chip and system development process. And our Cadence.AI portfolio provides customers with the most comprehensive and impactful solutions for chip-to-systems intelligent design acceleration. \r\nBuilt upon AI-enhanced core design engine, our GenAI solution boosted by foundational LLM copilot are delivering unparalleled productivity, quality of results and time-to-market benefits for our customers.

In Q1, a leading automaker expanded its production deployment of Millennium to multiple groups. After a successful early access program, in which it realized tremendous performance benefits. \r\nAllegro X continued its momentum and is now deployed at well over 300 customers, while Allegro X AI, the industry's first fully automated PCB design engine is enabling customers to realize significant 4 to 10x productivity gain. Samsung used Celsius Studios to uncover early design and analysis insight to precise and rapid thermal simulation for 2.5D and 3D packages attaining up to a 30% improvement in product development time. And a leading Asian mobile chip company use Optimality Intelligence System Explorer AI technology and Clarity 3D Solver obtaining more than 20x design productivity improvement. \r\nEver increasing complexities in the system verification and software bring up continue to propel the demand of our functional verification products. With hardware-accelerated verification now a must-have part of the customer design flow. On the heels of a record year, our hardware products continue to proliferate at existing customers while also gaining some notable competitive wins, including at a leading networking company and at a major automotive semiconductor supplier. \r\nDemand for hardware was broad-based with the particular strength seen at hyperscalers and over 85% of the orders during the quarter included both platforms. Our Verisium platform that leverages big data and AI to optimize verification workloads, boost coverage and accelerate root cause analysis of bugs saw accelerating customer adoption. At CadenceLIVE Silicon Valley, Qualcomm said that they use Verisium stim AI to increase total design coverage automatically while getting up to a 20x reduction in verification workload run time. \r\nOur digital IC business had another solid quarter as our digital full flow continued to proliferate at the most advanced nodes. We had strong growth at hyperscalers, and over 50 customers have deployed our digital solutions on 3-nanometer and below design. Cadence Cerebrus, which leverages GenAI to intelligently optimize the digital full flow in a fully automatic manner now has been used in well over 350 tapeouts. Delivering best-in-class PPA and productivity benefits. It's fast becoming integral part of the design flow at marquee customers, as well as in [deep TCO] flows for new process nodes at multiple foundries. \r\nIn custom IC business, Virtuoso Studio, delivering AI-powered layout automation and optimization continued (inaudible) strongly, and 18 of the top 20 semi have migrated to this new release in its first year. Our IP business continued to benefit from market opportunities offered by AI and multi chiplet-based architecture. We are seeing strong momentum in interface IPs that are essential to AI use cases, especially HBM, DDR, UCIe and PCIe at leading edge nodes. \r\nIn Q1, we partnered with Intel foundry to provide design software and leading IP solutions at multiple Intel advanced nodes. Our Tensilica business reached a major milestone of 200 software partners in the HiFi ecosystem, the de facto standard for automotive infotainment and home entertainment. And we extended our partnership with one of the top hyperscalers in its custom silicon SoC design with our Xtensa NX controller. \r\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and the continuing momentum of our business. (inaudible) chip and system design complexity and the tremendous potential of AI-driven automation offer massive opportunities for our computational software to help customers realize these benefits. \r\nIn addition to our strong business results, I am proud of our high-performance inclusive culture and thrilled that Cadence was named by Fortune and Great Place to Work as one of the 2024's 100 Best Companies to Work For, ranking #9. \r\nNow I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q1 results and our updated 2024 outlook.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter bookings were a record for Q1, and we achieved record Q1 backlog of approximately $6 billion. A good start to the year, coupled with some impressive new product launches, sets us up for strong growth momentum in the second half of 2024.\r\nHere are some of the financial highlights from the first quarter, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1.09 billion. GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.91 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.17. \r\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash balance at quarter end was $1.012 billion, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow was $253 million. DSOs were 36 days, and we used $125 million to repurchase Cadence shares in Q1. \r\nBefore I provide our updated outlook, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded in our outlook.\r\nGiven the recent launch of our new hardware systems, we expect the shape of hardware revenue in 2024 to weigh more towards the second half as our team works to build inventory of the new system. Our updated outlook does not include the impact of our pending BETA CAE acquisition, and it contains the usual assumption that export control regulations that exist today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year. \r\nOur updated outlook for fiscal 2024 is revenue in the range of $4.56 billion to $4.62 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. GAAP EPS in the range of $4.04 to $4.14. Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.88 to $5.98. \r\nOperating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion. And we expect to use at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares. With that in mind, for Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.77, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.20 to $1.24. \r\nAnd as usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. \r\nIn summary, Cadence continues to lead with innovation and is on track for a strong 2024 as we execute to our intelligent system design strategy. \r\nI'd like to close by thanking our customers, partners and our employees for their continued support. \r\nAnd with that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\n\nJoseph D. Vruwink\n\nMaybe just to start with your outlook for the year. Can you perhaps provide maybe your second half assumption before this quarter versus where it stands today in terms of just recalibrating around delivery schedules. And maybe a good way to frame it, I think in the past, you gave a share of this year's revenue that was going to come from upfront products. Is that still the right range, but if it is the right range, you can obviously see more is going to end up landing in the second half. And so that kind of puts to your original views? Or how is that, I guess, skewed relative to what might have been the expectation a quarter ago?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nIt's a great question, Joe. And I think you've hit on the main point there. But upfront revenue driving a lot of the quarter-over-quarter trends this year. But when I look at last year, you recall that we had a large backlog of hardware orders, and we dedicated 100% of the hardware production in Q1 to deliver that hardware in Q1 2023. As a result, in Q1 2023, 20% of our Q1 '23 revenue was from upfront revenue sources. But in contrast, Q1 this year, it's only 10% of the total revenue for this Q1 is coming from upfront revenue. \r\nBut again last year and to reflect on where we thought we were this time last quarter, but we still expect that upfront revenue will probably be 15% to 20%, I mean, in and around the midpoint there is 17.5% and expectation for upfront revenue this year and a midpoint of, say, 82.5% for recurring revenue. That's still the same as what we thought this time last quarter. But that contrast with last year was, I think, 16% of our revenue was up front last year. \r\nAnd to put dollar terms on it, last year, $650 million of our revenue was upfront. This year, we're expecting roughly $800 million to be upfront. The first half versus first half last year, we had 350 in the first half and 300 in the second half because we had prioritized all those shipments in hardware and that skewed the numbers towards the first half last year, so 350 and 300, ending with the 650 of upfront revenue last year. This year, it looks more like 250 and 550 at the back end. \r\nBut I know that's largely as a result of -- we had a record backlog, our record bookings quarter in Q1. We've got substantial backlog in IP that we're scaling up to deliver. A lot of that revenue falls into the second half. And also, we launched these new hardware systems last week hardware revenue is expected to be more second half weighted now because based on what we've heard, and I'll let Anirudh chime in here on the technical aspects of the new hardware systems, but we expect them to be so popular, but a lot of demand will shift to those new hardware systems, and we'll have to ramp up production to be able to deliver that demand. So it shifts some of the upfront revenue to the second half. \r\nSo I think upfront revenue is really driving a lot of the skewed metrics. Anirudh, do you want to talk about Z3?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, absolutely. So we are very proud of the new systems we launched. As you know, we are a leader in hardware-based emulations with Z2 X2. And last time we launched them was in 2021. So that was like a 6-year cycle, Z1 X1 was 2015, and then Z2 X2 was '21. So what I'm particularly pleased about is we have a major, major refresh. It's a game-changing product, but it was also developed in only 3 years. So in 2024, we have a new refresh. And it's a significant leap in terms of capacity. And even last week at our CadenceLIVE conference, NVIDIA and Jensen talked about how they use Z2 to design their latest chip like Blackwell, and it's also used by all the major silicon companies and system companies to design their chips.\r\nBut what is truly exciting about Z3 and X3 is this a big leap. It's like Z3 is 4x, 5x more capacity than Z2, it's a much higher performance. So it sets us up nicely for the next several years to be able to design the several generations of the world's largest chips, okay? So that's the right thing to do. The reason we can do it in 3 years versus 6 years is we use our own design internally in Cadence for TSMC advanced node. So we're using all our latest tools or the latest AI tools. \r\nWe are using all our IP. There's a very good validation of our own capabilities that we can accelerate our design process, but really sets up hardware verification on overall verification flow for using the new systems. Now as a result, normally, there is a transition period when you have a new system, and we went through that twice already in the last 10 years and the customers naturally will go to the new systems and then we build them over next 1 or 2 quarters. But that is the right thing to do for the business long term. \r\nIt's good to accelerate the because these AI chips are getting bigger and bigger, right? So the demand for emulation is getting bigger and bigger, and I can give you more stats later. So we felt that it was important to accelerate the development of the next-generation system to get ready for this coming AI wave for next several years, and we are very well positioned. As a result, it does have some impact on quarter-to-quarter, but that's well worth it in the long run.\n\nJoseph D. Vruwink\n\nThat's all very helpful. Second question, I wanted to ask how some of the things you just spoke of, but also AI start to change the frequency of customers engaging with you how they approach renewals. So you brought up how the (inaudible) platforms, the velocity there has improved from first generation to next 6 years, now we're down to a 3-year new product cycle. When I listen to your customers last week talk about AI, they're not just generating ML models that can be reused, but then, of course, each run becomes better if you're incorporating prior feedback.\r\nSo it would just seem like AI itself not only creates stickiness, but there would be an incentive to deploy it maybe more broadly than a customer traditionally would think about deploying new products. Does that mean the average run rate of a renewal ends up becoming much bigger, and we'll start to see that flow in the backlog?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, that's the correct observation. As you know, what we have said before, AI has a lot of profound impact to Cadence, a lot of benefit to our customers. So there are 3 main areas. One is the build-out of the AI infrastructure, whether it's NVDIA or AMD or all the hyperscalers and we are fortunate to be working with all the leading AI companies. So that's the first part. And in that part, as they design bigger and bigger chips, because the big thing in AI systems is they are parallel, so they need to be bigger and bigger chips. So the tools have to be more efficient. The hardware platform have to support that and that's why the new systems. \r\nNow the second part of AI is applying AI to our own products, which is the Cadence.AI portfolio. And like you mentioned last week, we had several customers talking about success with that portfolio, including Intel -- like I mentioned, Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Juniper, ARM. And the results are significant. So we are no longer in kind of a trial phase of whether these things will work. Now we're getting pretty significant improvements. Like we mentioned, MediaTek got like 6% power improvement. One of the hyperscale companies got 8% to 10% power improvement. These are significant numbers. So it is leading to deployment of our AI portfolio. \r\nAnd I think we mentioned like the AI run rate on a trailing 12-month basis is up 3x. Okay. And I think design process already was well automated. EDA has a history of automating design over the last 30 years. So AI is in a unique position because you need the base process to be somewhat automated to apply AI. So we were already well automated, and now AI can take you to the next level of automation. \r\nSo that's the second part of AI, which I'm pretty pleased about is applying to our own product. And then the third part of AI proliferation is new markets that open up, which things like data center design, with Reality that we announced or Millennium, which is designing systems with acceleration or digital biology. Those are like a little -- they take a little longer to ramp up, but we have these 3 kind of impact of AI. The first being direct design of AI chips and systems; second, applying AI to our own products; and third, being new applications of AI.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Charles Shi with Needham & Company.\n\nYu Shi\n\nI just wanted to ask about the China revenue in Q1, it looks pretty light. I just wonder whether that's part of the reason that's weighing on your Q2. I understand you mentioned that you're going to second gen to third gen hardware transition right now, maybe that's another factor. But from geographical standpoint, what's the outlook for China for the rest of the year and specifically Q2?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nCharles, that's a great observation. If you recall this time last year, we were talking about a very strong Q1 for China for functional verification and for upfront revenue. I think those 3 things are often linked. But you contracted with this year, China is down at 12%, upfront revenue is lower at 10% compared to 20% and functional verification, of course, is lapping those really tough comps when we dedicated the 100% production to deliveries. \r\nI think when you look at China, we're blessed that we have the geographical diversification that we have across our business. But the -- what we're seeing in China is strong design activity. And while the percentage of revenue dropped to 12%, it pretty much goes in line with a lower hardware, lower functional verification, lower upfront revenue quarter would generally lead to a lower China percentage quarter. But we have good diversification. And while China is coming down, we could see other Asia increasing and our customer base is really mobile that the geographical mix of revenue is based on consumption and where the products are used. But as we do more upfront revenue in the second half, we'd expect the China percentage to increase.\n\nYu Shi\n\nI want to ask another question about the upcoming ramp of the third-generation hardware. What exactly is the nature of the demand. Is that the replacement demand like your customers replacing your Z2 X2 with the Z3 X3 or expect a lot more great deal of customers adopting Z3 X3? And more importantly, I think you mentioned about 4 to 5x capacity increase that they can design a larger, much larger chips with a lot more transistors. How much of an ASP uplift you are expecting from the Z3 X3 versus Z2 X2?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, Charles, all good observation. So let me try to answer that one by one. So I mean in terms of your last point, we -- normally, if the system has more capacity like this one has, it can do more. So it produces -- it gives more value to our customers. So we are able to get more value back. So typically, newer systems are better that way for us and better for the customer, okay? \r\nAnd to give you an example -- these things are pretty complicated. So let's take Z3, for example. So Z3 itself, we designed this advanced TSMC chip ourselves. And this is one of the biggest ships that TSMC makes. And 1 rack will have like more than 100 of these chips and then we can connect like up to 16 racks together. So if you do that, you have thousands of full radical chips emulating that's -- and these are all liquid cooled, connected by optical and InfiniBand interconnect. \r\nSo this is like a truly a multi-rack supercomputer. And what it can do is just emulate very, very large systems, very, very efficient. So even Z2 like NVIDIA talked about it last week, even Blackwell, which is the biggest chip in the world right now with 200 billion transistors was emulated on fewer racks of Z2, okay? So now with 16 racks of Z3, we can emulate chips, which are like 5x bigger than Blackwell, which is already the biggest chips in the world, right?\r\nSo that gives a lot of runway for our customers because with AI, the key thing is that the capacity of the chip needs to keep going up, not just a single ship, look at Blackwell, they have 2 full radical ships chips on a package. So as you know, you will see more and more, not just big chips on a single node, but multiple chips in a package for this AI workload and also 3D stacking of those chips. \r\nSo what this allows is not just emulating a single large chip but multiple chips, which is super critical for AI, okay? So I think this is what I feel that this puts us in a very good position for all this AI boom that is happening, not just with our partners like NVIDIA and AMD, but also all the hyperscaler companies, okay? \r\nAnd so that will be the primary demand as more capacity chips require more hardware, okay? And then X3 will go for that with software prototyping, which is used on FPGA. \r\nAnd then we have some unique workload capabilities apart from size of these big systems, the capacity being much better in performance. There are new features for low power for analog emulation that helps in the mobile market. So we talked about Samsung working with us, especially on this 4-state emulation, which is a new capability in emulation over the last 10 years. \r\nSo I think it just is a combination of new customers, it's a combination of competitive wins, but also continuing to lead in terms of the biggest chip in the world, which are required for AI processing now and years from now. I think the size of these chips, as you know, is only going to get bigger in the next few years. And we feel that Z3 X3 is already set up for that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley.\n\nLee John Simpson\n\nGreat. And just wanted to go back to what you said last quarter, if I could. It did seem as though you were saying that there was an element of exclusivity around your partnership with ARM -- your EDA partnership around ARM Total Design. I wondered how that was developing, if indeed, you're collaborating to accelerate the development of custom SoCs using Neoverse. It looks as though it's pulled in quite a lot of work or continues to pull in quite a lot of work around functional verification. \r\nAnd I guess as we look at now third generation tool sets for Palladium and Protium, leaving aside some of the rack scale development that we're seeing out there, whether or not ARM's total design, I guess, development work is pulling in or is likely to pull in some of that second half business. And that means not just hyperscalers, but perhaps in AI PCs and beyond?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. Thank you for the question. I mean we are proud to have a very strong partnership with ARM and with our joint customers, ARM and Cadence customers. I think we have had a very strong partnership over the last 10 years, I would like to say. And it's getting better and better. And yes, we talked about our new partnership on total compute. Also, I think this quarter, we talked about our partnership with [Arm Automotive] because what is interesting to see, which, of course, you know this already, but ARM continues to do well in mobile but also now in kind of HPC server and automotive end markets.\r\nSo we are pleased with that partnership, and they are also doing more subsystems and higher order development, and that requires more partnership with Cadence in terms of the back end, Innovus and digital flow and also verification with hardware platforms and other verification tools.\n\nLee John Simpson\n\nGreat. Maybe just a quick follow-up. We've seen quite a bit of M&A activity from yourselves of late, including the IP house acquisition of Invecas. You've had Rambus bought, you've now acquired BETA in the computer-aided emulation space for the car. There's been quite a lot of speculation in the market about the possibility of a transformative deal being done. I guess, given that we have you on the mic here, maybe if we can get a sense from yourself, what would be the sort of thing that a business like Cadence could look for?\r\nWould you look for a high value in a contiguous vertical to what you've already addressed, let's say, in automotive? Or would it be something more waterfront, a business that spans several verticals maybe being more relevant across the industrial software space. Could that be the sort of ambitions that Cadence would have given the silicon-to-systems opportunities that are emerging?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nWell, thank you for the question. And a lot of times, there are a lot of reports, and we normally don't comment on these reports and people get very creative on these reporting. But what I would like to say is that our strategy hasn't changed, okay? It's the same strategy from 2018. \r\nFirst of all, I want to make sure you know that we are focused in our core business, which is EDA and IP. And yes, I launched this whole initiative on systems and it's super critical, chips silicon to systems. \r\nBut what is one thing that I even mentioned last time, what is different from 2018 to now is that EDA and IP is much more valuable to the industry. Our core business itself has become much more valuable because of AI, okay? \r\nSo our first focus is in our core business. So we are leading in our core business. Our first focus is on organic development, okay? That's what we like. We always say that's the best way forward. \r\nNow, along with that, we have done, like you mentioned, some opportunistic M&A, which is usually, I would like to say, is the tuck-in M&A in the past. And that adds to our portfolio. It helped us in system analysis. We also did it in IP because I'm very optimistic about IP growth this year. And we talked about our new partnership with Intel foundry in Q1. Also, we acquired Rambus IP assets, which are HBM and HBM is, of course, a critical technology in AI and we are seeing a lot of growth in HBM this year. Now it's -- we have booked that business, the deliveries will happen towards the second half of the year, as John was saying earlier so that's thing. \r\nNow in terms of BETA, it made sense because it is a very good technology. It's the right size for us, and we are focused on finishing that acquisition and also integrating that, that will take some time. So that's our primary focus in terms of M&A. \r\nAnd it's a very good technology. They have a very good footprint in automotive and aerospace verticals. So just to clarify, we have the same strategy from '18, and that's doing working as well as primarily organic with very synergistic computational software, mostly tuck-in acquisitions.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnirudh, I had a follow-up on the Z3 X3 commentary that you had. And one of the things I was thinking about, especially as you talk about the InfiniBand low latency network across the multiple racks of Z3, you had mentioned that you're up to 85% attach rate of both systems with Z2 X2. I would imagine that would continue to go up. And if you can comment on if the new systems incorporate InfiniBand across Z3 and X3? And if so, do you expect that to be sort of a selling point for your customers that are designing these big chips, which, in many cases, these days have software development attached to the design process. Do you think that the attach rates continue to move higher for both systems?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, absolutely. I think I started this in, I forgot now, '16, I think Dynamic Duo or '15 and '16, which is -- we have a custom processor for Palladium, and we use FPGA for Protium, okay? So this is what we call Dynamic Duo because then Palladium is best-in-class for chip verification and RTL design, and Protium is best-in-class for software bring up, okay, and with the common front end. So as a result, over the years, this has become the right approach, okay? And our customers are fully embracing both these systems as they invariably do both chip development and software development.\r\nI mean perfect example is, of course, our long-term development partner, NVIDIA. I mean NVIDIA is no longer doing just chip development. They have a massive software stack, and that's true for all the hyperscalers. So we see that trend continuing. And now we do use NVIDIA's products like InfiniBand in our systems on Z3 to your question, which is because Z3 is a very unique architecture. So it requires very, very high-speed interconnect. So it's almost like a supercomputer. So then it requires optical and InfiniBand in Z3. Now in X3, we are using AMD FPGAs, which are fabulous, but it does not require that tight interconnect speed. \r\nSo InfiniBand is more used in Z3 versus X3. But X3 is a great system, too. We're using the latest AMD FPGAs. It has 8x higher capacity than X2 and all kinds of innovation on the software side as well. So we are very pleased. I'm very confident that we have true leadership in these hardware platforms, both palladium and Protium. And we're also pleased, like I said earlier, that we are able to refresh it much sooner than the market expected, given our track record, and then we are seeing a lot of demand for both of these systems together going forward.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nThat's helpful. And then a follow-up for John. Anirudh mentioned HBM IP business booked and shipping in second half. I was wondering if you can kind of give us a bigger picture update on how you're viewing IP in general in terms of bookings relative to sort of ramps of those IP sales? Is it sort of the entire segment sort of a second half, should we think about the second half ramping at a heavier weight than first half? Or any update there would be helpful.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. Thanks, Ruben. I mean Q1 IP performance and bookings were ahead of our expectations and everything remains on track there for a very strong growth year for 2024 for the IP business. Of course, the timing of revenue recognition depends on the timing of deliveries. But we had a tremendous bookings quarter in Q1, and we're preparing to scale for a number of deliveries of IP in the second half. But we expect the IP to have a very strong year this year. We're pleased with the overall business momentum, but we need to scale up some head count to prepare to deliver on some of the larger backlog orders.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. One thing I want to highlight. I think you may have seen this. I just want to highlight our partnership with Intel and IFS, okay? That was concluded in Q1. And so it's really good to see [PAT] and Intel investing more in the foundry business and also working more closely with us. So that's also a key contributor to IP. But like John said, we have to hire the people, do the -- we need to put our portfolio to the Intel process, okay? And that takes some time. So that's more will come towards the end of the year and next year. But we are pleased with that new partnership on IP, okay?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nFor you John, first and then Anirudh. So for John, thinking back to a recent conversation we had, could you comment as a measure of EDA market health or dynamics, what you're seeing or expecting in terms of intra contract new or expansion business? This is an ongoing phenomenon in EDA. Maybe talk about what you're seeing in that kind of business beyond the customary renewals schedule? And then relatedly, how are you thinking about pricing for this year, given that EDA generally has substantially better pricing capacity than you might have had in years past? And then my follow-up for Anirudh.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nSure. Thanks, Jay. Great question. Yes, I think what you're getting at there is what we would call add-ons. Typically, we have the very predictable software renewal business. And you'll see in the recurring revenue part of our business, I think we're at double-digit revenue growth. But over the past few years, I think that's been at low teens. But we're seeing that a number of customers that have adopted AI tools are maybe not coming back and purchasing add-ons as frequently.\r\nBut right now, we're focused on proliferating those AI tools into account. I think there's an opportunity to increase pricing there, but maybe now is not the right time. I think we have such strong momentum on the upfront revenue business. We're preparing for scale into the second half there, but we'll have plenty of revenue growth in the second half of the year. We can continue to focus on proliferating our AI tools and technology into accounts. And pricing is something certainly we can focus on more intently in future years. But right now, the focus is on proliferation. Anirudh, do you have anything to add to that? No?\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nOkay. So Anirudh, thinking back to your conference last week, particularly the GenAI track. It was interesting, of course, to hear the adoption presentations by Renesas, Intel and so forth. But what seemed to be taking place is a heavy focus on Cerebrus, which makes sense. It's the one longest end market. So perhaps, you could talk about how you're thinking about the adoption curve for the other brands aside from Cerebrus? And are there any critical parts of the design flow that might not necessarily be amenable to AI enablement. We hear a lot about implementation, analog, verification, but we don't hear a lot about AI as being applicable to synthesis, for example. So maybe talk about those areas where it makes a lot of sense and knows where perhaps it will remain more or less conventional technology?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. Thanks, Jay, for the question. So as you know, we have 5 major AI platforms with Cerebrus and digital implementation being the one that has been out the longest and Cerebrus is doing quite well, like you noted, and we also commented on more than 350 tapeouts, a lot of PPA improvement. But all the other ones are doing well, too. Sometimes we have like too many products, we don't talk enough about the others, but like verification, like Verisium is doing quite well. And I mentioned Qualcomm last week talked about pretty impressive results because verification, as you know, is an exponential problem because as the chips get bigger, the verification task gets exponentially bigger.\r\nSo the benefit of AI can be significant in verification. So I think you will see that in the next few quarters and years that verification will be as important as implementation in terms of benefits of AI, okay? \r\nAnd then the other area I would like to highlight is PCB and Allegro and packaging because that area hasn't seen that much automation in PCB. And Allegro is a leading platform for packaging and PCB, but really proud of Allegro X AI. And we talked about several customers, including Intel last week talked about 4 to 10x improvement using X AI and PCB. So apart from digital, I think the next 2 ones, I feel, are verification and Allegro and PCB. \r\nAnd then the areas that haven't done as well, I mean, is more not in design optimization is like design generation. And I think there, this LLM-based models do provide a lot of promise. So historically, we haven't done as much design generation, this is like almost pre-RTL, right, going from spec to RTL. That's truly the creative part of the design process. And then once you have RTL, it's more optimization part in digital and verification. \r\nSo I think that's where we have to see, but some initial results, which we haven't talked -- I think mentioned last week. But we work with a -- but we have to see it still in early stages, but we work with 1 or 2 customers in which we took like a 40, 50-page spec document, this English document and able to automatically generate RTL from it, okay? And the RTL quality is pretty good. \r\nSo again, we have to see how that goes, but that requires these really advanced LLM capabilities. So that's something to be seen. But if that works well, that could be another kind of very interesting kind of application of GenAI.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nGary Wade Mobley\n\nJohn, I appreciate the fact that China revenue in the first quarter was down against a tough year-ago comp on the hardware verification side as you worked on backlog. And I assume that you still expect China to be dilutive to overall company growth in the fiscal year. Could you speak to whether or not you're starting to see U.S. export controls begin to impact your ability to do business there, whether that be a function of restrictions around gate all around or certain China customers added to the entity list?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nGary, thanks for the question. And just to clarify, I think last quarter, I said I expected China revenue to be flat to down this year. I think we still expect that. And that's because last year was such a strong year, and there was a lot of -- there was kind of an oversized portion of that hardware catch-up that we had that was delivered to China. So I think it skewed the China number higher last year. So we're lapping pretty tough comps. But design activity in China remains very strong, though. We have a lot of diversification. There's strength in other parts of the world. But we're very comfortable with the 2024 outlook and we factored all the impact of geopolitical risk in there to the best we can and try to derisk China as much as we can in our guide.\n\nGary Wade Mobley\n\nOkay. The follow-up, I want to ask about bookings trends for the balance of the year. You obviously highlighted better than seasonal Q1 booking trends. How would you expect the bookings to play out for the balance of the year? And to what extent will Z3 and X3 factor into that for the balance of the year?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. I mean it's hard to predict in terms of Z3 and X3 but we definitely need another quarter to see that. I expect we expect strong demand and we expect strong revenue growth into the -- that we're preparing for scale into the second half on the hardware side, but we need to at least see another quarter of demand. And normally, with hardware, I don't like taking up the year for hardware until I see the pipeline in the summer. But -- so we're trying to be conservative there. But generally, on the hardware side, yes, we're basically preparing for scale. We'll trying to build -- we'll build those systems as quickly as possible. We expect strong demand there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJason Vincent Celino\n\nAnd Anirudh, congrats to your R&D team. Impressed that they reduced the cycle there, all while designing (inaudible), too, right? Maybe first, just how many of the -- for the Z3 and X3, does it become available in Q3? I guess when can customers start putting orders in for that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. First of all, thanks. And yes, they become available in now, okay? And it will ramp Q3 and then Q4. But we already have them running at several early customers. So I mean normally when we announce something, as you know, like -- and one of our lead partners, they have been running for 3 months already and very stable. But in general, it will be more Q3 and then Q4 in terms of -- because normally, in any system, there is like a 3- to 6-month kind of overlap. So we will still sell Z2 X2 and then move to Z3 X3. So that's a natural part. And that's also contributing to this quarter-by-quarter variation a little bit, but it will ramp. And Q3 will be bigger and then Q4 should be bigger than that.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, we try to derisk the guide with the assumption that there's going to be strong demand for the newer systems. But it will give us the opportunity to put some of the older systems into the cloud because we have a large underserved community that want to use our emulation capacity, but we haven't had a lot of capacity to share with them through our cloud offering. To the extent we do that, that will lead to ratable revenue, though, because I think when it's used in the cloud, you get revenue over time, whereas when we deliver and they use it on-prem, we take revenue upfront. Yes, that's it.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nBut the demand it takes like 1 to 2 quarters to ramp.\n\nJason Vincent Celino\n\nOkay. Because that's kind of what I was going to ask next is I think last time in 2021, you had like a 6-month period where you're selling both. And I think you were trying to clear inventory for the Z1 and X1. It doesn't sound like you'll be trying to do that again. Because when I think about this Q2 air pocket, is it a function of customers waiting for Z3 X3? Or is it a function of they might not want to buy the older version?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nWell, the guide -- we've derisk guide on the assumption that many customers might wait. But we intend to sell them side by side. But to the extent the customers wait, it will shift some hardware revenue into the second half of the year. And we've anticipated that. So that's within the guide. To the extent the customers continue to buy Z2, and we're not putting those into the cloud, but selling those outright as well. Well, then that will change the profile or the shape of revenue. But we expect that this new system, the strength of this new system will trigger a lot of demand for it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nI think you mentioned second half growth will be driven a lot more by hardware. Do you think you will see all the benefit of the hardware refresh within this year? Will it be done? Will it continue into '25. I guess my bigger question really is that if I exclude the upfront benefit from last year and this year, your recurring business is expected to grow about 10%.\r\nAnd I'm curious, Anirudh, is that in line with the kind of recurring revenue growth you are expecting or we should be expecting going forward, right, along with periodic hardware refreshes? Or is that not the right way to interpret your core recurring part of your business?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nVery good question. First of all, in nonrecurring, it's not just hardware, but it's also IP in terms of the second half because like we mentioned, we have new IP business driven by HBM and AI and also by Intel IFS. So that is also back-end loaded along with hardware. And then hardware, hardware normally, when we launch a new system, it takes 1 or 2 years for it to fully -- so even though we are not commenting about next year, I'd be surprised if this time, it's only a 6-month impact.\r\nSo I expect like these things is built for to be used in design for next 5, 7 years. So the impact will be also not just this year but following years. And in terms of recurring revenue, I think the best way like we have said is to look at a 3-year CAGR basis because there could be some fluctuation in all. And overall, we are pleased with the recurring revenue growth and we go from there. Yes.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. And Vivek, if I could, I'd like to kind of take -- carry in some of Gary's question earlier that I don't think I addressed because he was asking about the bookings profile for the year. Q2 for software renewals, I think, is our lightest software renewals quarter for the year. But I think we explained last quarter that we expect the weighting of bookings first half to second half to be about 40-60 this year. But the recurring revenue right now in the guide is about double digits, about 10%. And in the past, it's been about 13%. Now we're not really anticipating a huge number of add-ons, but to grow that above 10%. To the extent that, that comes through, it will be upside to the guide. But what we try to do when we do the guide is derisk for the risks that we can see.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nOkay. For my follow-up question on incremental EBIT margin. Do you think this greater mix of hardware is impacting the incremental EBIT margin. I think if I calculate it correctly, the new guidance is still below the 50% incremental, right, or right about, which is lower than what you have had the last 2, 3 years. Is that the right interpretation? And what can change that?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, Vivek, I think what you're referring to really is that, I mean, for what, 7 years in a row now, we think we've been achieving over 50% incremental margins. It's a matter of pride here, We try to achieve that every year, but we'll certainly be trying to achieve that this year. I think we're in the high 40s. It's probably about 47% when you look at this guide right now. I think one of the biggest challenges with something like that is you know, we do small tuck-in M&A, but I don't want to go over Lee Simpson -- the answer Anirudh gave to Lee Simpson but organic is delicious here. At Cadence, we focus on innovation and growing with organically driven products and then with small tuck-in M&A. But to the extent that we do some larger M&A and of course, we have BETA CAE, which apparently is the gold standard in structural simulation. So that's a big acquisition for us. \r\nBut now I think the size of that probably still qualifies as a small tuck-in. But when you do something like that, that those M&A transactions typically are headwinds to that incremental margin calculation in the short term, they will be beneficial in the long term. But in the short term, M&A can be dilutive pretty much in the first year and then becomes accretive later. \r\nWhen we look at our incremental margin. That's a headwind. But we try to overcome that headwind because normally, all we do with these small tuck-in M&As. So I haven't given up on 50% incremental margin for this year. It's a challenge, but we'll do our best to achieve this.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\n\nAfter a strong 2023, SDA is starting the year relatively flattish and down about 5% to 6% sequentially. I think it feels like it's an unusual starting point for SDA, especially given all of the drivers that you guys have articulated. Is SDA expected to also be more second half loaded? And do you expect SDA, this is ex BETA CAE, but do you expect SDA to grow in line or faster than your overall corporate growth target for the full year?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, Harlan. That's a great question. And thanks for highlighting that because I had that on my list of things to say, I think there's something funny going on with the rounding on when you kind of apply the growth rates for SDA for Q1-over-Q1, the actual growth rate is probably high single digits Q1-over-Q1. I know that's lapping tough comps against Q1 '23. I think if you look on a 2-year CAGR basis, I think it's up about 17% per annum on a 2-year CAGR basis for SG&A. But we're expecting strong SG&A growth again this year, and it will be higher than the Cadence average. That's our expectation.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\n\nGreat. And then, Anirudh lots of new accelerated compute AI SoC announcements just even over the past few weeks where we saw flagship Blackwell GPU announcement by one of your big customers, NVIDIA. But we've actually seen even more announcements by your cloud and hyperscale customers bringing their own custom AI ASICs to the market with Google with TPU v5, Google with their Arm-based CPU ASIC, Meta unveiled their Gen 2 TPU AI classes of chips as well. And in addition to that, like their road maps seem to be accelerating. So can you give us an update on your systems and hyperscale customers? I mean are you seeing the design activity accelerating within this customer base? And is the contribution mix from these customers rising above that sort of roughly 45% level going forward?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, Harlan, that's a very good observation. And the pace of AI innovation like is increasing and not just in the big semi companies, but of course, in these system companies. And I think several announcements did come out, right, including, I think now Meta is public that Meta is designing a lot of silicon for AI. And of course, Google, Microsoft, Amazon. So all the big, really hyperscaler companies, along with NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, all the other kind of Samsung had AI phone this year.\r\nSo I mean, there is a lot of acceleration both on the semi side and on the system side. And we are involved with all the major players there, and we're glad to provide our solutions. \r\nAnd I do think -- and this is the other thesis we have talked about for years now, right, 5, 7 years that the system companies will do silicon because of a lot of reasons for customization, for schedule and supply chain control for cost benefits, if there is enough scale. And I think the workload of AI, like if you look at I think some of the big hyperscaler and social media companies, they're talking about using like 20,000, 24,000 GPUs to train these new models. I mean this is immense amount.\r\nAnd then the size of the model and the number of models increased, so that could go to a much, much higher number than right now that is required to train these models and of course, to do inference on these models. So I think we are still in the early innings in terms of system companies developing their own chips and at the same time, working with the semi companies. So I expect that to grow and those -- and our business with the system companies doing silicon, I would like to say is growing faster than Cadence average. But the good thing is the semi guys are also doing a lot of business. So I don't know if that 45% will -- because that's a combination of a lot of companies. But overall, the AI and hyperscalers, they are doing a lot more than so are the big semi company.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn it back over to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nThank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as our broad portfolio and product leadership highly positions us to maximize the growing opportunities in the semiconductor and systems industry. And on behalf of our employees and our Board of Directors, we thank our customers, partners and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's Cadence First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Palantir Stock at a Crossroads: Analyzing the Risks and Rewards for Investors",
        "content": "I have been down on Palantir stock (NASDAQ:PLTR) for some time.\n\nIt is, at its heart, a government contractor. Calling it an AI stock doesn’t change that.\n\nMilitary contracting is a profitable but slow-growth business. Palantir brought almost 10% of last year’s $2.25 billion in revenue to the bottom line.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is always whether it can do better, or grow faster, given the constraints of its business model. Like a political consulting firm, it can only play on one side of the street.\n\nI’m glad it’s our side.\n\nPalantir’s Commercial Arm\n\nThe bull case for Palantir stock has always been built on its commercial contracts.\n\nPalantir has been doing well in hospitals, planning and scheduling people and equipment.\n\nIt makes sense. Hospitals need data security. Palantir’s software can anticipate demand and plan accordingly, faster than people can. It’s not just replacing whiteboards and spreadsheets. It is very much a Machine Internet application.\n\nNow Palantir is exploring a new niche, ad agencies. The idea is that it can use inventory and demand data to optimize ad campaigns, buying ads and adjusting prices to maximize clients’ return. It’s bringing tools first written for logistics into sales and marketing. It’s getting a hearing.\n\nThis may be why the asset manager for Norway’s biggest bank recently cut his positions in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to buy more Palantir.  Bruce Kamich of TheStreet recently hiked his price target to $48 per share. This helped the stock stay hot during the first quarter, rising by over one-third.\n\nBut since April began, it’s down 19%.\n\nThe Bear Claw\n\nAI is one of those Internet buzzwords that make you swoon.\n\nBut isn’t Palantir getting a little ahead of itself, our Louis Navillier asks? Growth isn’t accelerating, nor is it expected to. It will certainly be profitable this year, and could be added to the S&P 500 at any time, forcing index funds to buy it.\n\nBut even if Palantir hits its top earnings estimate of 41 cents per share, you’re paying 49 times that to own it. That’s based on April 19’s closing price of $20.31.\n\nThe nosebleed valuation has some analysts downgrading the stock. Hype cycles, and AI is a hype cycle, are fragile things. Technologies always disappoint before they show their value.\n\nPalantir’s Key Ally\n\nWhile Palantir drew early interest by working with Cloud Czars like Microsoft, its alliance with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) may be more important.\n\nThe two companies are sympatico on a deep level. Oracle was late to the cloud because it remains highly proprietary. Palantir is also highly proprietary.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut getting in late beats not getting in at all. Over the last 2 years Oracle stock is up 50% on the strength of its cloud. Its market cap is up to $315 billion. The deal also puts a floor under Palantir stock. If it falls, Oracle could buy it.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza are very, very good news for Palantir. So is the rise of China. It’s prepared to exploit that through former Congressman Mike Gallagher, one of its new hires.\n\nWar is unhealthy for economies and other living things. It’s also very good for military contractors, especially those on the cutting edge like Palantir.\n\nBut getting Palantir stock to $48/share, or even $30, depends a lot more on its commercial arm than its military wing.\n\nI wouldn’t rush to buy Palantir here. The recent wobble in AI semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may spread. But keep it in mind the next time animal spirits are feeding your view of the market. The long-term view of the business is positive.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA.

        "title": "7 AI Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "If the recent sell-off with artificial intelligence stocks has you thinking that this is a prime “buy the dip” opportunity, think again. What should be top of mind instead is what are the AI stocks to sell.\n\nThere’s a good chance that the AI stock rout of April 19 was not an overreaction, but an appropriate response by the market in light of recent development with top AI software and hardware companies.\n\nUntil now, the market has priced-in continued high growth for the sector as a near certainty. Hence, the reporting of fiscal results that come up even a little short of these expectations causing massive disappointment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s not all. If, one after another, the stocks with the greatest AI-related exposure fall short, a continued AI stock sell-off is likely to have a sharper impact on stocks with more dubious AI catalysts.\n\nSo, in order to take heed of this market warning, what are the AI stocks to sell? Start with these seven.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs recently as March, it may have seemed as if 2024 was going to be Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) “year of AI,” much like 2023 was the “year of AI” for this chip designer’s main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHowever, after surging to $227.30 per share earlier this year, AMD stock has pulled back. The latest AI stock sell-off has led to a further reversal for shares. Before, investors weren’t afraid to bid up AMD, in anticipation of the company beating its own forecasts, regarding sales of its MI300 series of AI accelerators.\n\nNow, the market is erring toward caution. Although Advanced Micro Devices may just well beat its $3.5 billion sales forecast for the MI300, not to mention end up reporting very promising initial numbers for its AI-PC chip sales, stay away as sentiment leans bearish in the near-term.\n\nIntel (INTC) The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.\n\nSource: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a good example of what I was talking about above regarding questionable AI stocks to sell. During the previous fall and winter, investors warmed back up to this chipmaker, due to increased appreciation of its own AI chip catalyst.\n\nThis catalyst joined another existing catalyst, Intel’s build out of its foundry business. With two catalysts in play, the market became very much more confident in a possible INTC stock comeback after years of underperformance. Since then, however, cracks have emerged with the foundry catalyst, as I’ve pointed out previously.\n\nGoing forward, China-related headwinds could keep shares trending lower. It’s also possible that uncertainty about Intel’s initial foray into AI chips increases as well. INTC is no longer priced as if a turnaround is guaranteed. Wait until this stock, trading for 25.2 times forward earnings, once again sports a heavily-discounted valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter looking at two AI hardware stocks, let’s look at Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), which since last year has been one of the hottest AI software stocks out there.\n\nAdmittedly, Palantir has been both aggressive and successful in capitalizing on the generative AI growth trend. At least, based on the enterprise software company’s results from Q4 2023.\n\nEven as PLTR stock has sold off in recent months, Palantir’s AI growth catalyst remains overly baked into its valuation. Shares sell for 62.2 times forward earnings. With shares this pricey, the market may get scared off by any indication of an impending growth slowdown.\n\nSuch an indication could arrive as soon as a few weeks from now post-market on May 6, Palantir next reports earnings. Even if results beat expectations, underwhelming guidance or customer growth numbers could drive a post-earnings plunge.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is one of the top AI stocks to sell. After all, it’s the AI stock that’s driven the aforementioned sharp sell-off.\n\nWhy has the market especially bailed on shares in this AI server builder? Mostly, because the company has decided not to release preliminary quarterly results.\n\nInvestors perceive this to mean disappointment, when Super Micro’s latest fiscal performance and updates to guidance hit the street on April 30.\n\nSMCI stock skeptics have argued that recent growth, boosted by the tech sector’s AI arms race, is likely to slow down. If proven correct, die hard and fair weather bulls alike may bail.\n\nWith this, it is very risky to continue holding a position in SMCI right now. Earnings are just a week away, and those deciding to hold on through earnings could end up “holding the bag,” as shares continue to plummet.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares have been affected somewhat by the AI stock sell-off, but these declines pale compared to massive sell-off shares experienced after the cloud data provider’s most recent quarterly earnings release in late February.\n\nAs I have discussed previously, SNOW stock avalanched lower, due to both weak guidance, as well as an unexpected announcement of a CEO change. Since then, shares have kept declining, as investors walk back expectations. However, with the market sentiment about AI stocks in general shifting toward bearish, look out! Another big avalanche may be in the cards for SNOW shares.\n\nGen AI has been considered a growth catalyst for Snowflake. If the market’s excitement about this trend is declining, a further reassessment for Snowflake’s future growth prospects may soon follow. SNOW trades at a staggeringly-high 152.6 times earnings. This leaves big room for a rerating to the downside.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another example of a speculative name among the AI stocks to sell. As InvestorPlace’s Larry discussed back in February, shares in this voice AI company skyrocketed in price, following news that Nvidia had invested in the company.\n\nFrenzy among meme speculators about SOUN stock persisted through March, yet so far this month, it has declined spectacularly. Initially, because of news of the company’s plans to raise $150 million in capital through an at-the-market equity program. Shares sold off in response to the dilutive impact that this capital raise will have.\n\nThe broad sell-off in AI stocks is placing more pressure on SOUN. A market more cautious about AI plays likely means further big downside ahead. Even as this upstart still has Nvidia in its corner, as this $3.25 stock could quickly return to pre-meme prices of under $2 per share, stay away.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) had a rough go of it this week. First, following the leading chip foundry’s latest earnings release on April 18, shares experienced a modest decline.\n\nDespite what was a solid earnings report overall, investors focused on the major negatives with the release.\n\nNamely, downbeat statements from management about overall chip demand this year. Then, TSM stock sank again on April 19. This time, because of the market jitters related to Super Micro Computer spilling over to other chip stocks. In the immediate term, further fears about an AI chip demand slowdown could place more pressure on TSM.\n\nAlso, don’t forget that there’s the “known unknown” of a possible China-Taiwan conflict eventually happening. TSM’s valuation of just 20 times forward earnings may not fully account for all of these risks. With this, consider it best to sell and sit on the sidelines for now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThis week, companies collectively worth nearly $17 trillion will report quarterly results. Next week, almost $13 trillion in market cap will follow.\n\nBut the breadth and depth of corporate earnings set to be released don't make this week or next the biggest week for first quarter earnings season.\n\nThat crown will be worn in a month's time when Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings on May 22.\n\nBy the time the Kentucky Derby gets underway on May 4, 341 companies in the S&P 500 will have told investors how their first three months of 2024 went, data from Bespoke Investment Group showed.\n\nCombine this with PCE inflation data this Friday, next Wednesday's Fed meeting, and the April jobs report on May 3, and just about every piece of key data for markets will get a moment in the spotlight over the next two weeks.\n\nBut part of what makes Nvidia's report next month more important than this cluster is that it stands alone on the calendar. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META), for instance, all report results this week.\n\nShould these reads on the growth of AI within their product lineups or shifts in the digital advertising market conflict with one another, investors can choose their own way in or out of the story. The next two weeks will see most of the market's biggest companies report earnings. Results from Nvidia in May will be even more important for investors. (Source: Bespoke Investment Group)\n\nNvidia and the AI trade have also shown signs of some fragility after powering markets higher and papering over investor fears around rising rates for much of this year.\n\nLast week, investors got a look at just how sensitive the AI trade has become.\n\nASML (ASML), which makes the technology that allows chip companies to make better, more advanced chips, reported bookings on Wednesday that disappointed. Shares fell 8%.\n\nTSMC (TSM) the next day reported results that left investors wanting, with Bloomberg noting the company cut expectations for overall chip growth this year and said \"macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty\" could weigh on end-market demand. Its stock lost 5%.\n\nOn Friday, news from Super Micro Computer (SMCI) that the company would report results next week but would not pre-announce performance for investors was cited by analysts as enough to trigger a 19% drop in the stock.\n\nIn the background of these negative surprises from the chip space, market leaders like AMD (AMD), Micron (MU), and, of course, Nvidia have seen their stock prices come under pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings period, expectations were high.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer wrote Monday, these forecasts have created early challenges for companies that aren't being rewarded for beating estimates and are being judged harshly for falling short.\n\nMoreover, all earnings periods bring with them an inherent instability. Everyone knows when a company will release a material update on its business, and the votes come in up or down.\n\nAnd when we combine a calendar-provided spotlight with Nvidia's centrality to the AI narrative underpinning the market's rally, it seems that the busiest weeks of earnings season might not, after all, be the most important.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 High-Octane Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Over the past three decades, Wall Street has never been at a loss for next-big-thing investment trends or innovations that could change the growth trajectory for the U.S. and global economy. Seemingly nothing has rivaled the advent of the internet, in terms of game-changing growth potential, until the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution came along.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI involves the use of software and systems for tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. Giving software and systems the ability to learn and evolve over time (i.e., machine learning capabilities) without human intervention means AI has theoretical utility in almost every sector and industry. It's why the analysts at PwC estimate AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nWhen big numbers like this get tossed around, Wall Street's brightest minds take notice. But while billionaires have been eager to take advantage of the rise of AI by putting their money to work in high-octane growth stocks, they've also not been shy about reducing their stakes in what I've come to refer to as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire investors are showing the most-direct AI beneficiary to the door\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from artificial intelligence than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units are the \"brains\" in AI-accelerated data centers that power split-second decision-making by AI-driven software and systems. By some estimates, Nvidia controls a 90% or greater share of all AI-GPUs deployed in high-compute enterprise data centers.\n\nDespite this dominance, eight prominent billionaire investors reduced their respective fund's stakes in Nvidia during the December-ended quarter. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, these eight billionaire sellers include (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nWhile profit-taking in the top-performing megacap stock of 2023 may be one explanation why more than a half-dozen billionaires sent Nvidia to the chopping block, a flurry of headwinds provides further detail.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia recorded 217% sales growth for its Data Center segment. Most of this growth was driven by higher prices for its A100 and H100 GPUs, as evidenced by a substantially smaller 43% increase in cost of revenue (across all operating segments) from the previous year. With new competition entering the space, and Nvidia increasing the production of its own chips, GPU scarcity should be less of a talking point by the latter half of this year. As Nvidia's pricing power weakens, so will its gross margin.\n\nTo add to this, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for roughly 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-focused GPUs of their own. Although these chips are being used to complement Nvidia's GPUs, it more than likely signals a peak in orders from these four \"Magnificent Seven\" customers.\n\nBillionaires might also be displeased with the lack of assistance Nvidia is getting from U.S. regulators. Nvidia developed AI-GPUs specifically for the Chinese market -- the A800 and H800 -- after an initial round of export restrictions. Unfortunately, U.S. regulators hit Nvidia with a new round of export curbs last year that also affected the A800 and H800.\n\nLastly, history hasn't been kind to next-big-thing investment trends. Since the advent of the internet, every \"can't-miss\" trend has endured an early-stage bubble. History strongly suggests AI won't be the exception. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nWhile top-tier billionaires were busy selling shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, they were eager buyers of two hypergrowth companies with AI ties. The first of those two is data-mining juggernaut Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Per 13Fs, four successful billionaires purchased shares, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (10,669,404 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,553,432 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,279,138 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,028,089 shares)\n\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia (Englander, Laffont, and Yass) were some of the biggest buyers of Palantir stock in the December-ended quarter.\n\nThe top reason to buy shares of Palantir is that the company, at scale, is irreplaceable. Palantir's AI-driven Gotham platform assists federal governments with data collection and mission planning, among other tasks. Meanwhile, Foundry is a platform used by businesses to help them make sense of their data in order to streamline their operations. There is no one-for-one replacement for what Palantir offers federal governments and businesses through its portfolio of services.\n\nFor years, Gotham has been Palantir's primary growth driver. The government contracts Palantir wins are often spread out over four or five years, which leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.\n\nHowever, Gotham's long-term ceiling is somewhat limited. There are certain governments around the world that Palantir's management team won't allow to use it AI-driven platform. This is what makes the company's burgeoning Foundry platform so important for future growth.\n\nLast year, commercial revenue grew by 20% to $1 billion, with commercial sales in the U.S. rising by 36%. More importantly, commercial customer count jumped 44% to 375. While a 44% uptick is impressive, the fact that Palantir only has 375 commercial clients shows how early it is in its enterprise-focused expansion phase.\n\nIt's pretty evident that billionaires are enticed by the long-term prospects of Palantir's Foundry segment.\n\nSalesforce\n\nThe other high-octane growth stock with artificial intelligence ties that billionaires were buying during the December-ended quarter is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). A half-dozen top-notch billionaires purchased shares of Salesforce, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,144,062 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (736,986 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (533,187 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (198,007 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (97,603 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (89,045 shares)\n\nAs with Palantir, Laffont, Englander and Yass were buyers of Salesforce stock and sellers of Nvidia shares.\n\nSalesforce is the global leader in cloud-based CRM solutions. For those unfamiliar, CRM software helps consumer-facing businesses handle everything from simple data-entry tasks to running complex models to determine which customers would be likeliest to purchase a new product or service. It deploys AI to handle repetitive tasks, such as data entry, so customer service representatives are free to handle more complex issues.\n\nAccording to IDC, Salesforce's CRM applications have been ranked No. 1 in global market share for 10 consecutive years, through the first half of 2023. In fact, its four closest competitors don't even add up to its market share of worldwide CRM solutions. With its position atop the CRM leaderboard safe, double-digit year-over-year sales growth is the expectation.\n\nManagement has also helped the company by making regular, earnings-accretive, bolt-on acquisitions. Under the guidance of co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff, Salesforce has completed a number of buyouts, including Slack Technologies and Tableau Software. These deals are expanding its service ecosystem and providing more cross-selling opportunities for Salesforce.\n\nEven if the AI bubble were to burst, Salesforce's immense moat in CRM would insulate it from the downdraft.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "TSMC Just Gave Investors Another Reason to Be Bullish on Nvidia",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted its first-quarter report on April 18. Its revenue rose 13% year over year to $18.9 billion and its earnings grew 5% to $1.38 per American depositary receipt (ADR). Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations.\n\nHowever, TSMC followed up its earnings beat with a cautious outlook for the industry. It reduced its full-year revenue forecast for the broader semiconductor market (excluding memory chips) from \"more than 10%\" growth to \"approximately 10%\" and cut its outlook for the foundry market from \"approximately 20%\" to \"mid-to-high teens\" growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThose comments immediately caused many semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), to tumble. But if we dig a bit deeper, we'll see that TSMC's earnings report actually featured good news for Nvidia, so the AI chipmaker's recent pullback might represent a great buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nWhy is TSMC's report a green flag for Nvidia's future?\n\nTSMC reined in its expectations for the semiconductor sector, but it still reiterated its own revenue guidance for \"low to mid-20%\" growth for the full year, which matches analysts' prediction of a 21% boost. TSMC is still bullish on its own prospects because it expects the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market to offset the persistent weakness of the PC and smartphone markets. In other words, the growth of the AI market will still drive Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), and other chipmakers to ramp up their production of high-end data center GPUs at TSMC.\n\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC was still experiencing a \"surge in AI-related demand\" and predicted its revenue from server AI processors would \"more than double this year\" and account for a \"low-teens\" percentage of its full-year sales. Wei also predicted the AI processor market would continue expanding at a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, account for over a fifth of its top line by 2028, and become the \"largest contributor\" to its overall revenue growth.\n\nThose all seem like bright green flags for TSMC's top client. Nvidia dominates the booming market with its high-end data center GPUs for processing AI tasks. During Nvidia's last conference call in February, CFO Colette Kress said the demand for its latest data center GPUs \"far exceeds\" its available supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy did Nvidia's stock sink after TSMC's report?\n\nTSMC's outlook is clearly bullish for Nvidia, but three factors seemed to cause Nvidia's stock to drop. First, short-sighted investors were likely looking for any reasons to take profits after Nvidia's massive rally. Even after its recent dip, it remains up more than 170% over the past 12 months and nearly 400% over the past three years.\n\nSecond, many trading algorithms, ETFs, and institutional investors buy and sell sectors in entire bunches instead of focusing on individual companies. So when a chip bellwether like TSMC delivers imperfect results, it can sink the entire sector.\n\nFinally, the macro environment remains unpredictable. A hotter-than-expected inflation report for March is dampening hopes for quick interest rate cuts, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East is driving up commodity prices. These challenges could be driving investors away from Nvidia and other higher-growth tech stocks.\n\nBut it could be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors\n\nNevertheless, investors who can look past those near-term challenges should consider Nvidia's pullback to be a golden buying opportunity. Back in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively. That growth was mainly driven by the expansion of its data center business.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase another 82% and 89%, respectively, as the AI market continues to evolve. It obviously can't maintain those hypergrowth rates forever, but TSMC's optimistic five-year outlook for the AI arena suggests it still has plenty of room to run.\n\nAt $760, Nvidia stock trades for just 31 times this year's adjusted earnings. AMD, which is growing at a slower pace, trades at 44 times forward earnings. That reasonable valuation makes Nvidia a compelling buy for patient investors right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget SoundHound AI: 3 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "New technologies are exciting, but investors chasing the next big trend can get burned. Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the hottest thing on Wall Street in some time. Hype over its potential has played a significant role in driving the stock prices of many companies connected to the industry higher since last year -- among them, SoundHound AI, an AI company focused on audio technology.\n\nI'm not saying that SoundHound AI won't succeed over the long term, but it's carrying a $1 billion market cap and did less than $50 million in revenue last year. Perhaps investors should look for AI companies that are more mature, with higher floors and enough potential to deliver outstanding returns -- companies, for example, like Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and UiPath(NYSE: PATH).\n\n1. Palantir's customer acquisition momentum is picking up steam\n\nAI may be a hot buzzword, but it's not an out-of-the-box technology. To make use of it, companies have to develop, train, and implement specific applications. That's where Palantir Technologies has a tremendous opportunity. The software company enables customers to build and deploy custom software applications, including AI, into their businesses via its Gotham, Foundry, and AIP platforms.\n\nPalantir has a long history as a U.S. government contractor -- Washington was its primary customer in its early years. Today, Palantir maintains strong government ties, but has been expanding rapidly into the private sector. The company's commercial customer base is growing at an accelerated pace. Palantir ended 2023 with 221 U.S. commercial accounts, a 55% year-over-year increase. Its customer count had grown 34% year-over-year in the third quarter.\n\nThe long-term opportunity here is tremendous. Palantir's ability to win large government contracts, including a recent $178 million U.S. Army project, underlines the value its tech can add to an organization. In the private sector, there are more than 350,000 companies with at least 250 employees (large businesses) worldwide, enough potential prospects to feed its growth for years.\n\n2. Nvidia is giving long-term investors an entry point\n\nGraphics processing unit (GPU) maker Nvidia is arguably one of the fundamental AI stocks. The company has exploded in value over the past few years due to its dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia's GPUs can handle the hefty computing workloads involved in training and operating AI models. Its dominant position in providing that hardware is reflected in its results: In Q4, its data center revenue grew by 409% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLisa Su, CEO of its archrival, AMD, predicts the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion by 2027. Nvidia's full-year run-rate for data center revenue (based on its Q4 result) is $72 billion, so it should have large opportunities ahead as the market expands, even if competitors chip away at in its estimated 90% market share in AI silicon. Of course, optimists could also argue: What if those competitors don't make a significant dent in Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI chip market?\n\nThe broader stock market has gotten a bit shaky recently, and Nvidia has fallen by 20% from its peak. Shares now look relatively attractive at a forward P/E ratio of 32, considering that, on average, analysts believe its earnings could grow by more than 30% annually for the next three to five years. Investors shouldn't jump in too hard, but nibbling on Nvidia as it dips seems like a sound long-term bet for investment gains.\n\n3. UiPath is a sneakily good automation stock\n\nWhen people think of AI systems replacing humans, visions of Hollywood movie robots may spring to mind. UiPath's business actually is in that ballpark, but its software does all the heavy lifting. It specializes in robotic process automation (RPA) software, which learns how to perform repetitive tasks like filling out or filing forms or sorting data. This software can replace human effort for mundane but necessary tasks, freeing up people to handle work that requires more creativity and flexibility.\n\nAccording to third-party rankings such as Gartner's Magic Quadrant, UiPath is the leader in RPA software. One telltale sign of a great business is when customers use more of its products or services over time. The company's 119% net revenue retention rate shows that its established customers are increasing their spending with it. That's easy growth for the company to benefit from that doesn't require it to add new clients. But UiPath is adding new customers, so its revenue grew by 24% in 2023.\n\nUiPath is profitable, and its revenue growth should trickle down to the bottom line. On average, analysts believe UiPath will grow earnings by more than 22% annually for the next three to five years. That's a solid growth rate for a business trading at 33 times its 2024 earnings estimates. If you believe that AI and automation will continue to play a bigger role in the global workforce, it's hard not to feel optimistic about the outlook for UiPath.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive-China acquired recently banned Nvidia chips in Super Micro, Dell servers, tenders show",
        "content": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Max A. Cherney\n\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese universities and research institutes recently obtained high-end Nvidia artificial intelligence chips through resellers, despite the U.S. widening a ban last year on the sale of such technology to China.\n\nA Reuters review of hundreds of tender documents shows 10 Chinese entities acquired advanced Nvidia chips embedded in server products made by Super Micro Computer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and Taiwan's Gigabyte Technology Co Ltd after the U.S. on Nov. 17 expanded the embargo to subject more chips and countries to licensing rules.\n\nSpecifically, the servers contained some of Nvidia's most advanced chips, according to the previously unreported tenders fulfilled between Nov. 20 and Feb. 28. While the U.S. bars Nvidia and its partners from selling advanced chips to China, including via third parties, the sale and purchase of the chips are not illegal in China.\n\nThe 11 sellers of the chips were little-known Chinese retailers. Reuters could not determine whether, in fulfilling the orders, they used stockpiles acquired before the U.S. tightened chip-export restrictions in November.\n\nContacted by Reuters, Nvidia said the tenders specify products that were exported and widely available before the restrictions. \"They do not indicate that any of our partners violated the export control rules and are a negligible fraction of the products sold worldwide,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe server makers said they complied with applicable laws or would investigate further.\n\nAmong the buyers were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute, Hubei Earthquake Administration, the Shandong and Southwest universities, a tech investment firm owned by the Heilongjiang provincial government, a state-run aviation research centre, and a space science centre.\n\nNone of the Chinese buyers and retail sellers responded to questions from Reuters about the matter.\n\nDaniel Gerkin, a Washington-based partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, said Nvidia chips could have been diverted to China without a manufacturer's knowledge, given a lack of visibility into downstream supply chains.\n\nIf the manufacturer had performed sufficient due diligence, \"it presumably would be challenging for the U.S. government to pursue an enforcement action\", he said.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters it could not comment on any potential ongoing investigations, but said its Bureau of Industry and Security monitored diversions of restricted chips, conducted end-use checks and examined potential breaches.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials would investigate credible allegations of violations, including through the use of shell companies, a spokesperson said.\n\nNvidia said systems built with its graphic processing units (GPUs) - chips that break computer tasks into smaller pieces and process them together - and resold by third parties must comply with U.S. restrictions.\n\n\"If we determine that any product was subsequently resold in violation of U.S. export control rules, we'll work with our customers to take appropriate action,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSuper Micro said it complied with U.S. requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses.\n\n\"If we become aware that a third party has exported or reexported without the required licenses, we investigate the matter and take appropriate action,\" it said.\n\nIn a letter to Reuters on behalf of Super Micro, U.S. law firm Clare Locke said its client \"goes above and beyond what U.S. export restrictions require\" by proactively taking steps to ensure its customers do not violate the curbs.\n\nIn relation to the tenders that identified its products, Super Micro said they represent \"older generation or general purpose servers not capable of the largest scale AI operations that were available in China prior to the export control regulations\". The awarded suppliers \"are not known Supermicro customers\", the company said.\n\nA Dell spokesperson said the company \"found no evidence of shipping products configured with the restricted chips you listed to the entities you named\", but that it would continue to investigate.\n\n\"Our distributors and resellers are required to comply with all applicable global regulations and export controls. If we become aware of a distributor or reseller that is not complying with these obligations, we take appropriate actions, including termination of our relationship,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nGigabyte said in an email that it complied with Taiwanese laws and international regulations. It did not respond to subsequent questions about tenders that identified its products as a source of banned Nvidia chips. Taiwan's economy ministry said it expected Taiwanese companies to respect U.S. export controls.\n\nRESEARCH BENEFITS\n\nThe transactions were disclosed in a dozen of the tenders, which Reuters found on public databases that cover only a fraction of purchases by China's state entities. But the small snapshot shows China still has access to advanced chips that U.S. officials say could support AI for military applications, such as the modernisation of China's defence forces or for developing weapons like hypersonic missiles.\n\nEach of the purchases were limited to several servers and several dozen banned chips. Still, they could be useful for training models and conducting advanced research, according to seven analysts and industry executives.\n\nThe tenders - valued at between 71,500 yuan and 1.86 million yuan, or about $10,000 and $259,000 - did not specify the intended uses.\n\nUnder Chinese law, procuring agencies representing state or state-affiliated buyers must check that a supplier can fulfil the tender before it is announced as the winner and a contract is signed.\n\nReuters only analysed tenders whose winners had been announced.\n\nCompanies and people accused of violating U.S. export controls can face civil or criminal penalties in the U.S., including fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and up to 20 years in prison for individuals.\n\nReuters last year reported that an underground trade in Nvidia chips had emerged in China, as evident at Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei electronics market in June, before the U.S. widened its curbs. On a return visit in December, the vendors who had spoken to Reuters months earlier had gone, and other sellers said they did not know why they left.\n\nReuters couldn't establish why the vendors were no longer at the market.\n\n($1 = 7.1932 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Cherney reported from San Francisco.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 253.58 points, or 0.67%, to 38,239.98.\n\nMegacap growth stocks ended higher, with gains in Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple between 0.5% and 1.5%. Nvidia gained 4.4% to rebound from a 10% drop in the previous session.\n\n\"This is predicated on positive technical expectations on tech earnings and traders not wanting to be short in front of it, and the PCE numbers later this week that people are somewhat sanguine about as well,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital in New York.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla shares dropped 3.4% as the electric vehicle maker cut prices in a number of its major markets, including China and Germany, following price reductions in the United States.\n\nCardinal Health fell 5% after the drug distributor said its contracts with UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx, one of its largest customers, will not be renewed when they expire at the end of June.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 49 new highs and 76 new lows on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,682 stocks rose and 1,499 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.79-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 184 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.33 billion shares, compared with the 11.03 billion average for the last 20 days.\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Additional reporting by Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "TSMC Topped Estimates On The Back Of Insatiable AI Demand",
        "content": "TSMC Topped Estimates On The Back Of Insatiable AI Demand\n\nLast Thursday, the world’s largest producer of advanced processors issued its first quarter results and they were even better than expected as AI demand continues to go strong. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM), whose customers include the AI chip leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) as well as the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), expects 2024 to be another year of healthy growth on the back of its technology leadership and broad customer base that also includes Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, TSMC reported net revenue grew 16.5% YoY to NT$592.64 billion. Net income rose 8.9% YoY to NT$225.49 billion.\n\nThe net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, while an industry average is about 14%, reflecting TSMC’s competitiveness.\n\nNvidia Set To Become The TSMC Of AI\n\nEarlier in March, Nvidia clearly stated its aim to become the TSMC for AI as it continues its expansion beyond hardware, entering into software services. During its annual conference, GTC 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangunveiled new tools. In terms of AI development, Nvidia aims to do for the world exactly that what TSMC does for the AI chip leader by turning its design and concept into physical chips. Therefore, TSMC builds the chips Nvidia, Apple and others need and Nvidia wants to become the AI maker, turning concepts of its clients into a model they get to bring with them.\n\nSecond Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, TSMC is supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, but this strength is partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality. TSMC guided for second-quarter revenue in the range between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. Due to the recent earthquake in Taiwan along with higher electricity costs, TSMC expects the second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint. Fortunately, the earthquake that occurred on April 3rd did not cause any power shortages, nor structural damage to the company’s facilities and critical tools such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. One of its closest competitors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), lost the lead because TSMC was the first to adopt EUV lithography systems that are essential for its leadership. Although some wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, most of the lost production should be recovered in current quarter, with minimal impact to revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nWith AI demand going strong, TSMC managed to weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand, fueling its stock to new heights. In 2025, TSMC is planning to begin mass-producing its 2-nanometer chips, which come with more power and efficiency compared to its current 3-nanometer ones. As for the full year, TSMC estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than double. For the full year, TSMC guided for low to mid-20% revenue growth under the assumption that the AI market continues to expand while the PC market stabilizes, and the smartphone market returns to growth amid an improved macroeconomic backdrop. Although TMSC might not keep the pace with Nvidia in terms of near-term gains due to the fact its business goes beyond chips, it certainly won’t be in a recovery mode like its client, Qualcomm, after the 2023 lulled the smartphone market to sleep. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter results on May 1st. Best known for making smartphone chips, Qualcomm did surpass estimates with its fiscal first quarter financials and its upcoming report should reflect the business picking up as smartphone sales continue to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Lynch used the term in his 1988 book, \"One Up on Wall Street,\" in which he discussed his strategies to identify stocks with the potential to be multibaggers or even ten or twenty-baggers.\n\nPrior Multibaggers Still Making Strides\n\nLast year in July, we made a list of the best multibagger stocks which included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). These three stocks have been moving on an upward trajectory and even after nine months, they continue to make their investors a lot of money.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been topping charts since the rise of generative AI.

DoorDash is a technology-driven marketplace that enables couriers (Dashers) to deliver restaurant and other local orders on-demand to consumers. The company is a market leader in restaurant delivery, a business that continues to gain US market share (with healthy margins) and grow internationally. At the same time, heavy investment in newer businesses has limited company profitability. Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability—something it is not getting credit for by the market. The future near-term profit trajectory from new businesses is unclear, but we view management as very rational with its spending. Either these initiatives will yield additional profitable revenue streams, or they will be deprioritized in the coming years—in both scenarios, we expect solid profit growth over time.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Countries with the Largest Rural Population in the World 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now 10 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of NVIDIA fell 13.6% last week and are down about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.\r\n\r\nApple and Microsoft MSFT lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. First-quarter earnings for Magnificent Seven are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nProfits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\r\n\r\nHere, we discuss three companies from the Magnificent Seven — Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — that are set to release earnings this week.  Meta Platforms will report on Apr 24, while Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%). Shares of META have surged about 22% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -3.36% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter.

Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nAlphabet\r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Fall 19% and 65%, According to a Pair of Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are suddenly seeing red. The segment plunged last week after a pair of earnings-driven declines from ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor, two leaders in semiconductor manufacturing, sparked a broader sell-off.\n\nOn Friday, one analyst questioned Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) decision not to release preliminary revenue results, even though it had become a custom, and that led to a bloodbath. Supermicro stock finished the session down 23%, Arm Holdings lost 17%, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) finished the day down 10%.\n\nIs the AI bubble bursting, or is this just a temporary sell-off? No one knows the answer to that question, but a pair of Wall Street analysts think two top AI stocks, Nvidia and Supermicro, are both headed lower. Keep reading to see why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia: 19% downside\n\nNvidia has been the undisputed leader in the AI boom. While OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI race, Nvidia has raked in the bulk of the industry profits thus far, as sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) and related components form the backbone of the infrastructure that makes AI apps, like ChatGPT, work.\n\nNvidia's revenue has tripled in recent quarters, driven by soaring AI demand, and its profits have grown even more rapidly. However, one analyst thinks that Nvidia could have further to fall after Friday's sell-off.\n\nDA Davidson's Gil Luria weighed in on Nvidia stock after the company's February earnings report with a neutral rating and a price target of $620. This implied a decline of 21% at the time, or 19% from Friday's close.\n\nLuria acknowledged that Nvidia delivered strong results and is in a position to continue dominating the AI compute space, but he also expects the company's competitors to catch up. The analyst sees a chance that Nvidia's demand will decline in the next four to six quarters.\n\nCompetition is indeed coming for Nvidia, as AMD and Intel have both launched competing AI GPUs. However, it's still too early to tell if they'll take significant market share from Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's growth rate is certain to slow in the coming quarters as it will face more difficult comparisons, but the Wall Street consensus calls for strong growth to continue. If revenue were to decline as Luria seems to imply, at least in some categories, the stock would almost certainly plunge.\n\n2. Supermicro: 65% downside\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro has been a big winner from the AI boom. The maker of high-density servers, which work especially well for running AI applications, has skyrocketed since the beginning of 2023. Its revenue is also soaring, up more than 100% in its most recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, not every analyst is sold on Supermicro's potential. Susquehanna rated the stock a sell, with a price target of just $250 after the company's earnings report at the end of January. This implies a 65% decline in the stock from its current price.\n\nThe research firm acknowledged the secular growth in AI compute but saw a number of problems with the company's results. For example, despite soaring revenue growth, Supermicro's gross margin declined, which Susquehanna sees as a lack of leverage in its business model. It also noted a demanding working capital requirement, which may have led to the company's decision to raise $2 billion in March. Susquehanna also questioned the overall quality of the company's earnings.\n\nThe Friday sell-off in Supermicro shares could portend greater problems for the company if its third-quarter earnings report disappoints. Investors are expecting another surge in revenue when it reports earnings on April 30.\n\nIt would be a surprise for the company to miss its own guidance from late January, as there are still high expectations baked into the stock. Regardless of the numbers, investors should expect the volatility in Supermicro's stock to continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNvidia NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of Nvidia fell 13.6% last week and are down sharply, about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.

Amazon AMZN shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics and computing and networking solutions. On April 19, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $762.00 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -19.79%, and its shares gained 181.78% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.905 trillion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share.

        "content": "The magnificent 7 stocks — Tesla TSLA, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and NVIDIA NVDA — are set to report their quarterly results in a few days.\r\n\r\nThese megacap stocks were the top performers in 2023 and have continued to outperform the market except for Apple and Tesla, shares of which have declined 14.3% and 40.8%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, MSFT, META, NVDA, AMZN and GOOGL have returned 6.2%, 35.9%, 53.9%, 15% and 10.3%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the magnificent 7 have continued to dominate the S&P 500 with a weightage of 29.7% as of Apr 17, per Datatrek research, as cited by Investors’ Business Daily.

This marked the first year-over-year drop in quarterly deliveries since 2020.\r\n\r\nThe decline was due to “the early phase of the production ramp-up” of its updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory and plant shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, which led to a weeklong production halt in its Germany factory.

        "title": "Why the Magnificent 7's 'momentum is collapsing'",
        "content": "The run may be over for the seven stocks that drove the lion's share of the stock market rally over the past year.\n\nUBS Investment Bank Chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub downgraded six of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) — from Overweight to Neutral in a new research note on Monday.\n\nHis call comes as the Magnificent 7, whichalso includes Tesla (TSLA), just had its largest weekly market cap loss in history. All seven of the big tech leaders are off their recent highs, as highlighted by a 10% single day-drawdown for Nvidia, its worst one day price performance since March 2020.\n\nGolub, who rates sectors within the S&P 500 (^GSPC) not individual stocks, remains Overweight on technology outside of the six stocks he names in his note. But for the large companies who have grown earnings significantly over the past year, Golub believes the tide may be shifting, and other areas are set to outperform the largest stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Investors attribute the run in mega cap stocks to animal spirits and the impact of AI,\" Golub wrote. \"However, our work indicates that surging earnings momentum (change in forward growth projections) fueled this upside. Unfortunately, this momentum is collapsing.\"\n\nTesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nEarnings for the S&P 500 have largely been driven by earnings growth in the large tech stocks. That's expected to play out again during first quarter reports, with FactSet projecting Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia to combine for earnings growth of roughly 64%. Meanwhile the other 495 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report an earnings decline of 6%.\n\nBut over the course of the year, this is expected to shift. Consensus estimates from FactSet show earnings for those five companies are set to end the year with just shy of 20% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly slower growth than their prior pace. By that point, consensus expects the other 495 companies to be growing earnings by about 17% compared to the year prior, a significant uptick from their current growth rate.\n\n\"Our downgrade of the Big 6—from Overweight to Neutral—is not predicated on extended valuations, or doubts about AI,\" Golub wrote. \"Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks. These forces do not apply to other TECH+ companies or the rest of the market in the same way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift in where earnings are growing the most could be \"disruptive in the near term,\" Golub said. But given increasing signs that the US economy is growing faster-than-expected this year, Golub thinks a broadening out in earnings performance over the next year keeps his 5,400 call on the S&P 500 to end the 2024 in play.\n\n\"This target remains supported by broadly positive fundamentals and a robust economy,\" Golub wrote.

        "title": "10 Best Performing Biotech ETFs in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best performing biotech ETFs in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed introduction to the biotech industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Performing Biotech ETFs in 2024.\n\nBiotechnology is a challenging field, not ideal for the faint of heart. Companies within this sector often utilize biological components in their product development which require hefty investments. Consequently, biotechnology stocks are notorious for their high-risk levels, making them some of the most volatile assets in the stock market. The prices of these equities can experience dramatic fluctuations, influenced by the outcomes of Food & Drug Administration (FDA) clinical trials and the performance of their treatments in real-world scenarios. In 2020, the biotechnology industry gained significant attention amid the pandemic, particularly with the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines by companies like Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). However, as society adapted to living with COVID-19 and other economic and political issues came to the forefront, interest in biotech waned.\n\nWith that said, the Financial Times reports that in January of this year, drug developers amassed $6 billion in equity capital markets, marking the highest total since February 2021—when biotech stocks peaked. This uptick indicates a robust recovery from a challenging two-year period, during which many companies struggled financially, resulting in layoffs, halted projects, and, in some cases, closures. A key factor driving this resurgence in biotech investments is the overall improvement in stock market performance. After a period of volatility and declines, the stock market has stabilized and begun to exhibit signs of growth. This stability has bolstered investor confidence, prompting a renewed interest in the biotech sector. Notably, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) has experienced a significant rebound, climbing 40% since October, underscoring investors' renewed enthusiasm for biotech stocks.\n\nSee also: 10 Biotech Stocks with Huge Potential\n\nAmid increasing healthcare demands, there has been a notable emphasis on personalized medicine and innovative therapies, fueling the expansion of the biotech industry. Additionally, government initiatives aimed at modernizing regulations and improving reimbursement policies are further bolstering market growth. According to IQVIA, global spending on medications is projected to reach $2.30 trillion by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% to 8%. Oncology and obesity are expected to drive this growth, while spending on immunology may slow due to the introduction of biosimilars. Biotech is anticipated to represent 39% of total spending, surpassing $892 billion by 2028, with cell and gene therapies experiencing rapid growth rates. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery and development has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing traditional approaches and enhancing efficiency throughout the pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) process. For example, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently unveiled partnerships with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to integrate generative AI into surgical procedures and with GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) to bolster medical imaging capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo tap into the promising growth opportunities within the biotech sector, investors can consider ETFs that provide exposure to leading industry players such as Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). 10 Best Performing Biotech ETFs in 2024\n\nLikoper/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled our selection of the best performing biotech ETFs by ranking the top 10 based on their 5-year share price performance as of April 20, 2024, arranging them in ascending order for clarity. Additionally, we've provided insights into the top holdings of each ETF to enhance understanding for potential investors.\n\n10. SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 20: -5.06%\n\nThe SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) seeks to mirror the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, offering exposure to the biotech sector within the S&P Total Market Index. With assets under management totaling $6,251.28 million as of April 18, the ETF diversifies across large, mid, and small-cap biotech stocks, featuring a gross expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nExact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) holds a prominent position within the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI). Specializing in cancer screening and diagnostic tests, Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of -$0.27 and revenue of $647 million on February 21, surpassing Wall Street estimates by $0.21 and $7.3 million, respectively.\n\nInsider Monkey's fourth-quarter database reveals bullish sentiment from 39 hedge funds toward Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS), down from 45 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nArtisan Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top detractors were Lattice Semiconductor, Shockwave and Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS). Exact Sciences is a leading provider of diagnostic testing and maker of the noninvasive colorectal cancer screening test Cologuard®. The stock was a top performer through the first half of the year but pulled back in Q3. The company reported strong financial results as 31% growth in screening revenues (mostly Cologuard®) drove an overall 19% revenue increase. However, screening revenues fell slightly short of elevated expectations and were not good enough to support the stock’s year-to-date outperformance. We continue to be bullish on Cologuard’s® long-term growth potential; the addressable market expanded significantly in 2021 when the United States Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screenings to 45 from 50. Our research indicates the lowered screening age expands the company’s addressable market by ~18 million unscreened individuals. We also believe meaningful long[1]term opportunities exist as the company develops additional high-value cancer tests.”\n\nIn addition to Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) is a biotechnology stock that investors should look out for.\n\n9. First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (NYSE:FBT)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 20: 1.16%\n\nThe First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (NYSE:FBT) seeks to replicate the performance of the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index, which encompasses companies within two sub-industries: Biotech Therapeutics, focused on therapeutic treatments, and Biotech Tools & Diagnostics, centered on tools and processes supporting biotechnology practices. Established on June 19, 2006, the ETF holds a portfolio of 30 stocks and offers a gross expense ratio of 0.56%.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI) is the biggest holding of the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (NYSE:FBT). Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, clinically developing, and commercializing small molecule drugs primarily targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms in the central nervous system. On February 22, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of -$0.30, surpassing market consensus by $0.15. Although revenue increased by 50.2% year-over-year to $132 million, it fell short of Street estimates by $3.67 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds expressed bullish sentiments toward Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI), compared to 37 funds in the preceding quarter. Kurt Von Emster’s VenBio Select Advisor holds the largest stake in the company, with 2.25 million shares valued at $161.5 million.\n\n8. Tema Oncology ETF (NASDAQ:CANC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 20: 2.85%\n\nTema Oncology ETF (NASDAQ:CANC) is an actively managed fund designed for long-term growth by investing in oncology companies. Established on August 14 of the previous year, the ETF boasts a portfolio of 47 stocks and assets under management totaling nearly $17.13 million as of April 18, 2024. Its gross expense ratio stands at 0.99%.\n\nLeading the holdings of the Tema Oncology ETF (NASDAQ:CANC) is Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), a key player in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the development of medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, and animal health products. As of March 11, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald assigned a $135 price target and an Overweight rating to Merck & Co., Inc.

        "content": "While technology is not the only area of the stock market that’s currently growing, it continues to be a major force in equities trading. And while the mega-cap tech stocks tend to get all the media and investor attention, there are many lesser known names that are also posting significant increases in their share prices and outperforming the broader market. For investors, being aware of these less popular names can help deepen a portfolio.\n\nSome companies that investors may be unfamiliar with have seen their share prices more than double in the last year, many beating the performances of much larger and better known technology concerns. Being able to look beyond the usual suspects and find stocks that are quiet compounders can help grow an investment portfolio over time and make a big difference in long-term performance. Here are three tech stocks flying under the radar to buy in April 2024.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile much of the talk related to semiconductor stocks focuses on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), shares of microchip equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) have been quietly outperforming. AMAT stock has risen 36% in 2024 thus far, bringing its 12-month increase to 88%. The stock is among the top performers in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100indices. The growth has been fueled by strong demand for its products, which has translated into positive earnings for the company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApplied Materials makes the products and equipment needed to manufacture microchips and semiconductors. Its clients include Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As one might expect, business is booming with the AI revolution in full-swing. Applied Materials reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.12 for the fourth quarter of 2023, which beat analysts’ estimates of $1.90. Revenue came in at $6.71 billion, which beat forecasts of $6.48 billion.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) Front of a Western Digital (WDC) building in Malpitas, California.\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is another tech stock that has been flying under the radar despite outperforming the market in 2024. The company makes computer drives and specializes in data storage which, despite not being very exciting, is an essential component of the tech sector. This is why WDC stock has nearly doubled in the past 12 months, including a 39% increase this year. For shareholders, Western Digital Corp. has proven to be an unheralded gem of an investment.\n\nIn recent weeks, analysts across Wall Street have been raising their ratings and price targets on WDC stock. The bullish outlook is being driven by Western Digital’s plan to split its hard-disk drive and flash businesses into two independent publicly traded companies. Analysts also see upside from growing consumer and corporate demand for Western Digital’s products, which is being driven by the growth of AI applications. The corporate split is planned for the second half of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\neBay (EBAY) an ebay shipping box. cheap stocks\n\nSource: ShutterStockStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter years of underperformance, many investors had given up on e-commerce company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The stock seemed destined to become a value trap. However, after years of being stuck in neutral, EBAY stock has quietly undergone a revival in 2024. Since January, the share price has risen nearly 12% which is the company’s best start to a year in nearly a decade. The rebound is due to solid earnings and guidance from the company, as well as returning capital to long suffering shareholders.\n\nIn February, eBay announced that it’s raising its quarterly dividend payment by 8%. eBay now pays shareholders a quarterly dividend of 27 cents per share, up from the previous 25 cents. The increased payout to stockholders lifts the dividend yield on eBay’s stock to 2.14%, which is much better than what’s offered by most technology companies. eBay also announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program. While EBAY stock is up 15% this year, it has increased only 32% over the last five years due to poor past performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AMAT.

        "content": "If you’re looking for growth stocks with huge gains for your next investment, there’s really no need to mess around. You want to find the biggest and best names in the market that have a track record in recent quarters of providing extraordinary growth.\n\nWhile investors like Warren Buffett lean toward value stocks – a stock that is fundamentally cheap based on ratios like price-to-earnings or price-to-book, – growth stocks are more about the end result. Some of the names on this list have crazy fundamentals, but they that’s only because their returns are so strong. Growth stocks are those that are growing or expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market or the overall economy.\n\nThese companies are hyper-focused on expanding their businesses, reinvesting earnings into expanding operations or developing new products.  Growth stocks with huge gains can help investors build wealth over the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to identify the best candidates for growth in the market today. And here’s a spoiler alert – you’ve surely heard of many of the high-profile names on this list.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve written about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) a lot in the last few months, and I’m going to continue to beat the drum for this dynamic growth stock. Nvidia is one of the best names you can buy because of its unique position in the semiconductor industry and its key role in fueling the growth of generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nNvidia manufactures about 90% of the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used in generative AI. That’s led to the company soaring in valuation and market capitalization – Nvidia is now the third-most valuable company in the world, with a market cap above $2.1 trillion.\n\nNow Nvidia is going to be even better. It’s replacing the H100 processors currently in use with Blackwell processors that will be four times as powerful as H100 processors.\n\nOne thing to note – NVDA stock is actually down about 6% in the last month because some investors are worried that sales will temporarily falter if customers hold off on new purchases while they wait for the Blackwell processors to go on the market. And maybe that will happen. But I’m taking this brief break as a buying opportunity because I’m convinced that Nvidia has a lot more growth left in it.\n\nNVDA stock remains up 70% this year and more than 200% higher than a year ago. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an overall “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is Nvidia’s top competitor. Truthfully, AMD was left in the dust in 2023 as Nvidia sales skyrocketed. But now AMD is in a position to begin providing an alternative to Nvidia’s chips. And it has a definite advantage in the personal computer market as well.\n\nAMD is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue this year from its Mi300 GPU accelerator. AMD also provides AI-compatible central processing units (CPUs) for the PC market, where it still has a competitive advantage.\n\nAnalysts at Baird expect “comfortable upside” to AMD this year and reiterated its “outperform” rating while setting a $200 price target. That’s a healthy target, particularly since AMD is affected by Beijing’s recently announced plan to phase out the use of AMD chips from government PCs and servers. AMD gets about 15% of its revenue from mainland China, so the news impacted AMD stock.\n\nBut I’m still confident. AMD is too strong a growth play to ignore here. The stock is up 70% in the last year and gets a “B” grade for growth and an overall “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is another name that’s been on my radar screen in recent months. The company made its mark by using AI to provide real-time analysis and suggestions to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.\n\nBut in recent quarters, Palantir is growing the business on the commercial side – and that’s where the real growth will be. Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million. By contrast, Palantir’s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%.\n\nPalantir also has a software deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will make some of its products, including AI software, deployable on Oracle’s platform.\n\nTheStreet Pro analyst Bruce Kamich has a $48 price target on PLTR stock, which would be a 125% increase from today’s prices. I think it’s certainly achievable. PLTR stock is up 142% in the last 12 months and gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the companies that first brought generative AI into the public arena. It was a gamechanger when OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in late 2022, and Microsoft, with a 49% stake in the company, had a lot to do with that development. Microsoft already uses OpenAI in many of its products.\n\nBut Microsoft isn’t finished yet – not by a long shot. It’s building a new AI hub in London that is expected to  “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models.”\n\nAnd here’s something else to consider: Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says that generative AI is giving Microsoft an “iPhone moment.” Think about that for a moment. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changed the world when it unveiled the iPhone which was the first mass-marketed smartphone. And it changed the trajectory of Apple stock for decades.\n\nIf generative AI is truly Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” the Microsoft could be seeing a long period of sustained growth.\n\nMSFT stock is up 43% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another company that is using AI to its advantage. The company utilizes AI for voice recognition products, such as one geared toward vehicle owners that lets them access their owners’ manual and ask questions about vehicle features.\n\nEmployee Assist is another great SoundHound product that provides audio instructions to an employee who makes a verbal request about job functions.\n\nThe stock took off in a big way in mid-February when Nvidia disclosed an ownership position in the company. And even though the stock has pulled back in recent weeks to less than $5 per share, the partnership with Nvidia and SoundHound is too appealing for me to ignore.\n\nSoundHound is also planning to sell as much as $150 million in new shares – an announcement that contributed to the stock’s recent slide, but I see as a sign that the company is one of the most compelling growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nSOUN stock remains up 80% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most important companies in the world. It more than dominates the internet search market. In fact, it has a near monopoly, with a 95% market share for its Google search engine. That gives Alphabet an unmatched profit center for its advertising business.\n\nAnd remember, Alphabet is a lot more than just Google. The company operates YouTube, Waze, Nest, Fitbit and more.\n\nBut one place where Alphabet has not made waves is with AI – at least, until very recently. GOOG stock jumped higher this month on a flurry of AI developments that are long overdue for a company as revolutionary as Alphabet. It’s creating in-house designed data center CPUs, launching a new AI-powered text-to-video application, and its introducing AI-powered add-ons to its subscription-based software products.\n\nAlphabet will report quarterly earnings in late April. And even if there are short-term headwinds, I’m confident in GOOG stock as a long-term growth play.\n\nGOOG is up 48% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew companies have the reach as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger and WhatsApp counts 3.98 billion people as monthly active users.\n\nThat enormous audience makes Meta an extremely attractive advertising platform, which is why Meta is working on harnessing the power of AI and machine learning to optimize its advertising offerings. Meta also unveiled its latest in-house artificial intelligence accelerator chip.\n\nAnalysts are reiterating “buy” or equivalent to “buy” ratings on shares and raising their quarterly earnings forecasts for META stock, which will issue its next quarterly earnings report on April 24.\n\nIf Meta beats those expectations, it could be an extremely good day for shareholders, which makes it one of the best growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nMETA stock is up 129% in the last year and 41% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an “A” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR and MSFT.

Look at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After testing a high of $17.59, it pulled back to $16.33, where it caught support and is just starting to pivot higher. Plus, it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, which tells us it’s overdue to bounce. And while you wait for the AT&T stock to recover, you can collect its yield of 6.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven more top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold today.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) gapped from about $100 to a low of $88.80. However, it’s starting to pivot higher, and could soon refill that gap at around $100. Helping, Bank of America analysts just upgraded the NKE stock to a buy rating with a price target of $113. The firm argues NKE has a newer line up of footwear and apparel products. Plus, the upcoming Olympics should have a positive impact on the stock, too.\n\nJPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $164. The firm pointed to Nike’s improvement in China. In addition, Morgan Stanley says retailers are seeing improving sequential demand trends for athletic apparel.\n\nBetter, earnings negativity has been priced into the stock. Investors weren’t too enthused when the company said growth was near zero, or that management expected for revenue to pull back in the first half of fiscal 2025, which starts in June. But again, that appears to be priced in.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere’s also “The Monthly Dividend Company,” Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nWith a yield of 5.93%, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is also a buy on weakness. In fact, after slipping from $54.39 to $50.65, it’s now starting to pivot higher again. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its monthly dividend. Its latest one for 25.7 cents is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. This is the company’s 646th consecutive monthly dividend with many more on the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income has been around for more than 50 years now. It has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nSome of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few. It’s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) Fidelity sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund, such as the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF “focuses on companies we believe have above-average earnings growth potential with sustainable business models, for which the market has mispriced the rate and/or durability of growth,” as noted by Fidelity.\n\nTop holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to name a few.\n\nEven more impressive, since bottoming out at around $27 in late October, the ETF hit a high of about $39. It just recently pulled back with the broader market to $36.84. Now oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, that weakness is an opportunity. From its current price of $36.84, I’d like to see the ETF challenge $40 a share initially.\n\nWhat’s nice about an ETF like this one is we can diversify with top blue-chip stocks. All for less than $37 a share at the moment.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG) vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot blue-chip ETF to consider is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VIG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06%, the VIG ETF currently yields 1.76%. its last payout of 76.92 cents was paid on March 27. The next one should be out by June. It also holds 340 stocks, including Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). All in its effort to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $150, the VIG ETF ran to a high of $183.02. Since then, it has dipped to $173.63, where it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price, I’d like to see it initially retest $182.07 and head to $200 near term.\n\nWhat’s nice about this ETF is we can gain exposure to 340 of the world’s top stocks. All for less than $175 a share at the moment. Plus, we can collect its yield as it appreciates.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which we’re all familiar with.\n\nWith a yield of 2.56%, the consumer goods company is also a buy on recent weakness. After pulling back from about $160, it’s now technically oversold at $157.29. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R and is just starting to pivot higher. Initially, I’d like to see the PG stock retest its prior high and push to at least $170 near term.\n\nIt also just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.0065, a 7% jump from its prior dividend of 94.07 cents. It’s payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 19.\n\nHelping, Barclays just reiterated a buy rating on the PG stock with a price target of $168. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also raised their price target to $172 with a buy rating. The firm says “year-to-date consumption trends for Procter remain solid in tracked channels. The firm sees little risk to near-term earnings numbers given the company’s ongoing productivity momentum and relative cost favorability,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) An angled side view of a row of parked cars. automotive stock picks\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), it traded at $135 on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “Use the weakness as an opportunity. While we wait for the eventual recovery here, we can collect its 2.76% yield. We can profit from capital appreciation, and get paid to wait.” Just a few months later, GPC is now up to $160.23 and could see higher highs.\n\nNow yielding 2.5%, the stock rocketed 11.2% higher on Thursday after raising its fiscal year 2024 profit guidance. For the year, it expected to post EPS of $8.95 to $9.15. Now it expects to post EPS of $9.05 to $.9.20, which boosted investor confidence.\n\nEven better, its dividend – which has been increased consistently for 67 years – is safe. In the first three months of 2024, the company said it “used $175 million in cash for financing activities, including $133 million for quarterly dividends paid to shareholders and $38 million for stock repurchases. Free cash flow was $203 million.”\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks good on weakness, too.\n\nAfter dropping to $58.18 from $61, it’s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. But it is starting to bounce back fast. From its last traded price of $58.91, I’d like to see it retest $61. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its yield of about 3.3%. Its latest dividend of 48.5 cents was recently paid out on April 1. Annualized, it’s $1.94 and is the company’s 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nPlus, “The company returned $8 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2023, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to shareowners since Jan. 1, 2010, to $84.7 billion,” as noted in a recent press release. Helping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on KO to $68 with an overweight rating. All as the company continues to grow its revenue, as the global soft drink market continues to explode.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nFutures up: Dow 0.42%, S&P 0.48%, Nasdaq 0.56%\n\nApril 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures gained on Monday after slumping in the previous session as easing Middle East tensions buoyed risk sentiment, while investors looked ahead for an action-packed week with major tech earnings and a key inflation print.\n\nThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended lower on Friday as Netflix shares weighed after a dour quarterly earnings report, with both the indexes suffering six straight sessions of declines last week, their longest losing streak since October 2022.\n\nNvidia led gains across megacap growth stocks with a 2.4% rise in premarket trading, rebounding from a 10% drop in the last session.\n\nOther stocks such as Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Alphabet edged higher between 0.3% and 0.9%.\n\nTesla, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Microsoft will be in focus this week as the companies gear up to deliver their quarterly numbers, whose performance could further test the rally in U.S. stocks.\n\nThe risk-on mode was also supported by signs of easing tensions in the Middle East, as Iran's foreign minister said on Friday Tehran was investigating an overnight attack, adding that so far a link to Israel had not been proven as he downplayed the strike.\n\n\"Overnight, risk sentiment is better on relief rally that no adverse geopolitical headlines were reported on the weekend,\" Mohit Kumar, chief economist Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n\n\"Our cautious stance continues this week, though the repricing from last week, particularly in tech stocks would give an opportunity to buy the dip.\"\n\nEquities have sold-off recently as market participants readjust their interest rate cut expectations from the U.S. Federal Reserve after a string of strong economic data signaling persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nMoney markets are now pricing in just about 38 basis points (bps) of rate cuts this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the beginning of the year, according to LSEG data.\n\nOn the docket this week would be the price consumption expenditure (PCE) index reading for March -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to further ascertain the monetary policy trajectory.\n\nAt 5:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 161 points, or 0.42%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 24 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 95.75 points, or 0.56%.\n\nAmong single stocks, Tesla fell 2.7% before the bell as the electric vehicle maker cut prices in a number of its major markets, including China and Germany, following price reductions in the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce rose 3.4% after the business software maker backed away from its talks to acquire data-management software firm Informatica after the two companies could not agree on terms.\n\nInformatica's shares were down 6.3%.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nThe so-called 'Magnificent 7' of U.S. megacap tech stocks has retreated sharply as first-quarter earnings updates kick off this week, with AI-chip star Nvidia swooning 10% on Friday after a nervy week for the sector.\n\nWorld markets stabilised more broadly on Monday as another tense weekend in the Middle East passed without another direct exchange of missiles between the Israel and Iran - even though a cooling of situation had been well flagged already on Friday.\n\nStill, the post-weekend unwind of 'safety trades' has seen U.S. crude prices fall back to their lowest level this month and gold prices retreated 1%.\n\nBut with four of the Magnificent 7 due to report corporate updates this week - Tesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet - the alarming recoil in tech behemoths is now top of mind.\n\nThe 10% drop of artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia on Friday is perhaps the most eye-catching move of a pretty dour week for sector. Even though shares in the chip giant are still up more than 50% for the year to date, they have now dropped 22% from last month's peaks to their lowest since February.\n\nIt's not clear what triggered the rout, although some analysts pointed to a 23% drop in a smaller related stock Super Micro Computer over a lack of guidance on its upcoming earnings report as a factor.\n\nBut it had been a lousy week for tech and chip stocks before that. Although Nasdaq futures are back up about 0.5% ahead of Monday's bell, the index recorded its worst week last week since 2022 with a drop of more than 5%.\n\nA sharp recoil in Taiwan's TSMC after its earnings update earlier in the week started the ball rolling and then a near 10% dive in Netflix on Friday was another blow after the video streaming company's second-quarter revenue view fell short of analysts' expectations.\n\nThe once-dominant NYFANG index lost a whopping 8.3% last week. UBS analysts on Monday downgraded what they dub the 'Big 6 Tech+' stocks - basically the Magnificent 7 minus Tesla - to neutral from overweight.\n\nAnd elsewhere in the Magnificent 7, 2024 losses in Apple are now running at more than 14% - while Tesla's bruising slide of more than 40% this year shows no sign of abating.\n\nTesla's woes are legion - from a sharp fade in electric vehicle demand worldwide to a full-blown price war with Chinese competitors, corporate governance issues with boss Elon Musk's payout and numerous product glitches to boot.\n\nBut the 'higher-for-longer' view of Federal Reserve interest rates clearly doesn't help stretched valuations in the sector - where the earnings season so far shows there's an extremely high bar to wow the market gallery at this stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere in the macro world, U.S. Treasuries and the dollar continue to chomp at the bit on the unfolding stubborn Fed view, strong incoming economic numbers and the contrasting picture in Europe that means interest rates there look set to fall first.\n\nTwo-year U.S. Treasury yields probed above 5% again on Monday, with an auction of two-year paper due Tuesday.\n\nThe dollar continue to push higher to within a fraction of last week's highs against Japan's yen just under 155 per dollar, with the Bank of Japan meeting later this week.\n\nBut with the European Central Bank crystal clear about plans to cut its key policy rates as soon as June, the dollar remains pumped up against the euro too.\n\nAccording to the latest CFTC data, speculative long positions in dollar built further in the week ending April 16, hitting $28.51 billion - the biggest position since June 2019.\n\nThe big mover on Monday was sterling, which skidded to 5-month lows after a surprisingly dovish speech on Friday from Bank of England deputy governor David Ramsden flagged how the BoE expected inflation to fall to 2% this quarter and stay there for the next couple of years.\n\nWith U.S. stock futures higher, most other world bourses were firmer, too.\n\nHong Kong stocks climbed more than 1.5% even as mainland shares slipped, as investors found comfort in the China securities regulator's decision on Friday to promote the city's status as a global financial centre.\n\nChina will facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese companies and expand the Stock Connect cross-border investment scheme, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.\n\nChina left benchmark lending rates unchanged at a monthly fixing on Monday, in line with market expectations.\n\nEuropean bank earnings will be in the stock market spotlight there this week as BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all report.\n\nAmong the top stock movers on Monday, Galp Energia surged 17% after the Portuguese firm said that the Mopane field off Namibia could have at least 10 billion barrels of oil.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:\n\n* US corporate earnings: Verizon, Ameriprise Financial, Truist Financial, Globe Life, Nucor, Cadence Design, Alexandria Real Estate, Brown & Brown, Packaging Corp of America\n\n* Chicago Federal Reserve March business survey; Euro zone April consumer confidence survey\n\n* US Treasury sells 3-, 6-month bills\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n\nView comments",

UBS analysts on Monday downgraded what they dub the 'Big 6 Tech+' stocks - basically the Magnificent 7 minus Tesla - to neutral from overweight.\n\nAnd elsewhere in the Magnificent 7, 2024 losses in Apple are now running at more than 14% - while Tesla's bruising slide of more than 40% this year shows no sign of abating.\n\nTesla's woes are legion - from a sharp fade in electric vehicle demand worldwide to a full-blown price war with Chinese competitors, corporate governance issues with boss Elon Musk's payout and numerous product glitches to boot.\n\nBut the 'higher-for-longer' view of Federal Reserve interest rates clearly doesn't help stretched valuations in the sector - where the earnings season so far shows there's an extremely high bar to wow the market gallery at this stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere in the macro world, U.S. Treasuries and the dollar continue to chomp at the bit on the unfolding stubborn Fed view, strong incoming economic numbers and the contrasting picture in Europe that means interest rates there look set to fall first.\n\nTwo-year U.S. Treasury yields probed above 5% again on Monday, with an auction of two-year paper due Tuesday.\n\nThe dollar continue to push higher to within a fraction of last week's highs against Japan's yen just under 155 per dollar, with the Bank of Japan meeting later this week.\n\nBut with the European Central Bank crystal clear about plans to cut its key policy rates as soon as June, the dollar remains pumped up against the euro too.\n\nAccording to the latest CFTC data, speculative long positions in dollar built further in the week ending April 16, hitting $28.51 billion - the biggest position since June 2019.\n\nThe big mover on Monday was sterling, which skidded to 5-month lows after a surprisingly dovish speech on Friday from Bank of England deputy governor David Ramsden flagged how the BoE expected inflation to fall to 2% this quarter and stay there for the next couple of years.\n\nWith U.S. stock futures higher, most other world bourses were firmer, too.\n\nHong Kong stocks climbed more than 1.5% even as mainland shares slipped, as investors found comfort in the China securities regulator's decision on Friday to promote the city's status as a global financial centre.\n\nChina will facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese companies and expand the Stock Connect cross-border investment scheme, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.\n\nChina left benchmark lending rates unchanged at a monthly fixing on Monday, in line with market expectations.\n\nEuropean bank earnings will be in the stock market spotlight there this week as BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank , Barclays and Lloyds all report.\n\nAmong the top stock movers on Monday, Galp Energia surged 17% after the Portuguese firm said that the Mopane field off Namibia could have at least 10 billion barrels of oil. Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * US corporate earnings: Verizon, Ameriprise Financial, Truist Financial, Globe Life, Nucor, Cadence Design, Alexandria Real Estate, Brown & Brown, Packaging Corp of America * Chicago Federal Reserve March business survey; Euro zone April consumer confidence survey * US Treasury sells 3-, 6-month bills\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "It's Time to Ditch These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks and Replace Them With 2 Bona Fide Outperformers",
        "content": "Within the past couple of weeks, all three major stock indexes powered their way to fresh record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that are widely credited with lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to new heights.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, as the name implies, are seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. These seven components are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from crushing the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing-10-year period, the Magnificent Seven have undeniable competitive advantages. Examples include:\n\nNvidia controlling upwards of 90% of all graphics processing units deployed in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated enterprise data centers. Amazon being the leader in U.S. e-commerce retail market share and global cloud infrastructure service spend (via Amazon Web Services). Alphabet's Google accounting for an estimated 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, per GlobalStats.\n\nBut not all of the Magnificent Seven components are ultimately \"magnificent.\" To be brutally honest, some have been nothing short of operating duds over the past year. What follows are two Magnificent Seven stocks that should be sent to the chopping block, as well as the two phenomenal businesses that can logically replace them.\n\nIt's time to ditch this Magnificent Seven component: Tesla\n\nAs I stated plainly in late February, the Tesla growth story is officially dead. While the company has amassed a healthy cash pile to navigate a turbulent market for electric vehicles (EVs), and it's driven its first-mover advantages to four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, Tesla is a shell of what it was once advertised to be.\n\nTo begin with, the company has been aggressively reducing the sales price of Model's 3, S, X, and Y since the start of 2023. Between Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023, Tesla's operating margin was more-than-halved to 8.2%. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that EV demand dictates his company's pricing strategy. Yet even with aggressive price cuts, inventory levels have been stubbornly climbing.\n\nAnother issue with Tesla is that its efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many EV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has stalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-digits. Tesla's sales and profitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs -- and that's a segment that's under serious pressure right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've highlighted in the past, Tesla also generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources that include interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. This makes the company's premium valuation all the more egregious.\n\nTesla is an auto company losing its first-mover advantages that, in my view, has no business being viewed as a Magnificent Seven component. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt's also time to put this Magnificent Seven constituent out to pasture: Apple\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven stock that should be given the proverbial heave-ho is tech titan Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple's iPhone still dominates in the U.S., and the company's subscription-powered Services segment has been its most-consistent performer for years. Further, the $651 billion in share repurchases Apple has undertaken since the start of 2013 is tops among all public companies. A steady diet of buybacks has provided a boost to Apple's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe concern with Apple is that its growth engine has completely stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended in late September), sales declined in all of Apple's physical product segments. Through the first three months of fiscal 2024, iPad and Wearables generated double-digit percentage sales declines from the prior-year period.\n\nTo make matters worse, preliminary research data released from IDC last week shows that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by 9.6% to 50.1 million units from the previous year. iPhone is the company's top revenue driver.\n\nWhen Apple was valued at 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings, no one batted an eye if the company endured a growth hiccup. But at 27 times forecast EPS for the current fiscal year, a second consecutive year of zero or negative growth is too much of an eyesore to sweep under the rug.\n\nApple's best growth days may well be in the rearview mirror -- and for that reason, it no longer belongs in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe first outperformer that deserves its spot among the Magnificent Seven: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIf Tesla and Apple are shown the door, the first no-brainer company that should be viewed as a true Magnificent Seven component is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nWhile it's true that Berkshire isn't an innovator in the same capacity as either Tesla or Apple, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team have led Berkshire to virtually unmatched annualized returns dating back more than a half-century. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500.\n\nThree catalysts continue to make Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders richer over time. First off, Buffett and his team have a lengthy track record of generating big-time returns in the stock market. Berkshire's $361 billion investment portfolio contains 45 stocks and two index funds, with a heavy concentration in just four stocks (one of which happens to be Apple).\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly five dozen businesses, which have helped grow its operating revenue and income. Some of Berkshire's fully owned subsidiaries include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF. A portfolio weighted heavily to cyclical businesses gets to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe third reason Berkshire's stock keeps climbing is because Warren Buffett has given the green light to more than $74 billion worth of share buybacks since July 2018. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire's EPS and making its stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused long-term investors.\n\nA second outperformer that's proven it's magnificent: Visa\n\nThe other outstanding company that makes for a logical replacement for Tesla or Apple in the Magnificent Seven is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, you could certainly argue that Tesla and Apple are more innovative than Visa. But few companies have delivered for their shareholders on a more consistent basis than Visa has since its initial public offering in March 2008.\n\nIn the U.S., no payment processor accounts for a higher share of credit card network purchase volume than Visa. It was also the only payment facilitator in the U.S. that gained substantial share following the Great Recession. Since economic expansions last substantially longer than recessions, Visa benefits from the disproportionate long-term growth in spending from consumers and businesses.\n\nIt also has a lengthy growth runway beyond domestic borders. Emerging market regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia remain underbanked. Visa has the ability to organically expand its infrastructure into these markets, as well as quickly reach new regions by making acquisitions, just as it did in 2016 when it acquired Visa Europe.\n\nBest of all, Visa's management team has steered clear of becoming a lender. This strategic move ensures that it won't have to set aside capital during inevitable recessions to deal with credit delinquencies and loan losses. This is a competitive edge that's helped Visa maintain a juicy profit margin north of 50%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Can't Stop Buying the 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Billionaires Have Been Eager to Sell",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, more than a dozen next-big-thing investment trends and innovations have vied for Wall Street's attention. However, none of these innovations have inspired investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm talking about the broad definition of utilizing software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. What makes AI such a potential game-changer for corporate America is machine learning, which allows these systems to evolve over time, without human intervention, to become more effective at their assigned tasks, and/or learn new tasks.\n\nIt's very easy to be inspired by AI from an investment standpoint when analysts are casually tossing out the \"t\" word (trillions) to describe its potential. According to a 2023 report from PwC, artificial intelligence can provide a $15.7 trillion lift to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nSeemingly every investor wants exposure to the rise of AI -- and this includes members of Congress. Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders meeting with then-President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nNancy Pelosi is piling into the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement\n\nThanks to the STOCK Act, which was passed in 2012, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are required to report their trades of $1,000 or more no later than 45 days after they're completed. These periodic trading reports show that Democrats, on average, outperformed their Republican colleagues in the return column last year (31.18% vs. 17.99%).\n\nThe key to this outperformance was technology stocks, which were disproportionately owned by Democrats in the House and Senate.\n\nHowever, Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has proven that she's no ordinary Democrat when it comes to beating the benchmark S&P 500. Whereas the S&P 500 gained more than 24% last year, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales estimates that Nancy Pelosi's portfolio increased by more than 65%. Beating the broader market has become something of the norm for Pelosi.\n\nAlthough the former House Speaker and her venture capitalist husband Paul Pelosi have primarily invested in industry-leading, megacap businesses, it's multiple timely investments in the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, semiconductor behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which have fueled this outperformance.\n\nWhile there's been some modest profit-taking along the way, Pelosi's periodic transaction reports, via Capitol Trades, shows:\n\nA call option purchase of $250,000 to $500,000 of Nvidia stock on July 23, 2021. A common stock purchase of $500,000 to $1 million of Nvidia stock on July 23, 2021. A common stock purchase of $1 million to $5 million of Nvidia stock on July 26, 2022. The purchase of $1 million to $5 million of Nvidia $120 strike call options on Nov. 22, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most recent options trade has been particularly fruitful for Pelosi, with the value of these contracts increasing by almost $2 million in less than five months.\n\nNvidia's growth trajectory is unlike anything we've ever witnessed from a megacap company\n\nNvidia's ascension from a $360 billion company at the start of 2023 to the third-largest publicly traded company, with a market cap of almost $2.2 trillion, as of April 16, is the result of its graphics processing units (GPUs) taking the world by storm.\n\nThough estimates vary, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for approximately 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Nvidia's infrastructure is the \"brains\" that are helping to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions.\n\nOn top of its monopoly like market share in high-compute data centers, Nvidia has attracted orders from virtually all of the most-influential tech companies on Wall Street. \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for around 40% of its net sales. Meta alone is spending in the neighborhood of $10 billion to order 350,000 H100 GPUs for its data centers.\n\nSoaring demand has been especially beneficial to Nvidia's pricing power. The law of supply and demand states that if the supply of an in-demand good or service is limited, the price for that good or service will rise until demand tapers. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), Nvidia's data center sales climbed 217%, all while its cost of revenue rose (across all segments) by a more modest 43%. This makes it clear that the bulk of Nvidia's data center sales growth came from its otherworldly pricing power.\n\nAfter recording roughly $27 billion in full-year sales in fiscal 2023, Nvidia more than doubled its revenue to almost $61 billion last year. If Wall Street's consensus estimates are anywhere in the ballpark, Nvidia is expected to deliver $110 billion in sales this year and close to $138 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nWe've simply never witnessed a company as large as Nvidia sustain this level of growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has eight prominent billionaire investors running for the exit\n\nWhile it's clear the former House Speaker and her husband like what they see from Nvidia, more than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors can't sell shares of the company fast enough. Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter show that eight highly successful billionaires sold shares, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne probable reason for these eight billionaires to go against the grain is history. Every next-big-thing investment trend for three decades, including the internet, has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Regardless of the innovation, investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption and uptake of new technologies. If history rhymes, once again, the AI bubble is going to burst. No company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia. Thus, it may have the most to lose if the bubble pops.\n\nA strong argument can also be made that Nvidia is its own worst enemy. Nvidia increasing production of its AI-GPUs, coupled with the entrance of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel with high-powered GPUs of their own, could quickly reduce the scarcity that drove AI-GPU prices into the stratosphere. In short, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin should decline.\n\nPerhaps the biggest worry for Nvidia, and the reason eight billionaires reduced their fund's respective stakes during the fourth quarter, is that the company's top-four customers are all developing in-house GPUs for their data centers. This internal innovation is almost certain to result in reduced future orders from Nvidia.\n\nDespite Nancy Pelosi's phenomenal track record of outpacing the S&P 500, both the actions of these eight billionaires, along with historic precedence, suggest Nvidia stock may be in a bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could TSMC Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is often considered the top chipmaking play on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. It produces the high-end GPUs that are used to process complex AI tasks at data centers, and sales of those chips are skyrocketing as companies scramble to upgrade their AI capabilities.\n\nThat's why Nvidia's stock has soared 1,720% over the past five years. Nvidia could still have room to run as the AI market expands, but many investors are likely wondering whether other AI-related chip stocks can replicate Nvidia's jaw-dropping gains. Image source: TSMC.\n\nCould that stock be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker and manufacturer of Nvidia's top-tier GPUs? Let's review its business model, exposure to the AI market, and long-term growth potential to find out.\n\nMeet the world's most important chipmaker\n\nTSMC is the world's largest and most advanced third-party chip foundry. It produces the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips for fabless chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple. The company manufactures roughly 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which makes it the top bellwether and linchpin of the global semiconductor market.\n\nTSMC's closest competitors are Samsung and Intel, but it still produces more advanced chips than either competing chip foundry. TSMC gained that lead in the process race by adopting ASML's (NASDAQ: ASML) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers -- before its two main rivals.\n\nHow fast is TSMC growing?\n\nTSMC's growth ebbs and flows with the cyclical semiconductor market. It experienced two cyclical downturns over the past five years -- in 2019 and 2023 -- but its market dominance and pricing power still enabled the company to expand its gross margin.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 3.7% 25.2% 18.5% 42.6% (4.5%) Gross margin 46% 53.1% 51.6% 59.6% 54.4% EPS growth (1.7%) 50% 15.2% 70.4% (17.5%)\n\nData source: TSMC. Taiwanese dollar terms.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, TSMC generated 46% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes CPUs and GPUs for customers like Nvidia and AMD, and another 38% of its revenue from the smartphone market. In the HPC segment, the growth in the AI market has been offsetting sluggishness in the PC space over the past year. Unfortunately, its smartphone market is still stuck in a rut as the 5G upgrade cycle fizzles out.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, TSMC expects low to mid-20% revenue growth as the AI market expands, the PC arena stabilizes, and the smartphone market grows again in a stronger macro environment. Analysts expect both revenue and earnings to rise about 21% for the full year. Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 22 times forward earnings.\n\nBut during TSMC's first-quarter conference call, CEO C.C. Wei reduced the company's growth forecast for the broader semiconductor market (excluding memory chips) from more than 10% in 2024 to \"approximately 10%.\" Wei also reined in TSMC's full-year outlook for the foundry market from approximately 20% to mid-to-high teens expansion.\n\nThose reductions, which Wei blamed on ongoing \"macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,\" suggest another mixed year for semiconductor stocks. AI chipmakers like Nvidia would likely continue to flourish, but smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm would probably stay in the penalty box for a few more quarters.\n\nCould TSMC become the next Nvidia?\n\nTSMC's stock has nearly tripled over the past five years, but it probably won't keep pace with Nvidia's near-term gains for two simple reasons.\n\nFirst, TSMC's business is more broadly diversified than Nvidia's. The latter's incoming orders will certainly boost TSMC's HPC revenue, but a lot of that growth will still be offset by the softness of its PC and smartphone markets. Nvidia's simpler business model will also make it the more straightforward growth play as long as the AI market keeps expanding.\n\nSecond, TSMC simply isn't expanding rapidly enough to justify a significantly higher multiple. By comparison, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to surge another 81% and 89%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next January), but it still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings. Therefore, TSMC's stock could climb a lot higher over the next few years, but it probably won't match Nvidia's growth trajectory.\n\nTSMC and Nvidia are both great long-term plays on the semiconductor market, but it's ultimately an apples-to-oranges comparison. TSMC might be the better choice for conservative investors who are looking for balanced exposure to the chip sector, while Nvidia might be more appealing to growth investors who expect it to stay on top of the AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Time to step back from your Nvidia (NVDA) obsession for just a moment.\n\nAI is changing the data center landscape and unearthing an entirely new avenue of infrastructure demands — a hidden investment opportunity that’s currently under-appreciated by Mr. Market, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe under-the-radar play: Power generation producers.\n\n“The opportunity is around infrastructure… everything from power generation, power electronics, data centers — that growth rate is set to accelerate,” Morgan Stanley’s Stephen Byrd told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).\n\nGenerative AI processing, which is typically done on graphics processing units (GPU), requires way more power given higher computational requirements. That need for more power is fueling rapid growth of data centers across the country, which are pressuring the nation’s already strained power grid.\n\n“Data centers not only facilitate AI, but they're the backbone for our industries, for our commerce, for our transportation, for our health. These are mission-critical infrastructure. So it's going to be important that while we're facilitating this new industry, it's not lights out for the existing industries,” ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global electricity consumption from data centers could jump from 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh in 2026, roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.\n\nThat's a potential boon for power generation producers like Bloom Energy (BE), according to Byrd. He told Yahoo Finance the fuel cell company is among a group of firms “well positioned to serve the rapidly growing power needs of the GenAI enablers.”\n\n“The stock has not done well, and yet that's the type of technology that can allow data center developers to very quickly get new centers operational,” Byrd said. “The time it takes to get powered up is absolutely critical, and it's incredibly valuable economically ... Bloom Energy's fuel cells can be deployed in 50 days.”\n\nDuring Bloom Energy’s earnings call last quarter, CEO KR Sridhar told analysts he sees AI data centers as the company’s “single biggest segment” for growth in the next decade.\n\n“The sales funnel for this sector alone is massive, not in the megawatts but in the gigawatts,” Sridhar said.\n\nBeyond the maker of fuel-cell electricity generators, other independent power producers, including nuclear plant owners, are also poised to grow from the data center buildout ahead.\n\nBank of America research analyst Paul Cole sees Constellation Energy (CEG), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), Vistra (VST), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Dominion Energy (D) among the “clear beneficiaries'' of the increase in power demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile AI’s energy use has soared in the past year, Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance the industry is still only scratching the surface when it comes to power consumption.\n\n“GenAI growth, in terms of electricity growth, is going to be about 100% a year for many years to come. As the cost of compute drops, new use cases show up, so the demand for compute is only going to go up and up. We're extremely early days in this dynamic, and now investors are starting to look across what I think of as the value chain to providing the power to these data centers,\" Cole added.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 hot growth stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more growth stocks that are active in the market, go directly to the 5Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nAs 2024 moves forward, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets undergoes regular fluctuations, influenced by various factors such as economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and changes in interest rate forecasts. As an example, the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023 amid resurgent inflation, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. This uptick in borrowing costs has contributed to alleviating inflationary pressures, with recent data showing consumer prices increasing by only 3.1% from January 2023, marking a decline from the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and edging closer to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nSurprisingly, progress against inflation has been notable without inflicting significant economic hardship, with unemployment remaining below 4% for 24 consecutive months. Moreover, employers have consistently added an average of 244,000 jobs per month over the past year, with December and January seeing over 300,000 new jobs each. This combination of subdued inflation and GDP growth has fostered optimism that perhaps the Fed can achieve a rare \"soft landing.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the current year has an array of growth opportunities spanning different sectors within the capital markets. Leading the forefront is the technology sector, with artificial intelligence (AI) spearheading innovation. Its swift advancements and widespread integration across various industries render it an appealing option for investors pursuing growth and transformative prospects. As an illustration to this point, venture capital investments in generative AI and AI-related startups surged to nearly $50 billion the past year alone, with notable startups such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection commanding substantial portions of these investments.\n\nFollowing suit is the healthcare sector, securing the second spot, as it progresses alongside developments in medical technologies and a growing emphasis on personalized medicine. The increasing demand for GLP-1, a medication class utilized in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D), is a key factor driving this trend. According to research by J.P. Morgan, the GLP-1 category is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with growth attributed equally to its use in treating both diabetes and obesity.\n\nWhen it comes to stock selection for substantial returns in such times, focusing on growth stocks is a popular strategy. Growth stocks are characterized by higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, reflecting expectations of significant future growth. One metric commonly used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). This ratio compares the current share price to the earnings per share, indicating the premium that the market is willing to pay for a stock's earnings potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the notable companies included in our list of hot growth stocks to buy are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as industry giants like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), among others listed below. 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA close-up of a stock market ticker displaying the company's stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this piece, we utilized stock screeners to identify stocks meeting specific criteria as of March 28.

(NYSE:PLTR) witnessed a 19% surge in its stock. Revenue increased by 20% to $608 million, driven by robust demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) among commercial customers, although growth in the government segment remained subdued. Additionally, GAAP net income tripled to $93 million as Palantir focused on cost control measures.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's analysis of 933 hedge fund portfolios for the December quarter of 2023, 44 had stakes in Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR). D. E. Shaw emerged as the largest investor, owning 20.75 million shares valued at $356.39 million.\n\nMuch like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

We got a chance to initiate a position in Shopify during the 2022 growth stock selloff, with the view that this is a leading e-commerce franchise that will continue to benefit from key secular tailwinds. Like many market participants, we were concerned about the company’s capital-intensive fulfillment investments in the face of a slowing e-commerce market and welcomed the news that it decided to exit the logistics business in favor of a capital-light partnership model. This change in strategy significantly narrows the downside range of outcomes, and allows us to focus on what it does so well: develop great e-commerce software solutions for brands of all sizes. We have been encouraged by Shopify’s subsequent pace of innovative new product enhancements, which include the use of AI assistants to help brands run their businesses.”\n\n8.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks I’d Buy Over Nvidia Any Day of the Week",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the AI stock that has stayed hot over the past year, with its latest parabolic run taking it just shy of $1,000 per share. Undoubtedly, there’s plenty to look forward to as the newest AI chips come out of the pipeline to feed unprecedented demand. As the ultimate “pick and shovel” way to play the AI boom, one that’s probably far from over, it certainly makes sense to add to a position on any dips between now and year’s end.\n\nRecently, Nvidia stock has been finally showing signs of rolling over, dipping by nearly 20% from its $950 and change all-time high. Though nothing fundamental has changed in the past few weeks that caused Nvidia stock to slip, I think investors are becoming a tad more value-conscious and perhaps more skeptical of scorching momentum.\n\nWhile the recent NVDA stock correction may prove a wise long-term buying opportunity, the fact remains that an 20% pullback is a tiny blip in the one-year chart! And with a lofty 64x trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, there may be a better entry point for patient investors. Here are three AI stocks I’d rather own over Nvidia as the AI trade rolls over some potholes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) sees itself as a serious contender in the AI race, even if most analysts and investors aren’t buying it. The stock has been on a painful downward spiral in recent months, nosediving more than 31% off its 52-week high of just shy of $51 per share.\n\nUndoubtedly, the old-time semiconductor firm seems to be sparing no expense when it comes to building out new foundries and developing next-generation AI chips.\n\nUndoubtedly, there is some concern over the price tag of some of the company’s aggressive foundry development plans. It’s costing more than expected and is adding to the firm’s recent losses. And with recent delays in its Ohio-based foundry, investors are starting to get a bit impatient with the long-time laggard.\n\nThere’s been no shortage of disappointment when it comes to Intel lately. However, the stock offers a pretty enticing price of admission to investors who view the firm’s AI accelerators as having a puncher’s chance against the competition.\n\nIntel’s much-anticipated and more power-efficient Gaudi 3 AI chip was unveiled a few weeks ago, and once it hits the market, it may begin to nibble at the heels of Nvidia’s H100. I think too many are underestimating Gaudi’s potential.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is more than just Nvidia’s younger cousin; it’s a company that wants a better position in the AI race. And it may very well have its way as it continues investing heavily in its latest GPUs. Though I still like Nvidia for the long term, I’m more enthused by the entry point of AMD stock after enduring more punishment since its early-March peak. The stock is down just shy of 27% from its peak, a nice entry point, so say some analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee hiked its rating on AMD stock to Buy from Hold, citing the potential for the next generation of AI chips to compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell line. Specifically, Lee highlights MI350, MI375, and MI400 as the chips to watch going into the second half of 2024.\n\nLee is right. AMD is no slouch when it comes to AI chips. And while we’re all hyped about Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, I do think many investors are sleeping on AMD’s comparables.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nFinally, we have a software AI play in Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), which is fresh off a devastating, likely overdone, crash that came after a rough quarterly guide and a sudden CEO change.\n\nThe stock is now down more than 37% from its February 2024 peak. With the market cap back below $50 billion, numerous unanswered questions have investors and analysts rushing to the sidelines, most notably how Snowflake’s new CEO will steer the company in the age of AI.\n\nAmid the snowslide, though, some analysts, including Rosenblatt Securities, are turning bullish. Rosenblatt sees slower sales growth but sees the ecosystem as healthy. Indeed, I agree with the bullish turn after the nasty sell-off, which hopefully is nearing its end.\n\nMoving ahead, I expect new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy will have a lot to prove to the world as Snowflake as he focuses heavily on AI innovation, which is likely required to re-accelerate growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "Most of the so-called Big Techs -- the largest publicly traded technology companies --- have split their common stock in recent years. In 2022, e-commerce titan Amazon and Google parent Alphabet each had stock splits. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the leading producer of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, split its stock in 2021, and iPhone maker Apple did so the year before.\n\nThe stock of one of these companies -- Nvidia -- has run up tremendously recently. It has soared largely due to powerful demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the training of AI models and running of AI applications in data centers. Nvidia stock entered 2023 at $146.07 per share, and on April 19, 2024, it closed at $762.00. That's a hefty gain of 422% in 16 months.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's lofty stock price suggests the company could split its stock again soon.\n\nNvidia stock-split history\n\nNvidia held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999. The stock's IPO price was $12 per share. Since then, Nvidia stock has split five times. The IPO price adjusted for stock splits is $0.25.\n\nDate Stock-Split Type Share Price Prior to Stock-Split Announcement July 20, 2021 4-for-1 $583.36 (May 20, 2021) Sep 11, 2007 3-for-2 N/A Apr 07, 2006 2-for-1 N/A Sep 12, 2001 2-for-1 N/A Jun 27, 2000 2-for-1 N/A\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo Finance. N/A= not explored in this article.\n\nIn 2021, Nvidia stock was priced at $583.36 on the day prior to the company announcing its intention to split its stock. That's nearly $180 less than its current stock price, which provides strong support for the theory the company could split its stock in 2024.\n\nHere's a summary of the key events involved in Nvidia's last stock split:\n\nMay 21, 2021 -- The company announced its board of directors declared a 4-for-1 split of its common stock. As is standard practice, the split was contingent upon being approved by stockholders at the company's annual meeting. Nvidia shares gained 6% in the week following this announcement. June 3 -- Shareholders voted to approve the split. July 19 -- Shareholders of record on June 21 received three additional shares of stock for every one share they held on the record date. July 20 -- Nvidia stock began trading at its split-adjusted price.\n\nNvidia hasn't yet announced the date of its 2024 annual meeting, but it should be sometime in June. In 2023, it was on June 22.\n\nIf Nvidia intends to split its stock this year, investors can expect it to release a statement a couple of weeks in advance of its 2024 annual meeting. This would likely be in the late May to early June time frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill an Nvidia stock split matter?\n\nA Nvidia stock split won't change the underlying value of the company, nor will it alter an investor's proportionate stake in Nvidia.\n\nBut stock splits can result in several benefits for investors. The first one has to do with accessibility, as a split should increase the size of the pool of individual investors who might buy the stock. An investor would now need to plunk down $762 to buy a single share of Nvidia. Some folks might only have $250 or $500 to invest. Others might be able to afford to buy one share, but don't want to invest that much money in Nvidia, at least at one time.\n\nThere are some online brokerages that permit investors to buy (and sell) a fraction of one share. But not all of them do. And my guess is that most investors prefer owning a whole number of shares.\n\nExisting investors might also benefit from an Nvidia stock split. Soon after a company announces it intends to split its stock, the stock will often rise. This is due to investors' expectation that there will be greater demand for the stock when its accessibility increases. These post-announcement stock bumps, however, are not always sustained.\n\nLastly, an Nvidia stock split would give the company a much better chance at being included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the oldest U.S. stock index. This 30-large stock index is price-weighted, which means that extremely high-priced stocks have little chance of being included because they would have too much effect on the index price. A Dow index membership would mean that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to track the Dow would have to buy shares of Nvidia. This increased demand would exert upward pressure on the stock price.\n\nSplit or not, Nvidia stock is a great way to invest in the AI boom\n\nIn short, a stock split has the potential to be a slight positive for Nvidia stock. Stock split or not, Nvidia stock remains a great way to invest in the AI boom. That said, investors who are concerned about Nvidia's valuation being too high could buy a portfolio of chip stocks by buying an ETF. The two best-performing semiconductor ETFs over the short and longer terms are VanEck Semiconductor ETF and iShares Semiconductor ETF.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Down but Far From Out: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Is artificial intelligence (AI) all hype? After a lackluster few weeks for AI stocks, some investors are asking that question -- and getting nervous.\n\nThis week, three Motley Fool contributors examine Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to explain why they think these stocks are down from recent highs -- but are far from out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir stock is getting a much-needed breather\n\nJustin Pope (Palantir Technologies): Investors heard the buzz around AI a lot over the past year, and there are signs that Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is worthy of the buzz.\n\nThe signs are showing up in government, where Palantir continues winning contracts. It recently was awarded a $9.8 million contract from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and a $178 million contract from the Army.\n\nThey also show up in the private sector, where Palantir's customer growth is accelerating. Its U.S. commercial customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter, and 22% quarter over quarter. That's up from 37% year over year growth in the third quarter.\n\nAnd there are positive signs in the corporate space, where Palantir just announced a partnership with Oracle to distribute Palantir's AI technology on its cloud platform.\n\nYou can feel pretty good about the platform's quality and impact when it's in demand by so many different parties. There is still so much long-term room for growth, too. Palantir still has only about 500 customers, a tiny slice of the broader enterprise market.\n\nTechnology stocks have fallen recently due to the market's realization that interest rates could remain higher for longer than anticipated. That has cooled off Palantir stock from the high $20s to the low $20s, a breather that investors should welcome as a buying opportunity.\n\nAnalysts believe the company's earnings will have a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the next three to five years, a small sample of what could be decades of double-digit growth.\n\nThis data cloud stock is unlikely to stay frozen out for long\n\nWill Healy(Snowflake): Snowflake emerged as an increasingly essential data cloud platform. Data clouds allow enterprises to store, secure, and manage data from one central location.\n\nSnowflake has a competitive advantage because it can work with different cloud providers. This has prompted competitors like Amazon to sometimes market it over their own data cloud products.\n\nSuch an approach brought Snowflake more than 9,400 customers as of the end of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), 22% more than the previous fiscal year. Of those, 461 spent over $1 million yearly on the platform, a cohort that grew 39% over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, it earns revenue based on usage. This allows it to gain increasing amounts of revenue from current customers. This business model likely helped attract interest before its initial public offering (IPO) from Warren Buffett's team at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nHowever, the stock fell in recent weeks. A 22% revenue growth forecast in fiscal 2025, lower than in previous years, probably did not help, but the most impactful reason was probably the sudden retirement of CEO Frank Slootman, who led the company through its IPO in 2020 and in the years since.\n\nMoreover, the new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, came to Snowflake only last year via the Neeva acquisition, a search company Ramaswamy founded. This might make the direction of the company more uncertain.\n\nNonetheless, the lower revenue forecast and Ramaswamy's technology background might set him up to exceed expectations later. Also, investors should remember that the company is still growing rapidly. Its $2.8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024 rose 36% over the last year.\n\nFurthermore, adjusted free cash flow came in at $810 million for fiscal 2024. That is 56% higher than the previous year and reduces the negative impact of an $836 million net loss mostly brought about by rising stock-based compensation costs, a non-cash expense.\n\nLastly, the dramatic drop in the stock price has taken the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 18, the lowest level in the stock's history. Such levels are more likely to prompt buying in Snowflake stock as more companies seek an inter-operable data cloud product.\n\nNvidia is still firing on all cylinders\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): Undoubtedly, Nvidia led the charge as AI stocks soared. Over the last 18 months, its shares are up over 436%, meaning a $10,000 investment in November 2022 would be worth $53,600 today.\n\nYet the last month has been a different story. Shares are stuck in neutral, and it has investors asking whether the Nvidia bull is asleep -- or altogether dead.\n\nI think there's plenty of life left in the bull. First, the AI revolution is still in the early stages. Just this past week, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing raised forward guidance based on \"insatiable demand\" for AI chips. That's not the sort of comment that implies demand is slowing, and it's more proof that organizations are continuing to scale up their AI spending.\n\nAnd second, Nvidia's new AI chips are coming. In March, the company announced a new generation of AI chips, known as Blackwell or GB200. These chips are an upgrade to the Hopper generation of AI chips, which are already some of the most sought-after on the market. The first Blackwell chips won't ship until later in the year, but when they do, they should deliver a further boost to Nvidia's already impressive sales figures.\n\nIn short, overall demand for Nvidia's AI products and chips remains high. At the same time, the company is rolling out a new and improved GB200, which should help drive revenue and profits even higher. So long-term investors should stay the course -- the future still looks bright.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With Massive Potential That Billionaire Investors Love",
        "content": "It probably won't surprise you to learn that some of the Magnificent Seven stocks are among the most common holdings among billionaire hedge fund managers. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are extremely common holdings, as are several of the other mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nHowever, it can be more interesting to see what tech stocks billionaires think could be the next big things. Here are three tech stocks, owned by some of the most prominent hedge funds in the United States, that could have massive growth potential in the years ahead.\n\nA metaverse play with massive potential\n\nRoblox(NYSE: RBLX) is a major holding of Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund, which owns nearly $400 million of stock in the gaming platform provider. And while the progress of the metaverse gaming platform has certainly been impressive, it could still be in the earlier stages of growth.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Roblox had 71.5 million daily active users (DAUs) on its platform, 22% more than a year earlier. Management believes it could scale this to 1 billion DAUs over time, especially as wearable technology evolves and Roblox builds its presence in high-population international markets. The global metaverse market is expected to grow from $90 billion in 2023 to nearly $1 billion by 2030, and Roblox could be one of the biggest winners.\n\nRoblox is doing a great job of improving the efficiency of its business and expects to achieve positive free cash flow in 2024, and to expand margins by 100-300 basis points per year through at least 2027. Plus, management is doing a great job of finding new ways to monetize the platform, such as immersive advertising.\n\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the tech sector\n\nRenaissance Technology – the hedge find led by Jim Simons – has a $450 million stake in cybersecurity platform CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). And while AI has been the center of attention so far in 2024, cybersecurity remains a massive and long-tailed opportunity.\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in cloud-based cybersecurity and was an early AI leader, using the technology to develop the best threat-detection capabilities on the market. And as the company grows, its capabilities get even stronger. After all, the company uses crowdsourced data (hence the name) to learn about and find security issues.\n\nCrowdStrike generates over $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue today, but this could be just a starting point. Management sees a $100 billion addressable market opportunity for the business, but with the rapid growth and evolution of the cybersecurity industry, it believes that within the next few years, the market will grow to $225 billion in size and that CrowdStrike can achieve $10 billion in ARR by the end of this decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nA high-potential social media platform\n\nSocial media platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is the largest technology stock owned by Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and by a wide margin.\n\nPinterest's business has been performing quite well recently, rebounding nicely from a growth slowdown after the pandemic-era surge subsided. The user base reached 498 million at the end of 2023, 11% more than a year prior, and the company was far more profitable with 86% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere are several promising growth avenues. CEO Bill Ready is relatively new in the role and has made some exciting moves to boost Pinterest's e-commerce potential. And it's also worth noting that while Pinterest makes the bulk of its money from North American users, international users actually make up about 80% of the total and have tons of monetization potential in the years ahead.\n\nThree high-potential businesses\n\nTo be sure, I'd never suggest investing in a particular stock just because a certain billionaire or hedge fund does. But these are three excellent businesses that have large addressable market opportunities, excellent leadership, and strong momentum, and they could be worth a closer look for your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roblox right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roblox, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roblox wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Democrats Crushed Republicans in Average Stock Market Returns in 2023: Here's Their Not-So-Subtle Secret to Success.",
        "content": "The two major political parties are nearly at parity in the U.S. Congress. In the House of Representatives, Republicans narrowly outnumber Democrats 218 to 213 with four vacant seats resulting from recent resignations. In the Senate, Republicans have 49 seats compared to Democrats' 48 seats. However, three independents caucus with Democrats, giving the party a slim majority.\n\nThere's one area, though, where the two major parties aren't close at all. Democrats crushed Republicans in average stock market returns in 2023.\n\nLopsided returns\n\nLast year was a good one for most investors. A new bull market that officially began in October 2022 picked up steam. The S&P 500 jumped over 24%.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress handily beat that level. Their average return was nearly 31.2%. Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.), who resigned from his seat in February 2024, was the biggest winner among congressional stock traders in 2023 with a jaw-dropping gain of 238.9%.\n\nHowever, the GOP representatives and senators didn't fare nearly as well. The average 2023 return for Republican members of Congress was a hair under 18%. In a great year for stocks, the GOP delegation on Capitol Hill significantly underperformed the S&P 500.\n\nTo be sure, some Republicans in Congress were big winners. For example, Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee saw his stocks soar over 122%. The portfolios of Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana and Rep. David Rouzer of North Carolina more than doubled in 2023. They were the outliers, though.\n\nDemocrats' not-so-subtle secret to success\n\nWhy did Democrats' gains trounce those of Republicans last year? Looking at the types of stocks the two parties invested in reveals the Democrats' not-so-subtle secret to success.\n\nRepublicans invested much more heavily in financial services stocks, oil stocks, and commodities than Democrats did. The banking crisis hurt bank stocks in 2023. Lower oil prices prevented most oil stocks from beating the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats as a group put more money in tech stocks. The impressive stock market gains of 2023 were due in large part to the terrific performances of the tech-heavy \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nAll of the gains achieved by the top-performing Democrat member of Congress, Rep. Higgins, were due to his investment in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was a popular pick for other Democratic members of Congress as well.\n\nNvidia benefited tremendously from the excitement over generative AI. The company couldn't keep up with the demand for its chips. Despite increased competition, Nvidia's graphics process units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for powering generative AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon and Tesla were also among Democrats' favorite stocks. Both also enjoyed a tailwind from the AI boom. Amazon's shares soared 81% last year, while Tesla stock more than doubled.\n\nShould you invest like congressional Democrats now?\n\nJust as the political fortunes of Democrats and Republicans can shift over time, so can their investing gains. There's no guarantee that the kinds of stocks favored by Democrats last year will outperform those bought more heavily by Republicans in the future.\n\nValuation could be a key factor in the pendulum swinging. For example, Nvidia (a top stock with Democratic members of Congress in 2023) now trades at over 36 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, the forward earnings multiple for ConocoPhillips (an oil stock popular with Republicans) is only 13.8. It's possible that investing sentiment will move away from stocks priced at premium valuations to those with more attractive valuations.\n\nLikewise, geopolitical events could shake things up. An escalation of the turmoil in the Middle East would likely cause oil prices to jump with oil stocks moving in lockstep.\n\nStill, I think tech stocks -- including Nvidia -- should deliver exceptional returns over the long run thanks largely to the increasing adoption of AI. Regardless of which political party you like the most, investing in technology could pay off handsomely over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $19,668!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $31,136!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $299,328!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 15, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Outgain Nvidia Over the Next 12 Months",
        "content": "Kids have played \"King of the Hill\" for years. The game's goal is for one player to try to remain at the top of the hill while other players attempt to take their place.\n\nCompanies play this game too. And in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) reigns as king. So far, no rival has been able to knock the chipmaker off its perch at the top.\n\nHowever, Nvidia might not be the best AI stock to own in the near term. Here are three AI stocks Wall Street thinks will outgain Nvidia over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is one of Nvidia's biggest rivals. It's way behind Nvidia in the AI chip market. While AMD stock has soared over the last 12 months, Nvidia has outperformed it by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, Wall Street thinks that could change. The consensus 12-month price target for AMD reflects an upside potential of nearly 16%. That's a much more bullish outlook than the expected gain of less than 11% implied by the average analysts' price target for Nvidia.\n\nWhy do many analysts favor AMD over Nvidia over the next year? Much of their optimism stems from AMD's introduction of its new AI chips. In December, AMD rolled out its Instinct MI300X chip. Tech giants including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Oracle plan to use this new chip. A few days ago, AMD also unveiled its Ryzen Pro AI chips for desktops and laptops. The company has great expectations for the AI PC market.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) once held the spot as the undisputed king in the global chip market. However, technology changes and some poor decisions by the company have changed the game. Intel's modest gains over the last 12 months reflect the new reality.\n\nAnalysts look for the outlook for Intel to improve, though. The average 12-month price target for the stock is 18% above the current share price. One especially bullish analyst projects that Intel could skyrocket by nearly 80%.\n\nIt's not shocking that many Wall Street are newly enamored with Intel. Earlier this month, the company introduced its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. Intel claimed that the chip delivered 50% better inference and 40% better power efficiency on average than Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU -- but \"at a fraction of the cost.\"\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUnlike AMD and Intel, UiPath(NYSE: PATH) isn't a direct competitor with Nvidia. Instead, the company is a leader in the robotic process automation (RPA) market. UiPath uses AI to automate a wide range of online tasks. Its strategic partners feature of \"who's who\" of top-tier technology consultants, including Accenture, Deloitte, and IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath's shares have retreated significantly after delivering huge gains in recent months. However, Wall Street expects a big rebound. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 45%. Even the most pessimistic analyst surveyed by LSEG thinks UiPath's shares can jump 24% over the next 12 months.\n\nThere are several reasons analysts like UiPath. The company's sales are growing rapidly -- 31% year over year in 2023 Q4. UiPath recently achieved its first quarter of profitability since its IPO in 2021.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these AI stocks?\n\nWe'll have to wait 12 months to see if Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and UiPath deliver gains anywhere close to analysts' price targets. A lot could happen in the near term that helps or hurts any of these companies.\n\nHowever, I think Wall Street's bullish views about these AI stocks are justified over the long term. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel should have tremendous opportunities with the rising demand for AI chips. UiPath should benefit from the growing adoption of AI-powered process automation. I'm not sure which of these stocks will be the \"King of the Hill\" next year or a decade from now, but I suspect they'll all be solid winners.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on SoundHound AI? Buy Nvidia Instead",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past six months, rising close to 128% during this period. But if you're one of those who missed this AI stock's outstanding rally and are thinking of buying it right now, it would be a better idea to look elsewhere.\n\nThat's because SoundHound stock has pulled back substantially of late thanks to concerns that its growth may not be strong enough to support its rich valuation. Shares of the company, which provides voice AI solutions, are down nearly 55% in the past month. Despite this sharp pullback, SoundHound AI stock is trading at 22 times sales. That's substantially higher than the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.2.\n\nOf course, SoundHound is projecting robust revenue growth in 2024 and beyond, and also claims to have a solid revenue pipeline. But SoundHound is a small company and there is a good chance of it running into stiff competition from well-heeled rivals. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock right now might want to consider buying an established name such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nNvidia is growing at a much faster pace than SoundHound AI\n\nNvidia is the dominant player in the fast-growing market for AI chips. It commands an estimated 90%-plus share of the market, and as a result, business has been growing rapidly in recent quarters. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAs the chart above shows, Nvidia's growth has been much stronger than that of SoundHound AI. That's despite the fact that Nvidia is a much bigger company and generated almost $61 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year), an increase of 126% over the prior year. SoundHound AI, on the other hand, finished 2023 with a 47% increase in revenue to $46 million.\n\nWhat's more, analysts are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to clock faster growth in the current fiscal year as well. The chipmaker's top line is predicted to increase 81% to $110.5 billion in fiscal 2025, which would be higher than the 51% revenue growth that SoundHound is expected to deliver this year. So Nvidia's robust share of the AI chip market, which is slated to clock an annual growth rate of 61% through 2027, puts it in a terrific position to sustain its healthy growth momentum.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is a profitable company. It reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 73.8% in fiscal 2024, a nice jump from 59.2% in the previous year. This strong jump in the company's margin, which can be attributed to Nvidia's robust pricing power in AI chips, explains why its adjusted net income shot up to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2024 from $8.4 billion in the preceding year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $89 million in 2023. Though that was lower than the $117 million loss it reported in 2022, analysts aren't expecting it to turn profitable any time soon. SOUN EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is expected to deliver annual earnings growth of almost 38% for the next five years. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia delivering faster growth. That's because Nvidia is on track to benefit from a much larger addressable opportunity that includes markets such as gaming, automotive, and digital twins.\n\nMore specifically, the global GPU market is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 34% through 2032, generating revenue of $773 billion at the end of the forecast period. We have already seen that Nvidia is the leading company in the market for AI GPUs, and it holds a similar position in the personal computer (PC) GPU market as well. This market presents another lucrative growth opportunity for Nvidia.\n\nSimilarly, the digital twin market presents another multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for the company. SoundHound AI, meanwhile, expects its addressable market to grow to $160 billion by 2026. All this indicates that Nvidia has more room for growth in the long run. That's why choosing the chipmaker over SoundHound looks like a smart move, especially considering the forward valuation multiples of both companies.\n\nThe valuation makes buying Nvidia stock a no-brainer\n\nNvidia is trading at 36 times sales, which is higher than SoundHound's trailing sales multiple. But the situation changes when we look at the forward sales multiples. NVDA PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nBoth stocks have an identical forward P/S ratio. Moreover, Nvidia's solid profitability tells us why it is trading at 36 times forward earnings, which is lower than the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple of 45.\n\nWe have already seen that Nvidia is a better growth stock when compared to SoundHound, and it could continue growing at a faster pace in the future as well. So investors who missed SoundHound's rally and are looking for an AI stock to buy right now would do well to choose Nvidia, as it seems in a better position to deliver gains to investors in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff admits he'd ‘be a lot richer’ if he'd just invested in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "Can You Afford to Ignore These 3 Stocks Up Over 200% in 2024?",
        "content": "Buying stocks up over 200% in 2024 is a tricky proposition. On one hand, you don’t want to fight momentum. Plenty of shorts have been burned trying to time a reversal in momentum for hot stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even former meme stock megalith Gamestop (NYSE:GME). Likewise, plenty of bulls have gotten cut trying to catch a falling knife, hoping for a resurgence. Still, determining which stocks will keep pumping and which — like Gamestop — are a dumpster fire is tough.\n\nEach of these three stocks, up over 200% in 2024, slashes that opposing sentiment, though. All have bullish tailwinds propelling them higher, with unique factors helping buffer against wider market meltdowns. In other words, it may not be too late to ride the momentum even higher despite their existing 200%+ surge thus far.\n\nMediaCo Holding (MDIA) Radio microphone in a soundproofed room with an \"on air\" sign in the background.\n\nSource: radioshoot/ShutterStock.com\n\nMediaCo Holding (NASDAQ:MDIA) is a terrestrial radio and broadcasting media stock — not something you’d think would surge more than 200% ever, let alone in just a few short months. But, bucking expectations, this stock surged 361% since January 1st.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA fair amount of MediaCo’s recent gains came on the heels of an announcement that hedge fund Standard General LP snagged a sizeable 95% stake in the firm. Bordering on full-blown acquisition territory, the move telegraphed two messages to investors. First, hedge fund CEO Soohyung Kim is betting big on MediaCo’s future, and second, we can expect some degree of activism from Kim to push per-share pricing higher.\n\nThat shareholder activism may already be bearing fruit, as the company just announced a major acquisition of Estrella Media, diversifying MediaCo’s presence further into Spanish-language demographics and markets. Better yet, new interim CEO Jacqueline Hernandez is a former Telemundo exec who understands what that market needs and how to target it. Massive initial gains in 2024 may be just the beginning for this stock already up over 200%.\n\nRoot (ROOT) A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons related to health insurance. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoot (NASDAQ:ROOT) is blowing past our 200% gain benchmark. This stock has already returned nearly twice that in 2024. Root’s stock is soaring because of continued AI enthusiasm and a shockingly strong fourth-quarter earnings report. Root is a digital insurance provider targeting auto owners, renters and homeowners that leverages AI to analyze potential clients and gather real-time driving data to optimize premium management and reduce loss risks.\n\nIn 2023, Root reported a 31% increase in gross written premiums to $783 million, although gross earned premiums dropped 1% to $636 million. The company also halved its net losses to $147 million, marking its best year ever. Analysts swarmed the stock following the breakout, with Jefferies setting the stage by quadrupling its price target and saying the company is “setting a path to profitable growth, market share gains and scalability for a viable business model.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market rewarded Root’s efforts, with its stock climbing 400% since January and a staggering 1,127% over the past year. Though still trudging along a path toward profitability, Root is making significant progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) may lag slightly behind our other stocks, but the AI-driven stock has popped more than 225% since January. SMCI capitalizes on its role in the ever-expanding artificial intelligence sector but also seems to have greater upside potential even as AI’s top stocks lose steam. The company supplies server-sized computing solutions and counts major players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) among its clients.\n\nFundamentally, Super Micro Computer exemplifies the idea that the most promising semiconductor and AI investment opportunities may reside with upstream suppliers — those providing “picks and shovels” — rather than with end-user companies facing intense competition within the sector.\n\nThis is evident when comparing the company’s price-to-earnings ratio of “just” 66x against Nvidia’s 97x. While not direct comparisons, this disparity suggests that, despite a 200% increase, Super Micro Computer is slightly undervalued compared to one of its major downstream clients that’s captured the lion’s share of wider AI exuberance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Tesla: Here Are 2 Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- has continued to outperform the broader market, up 15% year to date as a group, compared to a 6% return from the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHowever, not all stocks in this group have lived up to its label recently. Shares of Nvidia and Amazon have been two of the best performers, up 76% and 20% year to date, respectively. Meanwhile, Tesla stock has fallen 37% this year, as it is struggling to grow sales of electric vehicles (EVs) amid rising interest rates.\n\nAccelerating growth in a company's revenue and profits usually leads to superior shareholder returns, and Nvidia and Amazon still have near-term catalysts that could support higher share prices. Here's why these two Magnificent Seven stocks are still solid choices.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nCompanies are investing heavily to build and train computing models with artificial intelligence (AI). This is pushing the world's largest data center operators to plan significant increases in capacity over the next few years. This spells a tremendous growth opportunity for Nvidia, a leading data center supplier.\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is in short supply and sells for the price of a Tesla Model 3. But unlike with Tesla, demand for Nvidia's product is exploding. Nvidia's revenue jumped 126% last year, and management expects its next-generation chips to remain supply-constrained due to high demand.\n\nAlmost every industry is using AI in some form. That's why about $1 trillion of data-center infrastructure is transitioning to GPU-centric computing systems to handle the rigorous demands of AI processing.\n\nCompanies rely on Nvidia because of its multidecade GPU innovation. The company recently unveiled its next-generation Blackwell B200 chip. This new AI chip will reportedly cost between $30,000 to $40,000, and Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla are expected to be early adopters.\n\nThe Wall Street consensus expects Nvidia to grow earnings by 89% this year. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 seems on the low side for that level of growth, but it seems investors are already anticipating that Nvidia won't be able to sustain this high level of growth for long, as companies with $60 billion of annual revenue usually can't.\n\nHowever given the large amount of data center infrastructure that is in the early stages of switching over to more advanced hardware, Nvidia should grow revenue and profits at double-digit rates for several more years. That should lead to market-beating returns from current share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported accelerating growth from its online stores in the fourth quarter as the e-commerce market recovers. It appears the impact of high inflation on consumer spending a few years ago is starting to fade. Even Amazon's cloud services business, which generates most of the company's operating profit, experienced an uptick in growth toward the end of the year. The company entered 2024 with growing momentum across the business.\n\nThe key catalyst that could send the stock higher from here is the company's improving profitability. The e-commerce leader spent years investing billions to expand its transportation capabilities and same-day delivery across major cities. Management is now focused on reaping the rewards of these investments. Operating profit soared in Q4, up 383% year over year, and there's more to come.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy noted in the recent annual shareholder letter that Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per-unit basis for the first time since 2018, and it still has more work to do. Roth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni estimates Amazon still has over 20% efficiencies to gain in the supply chain. This should translate to even higher profits. The current Wall Street consensus has Amazon's earnings per share more than doubling over the next two years.\n\nDespite the stock's gains so far this year, it still trades at a price-to-sales ratio that is in line with its previous 10-year average -- a period when margins from online sales were lower due to the company's heavy focus on expanding its e-commerce capabilities. If Amazon continues to increase its profit margin over the next decade, it might earn an even higher valuation and fuel market-beating returns for investors.\n\nThe stock could pull back if there's another market dip, but looking ahead a few years, I believe Amazon offers attractive upside potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It's rare for a $2 trillion stock to fall on no direct news, but that's exactly what happened to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) today.\n\nShares of the AI chip leader got swept up in a broader AI sell-off after one analyst noted that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), another AI stock leader, failed to report preliminary revenue, casting doubt on its upcoming results.\n\nThat news caused Nvidia to fall 10%, while Supermicro lost 23.1% today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI momentum shifts\n\nUp until this month, AI stocks had skyrocketed this year on blowout growth and excitement for the breakthrough technology. At one point, Nvidia stock had nearly doubled year to date, following another blockbuster earnings report in February, and its market cap topped $2 trillion.\n\nHowever, as this week's sell-off indicates, much of those gains were primarily driven by sentiment and a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the AI boom.\n\nWhen stocks have already made gains of several hundred percent like Nvidia and Supermicro have, it doesn't take much for those gains to unwind, and that seems to be what's happening here.\n\nA negative piece of news causes a little bit of selling, which leads to a flood as investors race to lock in profits before a potential bubble burst.\n\nIs Nvidia stock in trouble?\n\nThe observation that drove the sell-off could easily be a nonevent, as a Wells Fargo analyst noted that Supermicro did not give its customary preliminary revenue report, possibly implying that its quarterly results were weaker than expected.\n\nThat's entirely speculation, however, Investors should also be aware that an event like that wouldn't normally cause a stock to plunge 23% like Supermicro did, but it has been highly volatile and propped up in part by momentum and sentiment.\n\nAs far as Nvidia is concerned, the GPU maker is a close partner of Supermicro, but Nvidia is much larger, meaning it's not particularly sensitive to Supermicro's results.\n\nStill, sentiment in the AI sector tends to move these stocks in unison, and Nvidia has also benefited from enthusiasm and high expectations for AI, so it's not surprising to see the stock falling in line with Supermicro.\n\nIt's too soon to know if today's sell-off is meaningful. Keep an eye on Supermicro's Q3 earnings report, which is due out after hours on April 30, as that will confirm or reverse today's sell-off. Expect Nvidia to move in tandem with Super Micro Computer after that news comes out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Trading Lower Today",
        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 10% in the afternoon session after major indices declined with the Nasdaq down 2.1% while the S&P 500 fell by 0.9%. Netflix reported mixed results to kick off the new earnings season. The video-streaming giant provided underwhelming sales guidance for the full year and guided for growth to decelerate in the second half of the year. Also, Netflix surprisingly announced it will stop disclosing subscriber count (starting in the first quarter of 2025), and this is contributing to the market's concerns about the business. The company's post-earnings stock decline is likely dampening the sentiment toward tech stocks.\n\nIt was a challenging week for most risk assets following news of escalating tension between Israel and Iran, which is raising concerns among investors, given the potential disruptions to business supply chains, especially in the Middle East. These add to the ongoing inflation worries after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected. On April 16, 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, adding, \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" This suggests the Fed might not lower its policy rates as fast as anticipated in 2024, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts for the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 9 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago, when the stock gained 23.7% on the news that the company delivered an exceptional quarter that topped analysts' estimates across key metrics. Revenue surpassed expectations by an impressive 10.3%, driven by strong data center revenue. Notably, the company improved profitability, with both gross margin and operating margin outperforming expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) beat by an impressive 18.8%. Inventory levels experienced a nice decrease during the quarter. In addition to the outstanding quarterly results, the revenue guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations by over 50%. Yes, that's not a typo. Similarly, the operating profit guidance exceeded Consensus estimates meaningfully.\n\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the ongoing transformations in the computer industry, particularly the advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI. He highlighted Nvidia's readiness to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated trillion-dollar shift in global data center infrastructure from general-purpose to accelerated computing, as firms implement generative AI into their business operations.\n\nOverall, the company's blowout quarter, with its impressive revenue growth, enhanced profitability, and positive guidance, underscored its strength in the market. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this was a near-perfect quarter.\n\nNvidia is up 58.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $764.31 per share it is still trading 19.5% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,239.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "(0:30) - Finding Strong Investments With A Competitive Edge In Their Industries (4:45) - Top Stock Picks With Moats: Tracey’s Watchlist (34:00) - Episode Roundup: AMZN, NFLX, NVDA, URI, HEES, SHW, CTAS, BA, VLO Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #366 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThis week, Tracey is looking at companies that have moats.\n\nWarren Buffett has talked about moats many times over the years. He loves companies that have one.\n\nWhat is a Moat?\n\nA moat is literally what it says. It is a wide ditch that surrounds a castle or a town which provides protection in case of an attack.\n\nIn the case of companies, it’s when the company has some kind of competitive advantage in its industry that others cannot overcome. That company can pull up the drawbridge, so to speak.\n\nBut there are several ways to get to moat status. A company can get a moat by being “first in” in a new industry or product. But it will eventually lose its competitive advantage. Think of Apple and the iPhone. It had a moat, initially, in 2007 but that didn’t last long.\n\nA company can also get a moat by being so big it can behave in a particular way when its competitors cannot. Amazon, for example, is one of the few companies that can afford to grow a network of distribution centers across the globe.\n\nHow Can You Find Moat Stocks?\n\nThere really is not a screen for a moat stock. You mostly know them when you see them.\n\n1. Netflix (NFLX)\n\nNetflix has had two moats in its lifespan. The first was the little red envelope in which it used to send out DVDs to customers. It was the first in in mailing DVDs on a big scale.\n\nNetflix’s second moat was the streaming service. It was also first in on that. Netflix is trading at 35x forward earnings. It’s not cheap on a classic value basis.\n\nDoes Netflix still have its moat after a half a dozen other streaming services have entered the game?\n\n2. United Rentals, Inc. (URI)\n\nUnited Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. If that’s not a moat, I don’t know what is.\n\nShares of United Rentasl hit new highs earlier in the year, but have fallen 7.4% in the last month. United Rentals is cheap, with a forward P/E of 14.8. Investors also get a dividend, yielding 1%.\n\nShould investors look outside of technology to a company like United Rentals to find moats?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is one of the largest producers of chips for AI. For now. NVIDIA is also one of the top companies in gaming chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are bullish. NVIDIA’s sales are expected to rise 73.8% this year and earnings are forecast to jump 84%.\n\nDoes NVIDIA have first in advantage on AI which gives it moat status?\n\n4. Cintas Corp. (CTAS)\n\nCintas makes uniforms and other items businesses need to get ready for the work day. Cintas is a large cap company with a market cap of $67.2 billion.\n\nShares have been on a tear the last 5 years, gaining 210% versus the S&P 500 at just 72.5%. But it’s not cheap. Cintas trades with a high P/E of 44.8.\n\nDoes Cintas have a moat in the uniform business?\n\n5. Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)\n\nValero Energy is the largest independent refiner in the United States. It owns 15 refineries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Valero Energy has a market cap of $53 billion.\n\nValero is cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.6. It pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.6%.\n\nThere hasn’t been a new refinery built in the United States in decades and refineries are billion-dollar facilities. It take a lot of cash to build one.\n\nDoes Valero have a moat thanks to the high costs of entry?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Moats?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "12 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in. To know more about the top stocks, go directly to 5 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In.\n\nForbes asked a group of experts about the changing global landscape and its effect on investors. These experts included Justin Onuekwusi (JO), Kasim Zafar (KZ), and EQ Investors. They discussed the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on investors in 2024 and shed light on the significance of geographic diversification. The US presidential elections can also introduce uncertainty into the markets, especially if the outcome is uncertain or if there's a perception that it could significantly alter economic policies. Diversification remains a key strategy for investors to mitigate the risks associated with such geopolitical uncertainties. By spreading investments across different geographic regions, asset classes, and industries, investors can potentially reduce the impact of any single event or market downturn on their overall portfolio.\n\nInvestment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has gained momentum, especially because of diversification. It has opened many opportunities for numerous investors that enable them to make informed decisions based on current market conditions. ETFs hold a collection of securities that offer investors benefit of immediate diversification by spreading investment across multiple assets. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is one of the popular ETF that aims to replicate the performance of the entire S&P 500 index with low annual fees of only 30 cents against a $1000 investment. Moving forward, substantial potential for growth and innovation in ETF space is expected due to its ability to allow investors to tailor investments to their financial goals and risk levels. ETFs are traded on a stock exchange, unlike its chief rival mutual funds among retail investors. According to Morningstar, investors withdrew over $900 billion from mutual funds in 2022 and funneled about $600 billion into ETFs and PwC anticipates total global ETF assets could exceed $20 trillion by 2026. If you are a beginner investor, investing in ETFs is a good idea because you will generate the average performance of the market in your portfolio. If you'd like to generate higher than average returns, you need to identify stocks with large upside potential. Sites like Insider Monkey is a good starting point to identify such stocks. For example, hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here) and Insider Monkey shares the list of these stocks periodically.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an era where investors are predisposed to geopolitical unrest because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing power rivalry between US and China, it is imperative to adopt more diversified and flexible investment strategies. Diversification is a viable option for investors to help insulate portfolios, especially during times of economic recession and geopolitical unrest.\n\nWarren Buffett, in his recent annual letter, mentioned that his sprawling conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway possesses the largest net worth among all American businesses, amounting to around 6% of the combined net worth of all S&P 500 companies. The conglomerate’s stock has surged approximately 16% in 2024, more than double the S&P 500’s return, following a similar 16% increase in 2023 and the market value has gone up to $900 billion. Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy is against the common practice of over diversification. He has emphasized enough on the importance of quality over quantity in investment choices and suggested a deep conviction and understanding of a few chosen companies for significant health creation.\n\nLooking forward to 2025, investors, in view of diversification, may allocate funds to assets such as bonds, Public Provident Fund, gold, real estate and bank deposits that are more secure investment alternatives. The 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds needs to be modernized as the unprecedented spike in inflation and interest rates in 2022 clobbered stocks and bonds. Therefore, investors might contemplate reallocating 10% portion from 60% of which is allocated for stocks to secure asset classes offering higher yields such as banks are offering 5% to 5.5% on high yield accounts.\n\nAnalysts have predicted continued acceleration in S&P 500 earnings, forecasting 3.9% year-over-year growth in Q1, followed by a further increase of 9% in Q2 of 2024. And a substantial growth of 20.8% in earnings has been witnessed in the technology sector, driven by the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a remarkable increase of 265% in revenue for Q4.\n\nSome of the best diversified stocks to invest in based on hedge funds’ assessments are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). For this, we decided to take a look the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the best diversified stocks to invest in, we filtered companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq having multiple product lines and several revenue streams. The stocks were then ranked according to their hedge fund sentiment data which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 best hedge funds at the end of Q4 last year. The ranking was based on the ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each stock and then the top 12 best diversified stocks were selected for investment purposes.\n\nBest Diversified Stocks To Invest In\n\n12.

        "title": "Can Q1 Earnings Results Recharge Semiconductor ETFs?",
        "content": "In a noteworthy market shift, the semiconductor sector, led by Nvidia NVDA, has been struggling in recent months, with the broader Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index entering a correction phase, declining more than 10% from its record high in March. The index is down nearly 8.5% in a week. Notably, the sector is heading for the worst performance in a month.\r\n\r\nThis signals a sharp downturn after 18 months of robust performance in equity markets on growing concerns about the long-term demand outlook for semiconductors. The sector has also been hit by concerns over the delayed prospect of interest rate cuts and China’s weak economy. As such, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have lost more than 4% each over the past week.\r\n\r\nASML Holding NV ASML, a major player in the chipmaking equipment sector, was one of the biggest losers after reporting a steep decline in bookings during the first quarter. This has triggered concerns about a likely downturn in the semiconductor industry (read: Pain or Gain Ahead of Semiconductor ETFs?).\r\n\r\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM also failed to impress investors following its first-quarter results. Though the company beat estimates on both revenues and earnings, driven by continued strong demand for advanced chips, it dialed back its outlook for chip market expansion, cautioning that the smartphone and personal-computing markets remain weak.\r\n\r\nNow, will the fortunes rebound with more well-known players in the space, such as Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research LRCX, Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA NVDA, expected to report earnings in the coming weeks? Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies with a higher allocation in the abovementioned ETFs and see their power to move the funds up or down as the earnings season unfolds. SHOC is largely concentrated on these firms with a combined share of 49%, followed by 41.8% for SMH, 40.8% for SOXQ, 35.6% for SOXX and 34.4% for FTXL.\r\n\r\nPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nInside Our Earnings Prediction\n\nTexas Instruments is set to report on Apr 23, after market close. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The earnings surprise track over the last four quarters has been good, with the beat being 3.22%, on average.\r\n\r\nLam Research has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings surprise track over the last four quarters has been good, with the beat being 11.33%, on average.\r\n\r\nIntel has an Earnings ESP of -0.32% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 154.49%, on average, for the preceding four quarters. It is slated to release earnings after market close on Apr 25.\r\n\r\nQualcomm has an Earnings ESP of +6.15% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company witnessed a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. Qualcomm delivered an earnings surprise of 5.90% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is slated to report earnings after the closing bell on May 1 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 2.96% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. AMD is slated to report earnings on Apr 30 after the closing bell.\r\n\r\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. This leading U.S. chip designer saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Nvidia delivered an earnings surprise of 20.18%, on average, in the last four quarters. Nvidia is slated to report on May 22 (read: What's Ahead for Nvidia ETFs?).\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a few companies are expected to deliver a surprise this earnings season and none witnessed any negative earnings estimate revision activity over the past week amid the deteriorating industry fundamentals, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead. The abovementioned semiconductor ETFs have either a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or #2, suggesting that they can outperform in the weeks ahead.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 best cheap phones for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Cheap Phones for 2024.\n\nOverview of the Global Smartphone Industry\n\nThe global smartphone industry is one of the fastest evolving industries and experiences regular updates and new smartphone devices to boost user experience and utility. According to a report by Mondor Intelligence, the global smartphone market was valued at $1.51 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.10% to reach $1.85 billion by 2029.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region holds the greatest market share mainly due to its highly developing telecommunication infrastructure and large customer base. Some of the leading countries with the most sophisticated technology infrastructure in the region include India, Indonesia, Japan, Australia, China, and South Korea. On April 5, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in collaboration with Indonesia’s telecommunication firm, PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison Tbk (IDX:ISAT), plans to invest $200 million in 2024 to build an artificial intelligence center in Surakarta, Indonesia. The AI center is expected to further boost Indonesia's technology infrastructure and include a human resource center.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) to secure the highest smartphone sales market share. Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) has led the smartphone market for over 12 years. However, in the fiscal 4th quarter of 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the top position in the market for the first time in over a decade.

According to a report by The Guardian, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) global shipment of iPhones went down from 55.4 million to 50.1 million during the first quarter of 2024. This steep drop in sales of iPhones has been the biggest ever since COVID-19 and is mainly due to the Chinese government's ban on foreign devices. Apple Inc.

        "content": "Semiconductors have become so ubiquitous and important in our modern lives that people refer to the tiny electronic wafers as the “oil of the 21st century.” McKinsey & Co. has labeled the 2020s the “semiconductor decade” and forecast that the global industry will be worth $1 trillion by 2030. The entire sector has been riding high over the last 18 months as artificial intelligence captures people’s imaginations and has come to dominate the corporate world. This has led to this list of semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nFor more than a year now, semiconductor stocks have outperformed and led the market higher, fueled by AI demand. Some semiconductor stocks have seen their share price triple over the past 12 months. Can the red hot rally last? While share prices are pulling back with the broader market right now, the long-term trade looks to still be intact. Analysts seem to be in agreement that we are in the early innings of the AI revolution. Here are three semiconductor stocks to buy now: Q2 edition.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s a few reasons to consider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) right now. The semiconductor company has been awarded $8.5 billion from the U.S. government through the Chips and Science Act, which will help it build manufacturing facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. Intel also recently unveiled a brand new AI microchip called the “Gaudi 3” that the company says can be used to train and deploy AI models and chatbots. The new chip should be available in the third quarter of this year and help to boost future sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel claims the new Gaudi 3 chip is twice as power-efficient and one-and-a-half times faster than rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing H100 microchip that is widely used with AI. INTC stock currently looks like a buy-the-dip candidate having fallen 25% on the year. A report at the start of April that the company’s manufacturing business lost $7 billion hasn’t helped the share price. But better days look to be ahead with the government funding secured and the new AI chip coming to market. This makes it one of those semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere was a lot of concern about Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) stock in March. Wall Street was expecting a big selloff as the lock-up period expired following the British semiconductor company’s initial public offering (IPO) last September. There were worries that Arm’s largest shareholder, SoftBank Group, which owns 90% of the company or about 900 million shares, was going to dump the stock. Mercifully, that didn’t happen and SoftBank looks to be invested in ARM stock for the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of ARM stock, it has risen 56% year to date and has gained 77% since its IPO less than a year ago. The share price has been ripping higher since the company reported a profit for the fourth quarter of 2023, its first full quarter as a publicly traded company, and issued bullish forward guidance. It’s worth noting that Arm’s chips are used in nearly every smartphone and most computers in the world.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor company Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has doubled in the last 12 months and continues to perform well. The company also closed its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing firm VMware late last year, further expanding its reach and influence. And, Broadcom’s earnings are getting a boost from strong AI demand. These factors all make AVGO stock worth buying now. The 23 analysts who cover the company rate its shares a “strong buy” with an average price target that’s 22% higher than current levels.\n\nThe company’s fourth quarter 2023 financial results were very strong, with Broadcom announcing earnings per share of $10.99, beating Wall Street estimates of $10.40. Revenue in the quarter totaled $11.96 billion, which was also above estimates of $11.80 billion. Management continues to stress that they are seeing strong demand for their chips in AI data centers. Broadcom’s semiconductors are also used in networking, server storage, and industrial applications. The company next reports earnings on June 12. All in all, it’s one of those semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NVDA) a Solid Buy as it Squashes Bubble Fears",
        "content": "After concluding 2023 on a high note, NVIDIA Corporation’s NVDA shares are off to a flying start this year. The pioneer in graphic processing units (GPUs) recorded the largest one-day gain in the history of Wall Street on Feb 22, banking on an artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy.\n\nNVIDIA’s shares have skyrocketed 70.8% this year and have surpassed the Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 48.5%. So far this year, NVIDIA has outshined other magnificent seven stocks and is now the third-largest company in the United States, lagging only behind Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, NVIDIA’s stellar surge has made skeptics believe that the stock is in a bubble. After all, stretched valuations and any potential decrease in AI-linked demand for NVIDIA’s chips may lead to a significant decline in the stock price. But NVIDIA isn’t in a bubble! The company’s share prices aren’t gathering momentum based on speculation but due to strong fundamental factors.\n\nThe unquenchable demand for AI models is here to stay since it is a major driving force behind productivity gains across multiple industries. While Meta Platforms, Inc. META confirmed that the adaptation of AI tools has boosted returns from its ad campaigns, UBS Group AG UBS expects the integration of AI to drive productivity growth over the next three years.\n\nNow, NVIDIA’s chips are required for AI models deployed across several verticals from manufacturing to cloud computing. This explains why NVIDIA’s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after commodity in the AI chip market. Such massive demand, thus, has justifiably led to an uptick in NVIDIA’s revenues and earnings.\n\nNVIDIA’s revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $22.1 billion, up a solid 265% from a year ago. For the quarter ending on Jan 28, 2024, the company’s earnings per share came in at $4.93, up a whopping 765% from a year ago. What’s more, the company’s data center business, which is involved in the production of the H100 graphic cards, was able to dismiss the negative impact of government restrictions on exporting AI semiconductors to China.\n\nIn reality, NVIDIA is expected to introduce the B200 Blackwell graphics card to the market. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, will produce the powerful AI graphics card, which incidentally has received funding from the U.S. government. This explains why NVIDIA is cheerful about its forthcoming growth and expects revenues of $24 billion for the ongoing quarter, easily beating estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it’s just not about NVIDIA, the euphoria behind the broader AI-boom is not hype, unlike the dot-com era. Tech leaders are primarily involved in commercializing generative AI technology and they have more than double the market capitalization that companies had during the tech bubble in the late 1990s. Their profit margins and return on capital are also way more than the companies in the Internet bubble period. Hence, the strength in their underlying business validates the higher stock prices.\n\nOn this promising note, NVIDIA remains a market darling and razor-sharp investors should encash on its likely long-term upward movement. NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 84% and 14.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 73.8% and 17.9%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s current-year earnings has moved up 17.2% over the past 60 days.\n\nTo top it, NVIDIA’s net profit margin is an outstanding 48.9%, way more than the 20% threshold, signifying a high margin. This means the company is capable of generating the required profit from sales and has successfully kept operational costs under control. NVIDIA is also a cash-rich company making it immune to market upheavals. The company’s cash and cash equivalents were $25.98 billion as of Jan 28, 2024, up from $18.28 billion on Oct 29, 2023.\n\nNVIDIA, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

        "title": "Inflation-Proof Your Portfolio: 3 Overvalued Stocks to Dump Now",
        "content": "Sometimes, the trading price of a stock may seem too good to be true. That’s often because it is. Company valuations are a tricky business, they are often tied to a complex combination of financial performance and public perception. This can result in some companies listing as being worth more than their true intrinsic value on the stock market.\n\nIn times of inflation, the ultimate method of retaining wealth is holding appreciating assets instead of cash. As the value of cash depreciates, and buying power lessens, holding stocks that are overvalued could hurt long-term portfolio growth, as price corrections are inevitable.\n\nFurthermore, the market continues to look more and more like the bears are coming out, investors may want to consider which stocks are promising more than they can deliver. Thus, here are three of the most overvalued stocks to sell, should the market take a turn for the worse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the revolutionary leader in electric vehicle technology, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has consistently struggled with overvaluation. For many years, the company has consistently delivered on expectations, despite offering a product with questionable demand. That’s because, even though the electric car sounds like a life-changing technology, most people simply cannot afford a Tesla.\n\nThus, the company offers a premium solution in search of a marginal problem. As global economic factors like inflation and supply chain scarcity have squeezed consumers, many have begun questioning the real value of owning an electric car. Moreover, questions regarding range reliability in cold weather and overall travel practicality have begun eroding demand, thus slowing Tesla sales.\n\nPair this with recent restructuring efforts by Elon Musk, which led to a 10% workforce reduction, and the writing may be on the wall for Tesla. Though the company is certainly not going anywhere, investors who entered overvalued positions on the stock may want to consider a sale until the price corrects some more.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen was the last time Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) delivered an exceptional product? The company dominates neither the gaming sector or the creative sector, and its enterprise laptops are lackluster. Competitors from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ASUS (TPE:2357) have consistently provided better, more complete machines than Dell.\n\nWhy is it, then, that the company’s stock price has soared nearly 170% in the last year? A major contributing factor has been the company’s savvy partnerships with AI companies to provide server solutions. This, however, could genuinely be a product of hype, as the firm’s bottom line may not see the long-term growth in server sales necessary to maintain such an inflated share price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the company’s AI servers essentially offer packaged, inflexible iterations of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center Graphics Processing Units. Considering the cost of these GPUs, it’s likely that Dell’s margins are much thinner than the sales numbers might lead us to believe.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the clouds\n\nSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech companies aren’t the only stocks at risk of overvaluation. Take, for example, airline companies like Southwest Airlines, (NYSE:LUV) which occupies an awkward operational niche. Somewhere between a major international airline and a domestic regional one, Southwest Airlines’ cost of revenue holds back its earning potential. The reason, however, has little to do with customers, and everything to do with aircraft choices.\n\nDue to its size and niche as a domestic airline, Southwest chose to operate Boeing 737s as its sole aircraft type. Considering the present scandals surrounding the aircraft, Southwest likely has some issues in its future. Furthermore, the airline focuses almost exclusively on profitable routes within the U.S. borders.\n\nWhile this helps mitigate revenue costs, it limits the airline’s growth and exposure to new customers. The combination of these two factors could make Southwest one of the overvalued stocks to sell, should market conditions worsen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Having started the year on a highly optimistic note, the market has now turned into an uncertain zone. The inflation report and the pushback of Fed rate cuts have left investors worried. However, some stocks can survive a soft landing. These growth stocks weren’t made in a day. These companies have a rich history, solid long-term potential and the ability to keep going even in turmoil.\n\nIf the economy continues to grow, we will see these companies report higher earnings. With that in mind, let’s look at the growth stocks that can thrive in the long run. If you are ready to take the leap, invest $5,000 in these three growth stocks by 2025 and build a resilient portfolio.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: DraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) has trended 22% higher since the beginning of the year and 112% in the past 12 months. That is no small feat, considering the high-interest environment. Trading at $42 today, this growth stock is a solid buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe online sports betting sector is set to grow in the coming years, and that means DraftKings is in a strong position right now. The company could see a higher valuation over the decade. Currently, it only exists in a few states, and as more states legalize online sports betting, DraftKing’s market share will grow.\n\nFor Q4, 2023, the company reported a revenue of $1.23 billion, up 44% year-over-year (YoY), and reported a non-GAAP profit of $0.29 per share, up from the loss of $0.14 per share in the same period the previous year. Its monthly unique payers (MUP) stood at 3.5 million, and the average revenue per MUP came in at $116. For 2024, it is aiming for a revenue of $4.8 billion.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), have a bullish view on DKNG stock. Goldman Sachs has initiated the stock with a Buy rating with a price target of $60. It expects a 42% upside on the stock driven by healthy growth in existing states and an expansion after the legalization in other states. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $50 for the stock with an Overweight rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 14% year-to-date (YTD) and 23% in the year, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is making the most of the AI hype. Exchanging hands for $118 today, ORCL stock is racing ahead. It is building 100 data centers to expand its cloud services to other companies. That expansion is only the beginning as its current customers are more likely to adopt its solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a rich history and many years of experience in catering to the needs of clients. The company recently announced an investment of $8 billion in cloud computing and AI in Japan. Oracle reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% YOY revenue surge and a 29% YOY rise in the order backlog to over $80 billion.\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) recently signed a deal with Oracle to deliver AI solutions to the government, and it also has a contract with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), where both companies will market their software and AI chips.\n\nIt could be a win-win situation for both the tech giants. There is no stopping the growth of Oracle, and it could make you big gains by 2025. It also pays a dividend and yields 1.35%, making Oracle one of the best AI stocks to own.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo matter how the market moves from here, people will not stop shopping at Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company is a highly diversified business and has been holding strong over the past two years. Up 14% YTD, WMT stock is trading for $59 today, and I think it is highly undervalued. While it is close to the 52-week high of $61, it can keep moving higher.\n\nOne of the most popular retail chain stores, Walmart has been investing in the e-commerce businesses and saw a 23% surge in its global online sales in the fourth quarter. It manages more than 10,000 stores right now, and the business continues to focus on groceries, health and wellness products.\n\nKnown for offering lower-priced goods, the biggest grocery store chain isn’t affected by the ups and downs of the market. That ensures the company posts strong financials and the stocks keep rallying upwards. WMT stock has soared 74% over the past five years.\n\nAnother reason to put money in this growth stock is its dividend yield. Walmart stock enjoys a yield of 1.39%, which makes it even more attractive for passive income investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at ChatGPT Stock Predictions: 10 Stocks That Have 10X Potential. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our articleChatGPT Stock Predictions: 5 Stocks That Have 10X Potential.\n\nFrom taking customer service calls to composing music, AI has already started showing its prowess and impact all over the world. But can AI help investors in spotting potential multibaggers? Several reports show that hedge funds, venture capitalists and wise investors are using AI to their advantage. For example, California-based venture capital firm Sierra Ventures developed an AI software which would help the firm decide whether to invest in a startup. Talking to The Wall Street Journal, the firm's Managing Partner Mark Fernandes said that analysis from this software caused him pay attention to a promising startup that he would have otherwise ignored.\n\n\"If you think about the volume of deals coming in, I would’ve missed that,\" Fernandes said.\n\nHow Can AI Help Investors and Professional Stock Pickers?\n\nMike Wilson, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist & Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley, talked to Bloomberg about the impact of AI on businesses and his broader view on the economy. Wilson said that we are still in the early days of AI when it comes to the business world. He said that the \"real opportunity\" would be when AI is \"diffused\" to the economy and companies begin to adapt to AI technologies.  Wilson said so far the role of AI has been of an assistant rather than an enabler. But the power of AI in the investing world is fast becoming decisive as the technology helps companies make decisions potentially worth billions of dollars.\n\nIn the investing world, AI has been in action in some form over the past several years, as quant funds and high-performance trading firms rigorously used machine learning for sentiment analysis, finding patterns in stocks and predicting market movements. A research paper titled Artificial Intelligence applied to Stock Market Trading: A Review mentions several studies and academic researches describing the importance of using AI, machine learning and data-based predictive analysis in stock investing. For example, the research mentions a paper which analyzed stock returns when a data mining approach is incorporated where thousands of press releases from companies trading on NYSE and NSADAQ indices were processed.  The data-based analysis divided all press relapses in three categories: \"Good News,\" \"Bad News,\" and \"No Movers\" (for neutral news). The paper found out that good news result in significant stock jumps, while bad news cause stock dips. When this sentiment analysis is practiced, \"results show a recall of approximately 60% and a better cumulative return and average return per trade than the random trader in a stock market simulation.\" That's why in a world where data and AI-based analysis is the future, leaving everything to macro movements and randomness won't take an average investor far.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-based Sentiment Analysis on Stocks\n\nThe research paper also analyzed another study in which it pulled about 300,000 posts about Apple stock from investing-focused social media platform StockTwits during 2010-2017. Algorithms were then applied to perform sentiment analysis and compare it with historical price movements during this entire period (stock price data was pulled from Yahoo Finance).\n\n\"For sentiment prediction, the achieved test accuracy was 63.5%, 75.3% recall, and 76.8% precision, and for stock movement prediction, the completed test accuracy was 76.68%, 100% recall, and 69.5% precision,\" the research said. ChatGPT Stock Predictions: Stocks That Have 10X Potential\n\nPerformance and Returns of AI-Powered Funds and Indexes\n\nAmplify Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA: MJ) is up 18% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500 gain of just 4.5%. The fund, powered by IBM Watson platform, uses sentiment analysis, machine learning and quantum computing to process 10 years of historical data, millions of news articles and data points to analyze securities.  Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, an equally weighted index of 11 constituent funds using artificial intelligence and machine learning theory in their trading processes, is up 3.9% in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we asked ChatGPT to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff data, that have the potential to grow 10X in the next few years. Here is our exact prompt:\n\n\"Wear the hat of a stock trader and financial expert and recommend  stocks based on your knowledge that have the potential to 10X in the next few years.\"\n\nAs expected, ChatGPT first gave fair warnings that investing in stocks have risks and no one could say with certainty which stocks would grow ten times their current value in the future. But ChatGPT recommended 15 stocks based on  \"historical trends\" and the \"market landscape\" from various sectors which have \"substantial\" potential over the next few years. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of the end of 2023.

        "title": "Volatility Jackpot: 3 Ways to Cash in on the Coming Earnings Chaos",
        "content": "The end of the first quarter means another volatile earnings season. United States equities ended Q1 on a high note after an overall positive Q4 earning season. The two major U.S. stock market indices — the S&P500 and the Nasdaq — ended the first quarter up 10.2% and 9.1%, respectively. The small-to-mid cap index, the Russell 2000, trailed behind, only having risen 4.8% for the first quarter. While positive earnings and market trends, such as the generative AI craze, may have been enough to lift stocks for earnings volatility to new heights, macroeconomic volatility has come back into view. Moreover, the high trading multiples U.S. equities have risen to has also led to a lot of selling pressure in Q2.\n\nYesterday, Jerome Powell mentioned because of persistent inflation, interest rates would be higher for a longer period of time. This level of macroeconomic uncertainty could bring heavy amounts of volatility to the coming earning season. In this article, I’ll go through three stocks for earnings volatility.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that specializes in cloud-based endpoint protection and threat intelligence services. The company’s Q4 earnings underscored how a cybersecurity firm could grow even during economic uncertainty. In particular, CrowdStrike beat earnings Wall Street estimates and saw top-line growth in 2023, reaching 54% on a year-over-year basis, while revenue for the quarter increased 45% year-over-year. Despite the cybersecurity industry as a whole struggling with growth, CrowdStrike has continued to significantly improve top-line figures year-over-year. The company has also avoided job cuts unlike companies like Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and SentinelOne (NYSE:S).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCybersecurity is a space that is pretty sensitive to macroeconomic machinations. Once businesses feel the overall environment is cloud, they could delay or forgo any technological upgrades, which could slowdown business for companies like CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity firm has been able to blow past earnings estimates. For the company’s Q4 2023 earnings report, CrowdStrike’s revenue beat estimates modestly while its EPS was 15% higher than what analysts had been predicting, according to Koyfin. The firm’s share skyrocketed more than 10% after its earnings release.\n\nGiven if the company beats estimates again and reiterates strong guidance, especially during times of uncertainty, CRWD shares could skyrocket again.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is another option among stocks for earnings volatility. The data analytics firm released its AI Platform in the latter half of 2023, and subsequently, during the company’s Q3 results, overall revenue increased 17% to $558 million from $478 million a year earlier. However, most notably, Palantir’s “U.S. Commercial business segment” increased revenue figures by 37% on a year-over-basis driven by demand for Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform. The data analytics firm’s AIP can deploy commercial and open-source large language models onto internally held data sets and, from there, recommend business processes and actions.\n\nThis next earnings season for Palantir will, no doubt, focus on AIP again. Analysts will be looking for any traction that product has gained from potential customers. The company beat estimates in its last earnings release, which sent the stock soaring to a record stock price.\n\nThe question is not only whether or not Palantir could blow away estimates but also if the market continues to accept Palantir’s high stock-based compensation. In the company’s Q4 report, for example, SBC came in at $132.6 million and was the largest add-back line-item to get the “adjusted operating profit” figure. Palantir’s adjusted operating profit margin sat around 34% in Q4. If we count SBC as a real expense, margins would have been around 11%. This is similar for its adjusted EBITDA figure.\n\nDue to these concerns, there could definitely be some earnings volatility on PLTR shares based on how analysts view the company’s earnings figures.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a microchip. stocks for earnings volatility\n\nSource: Antonio Baccardi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the preeminent designer of AI-powering graphics cards, will also likely receive a lot of earnings volatility. The chipmaker is by far the leader in the AI chip space, and it’s easy to see why. Nvidia’s chip design prowess and ample R&D expense, which was $7.3 billion in 2023 (27.2% of 2023 revenue) and has floated between 1/5 and 1/4 of revenue over the past few years, has allowed Nvidia to effectively snap up 81% of the market for AI chips. Nvidia’s new flagship processors dubbed “Blackwell” will likely help Nvidia to maintain its lead against competitors.\n\nFor this earnings season, analysts will likely be focused on how Nvidia’s revenue and EPS figures will stack up against current estimates. Guidance will also be a major factor. Given interest rates are to be higher for longer, I’m sure analysts will be wondering if Nvidia’s growth rate will be sustainable. NVDA’s shares soared in double-digit territory and could do so again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 19, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. BR and Textron Inc. TXT.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Alphabet and Johnson & Johnson\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA has literally emerged as the market's collective play on the outlook for artificial intelligence; the stock is up +72.7% this year vs. +7.8% for the Zacks Tech sector and +5.6% for the S&P 500 index. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for GPU’s have resulted in the company’s stocks skyrocketing. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, while it is also leaving giant imprints on the Gaming and ProViz end markets.\n\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nAlphabet shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the last six months (+12.9% vs. +14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Alphabet’s sluggish network advertisement business have been casting a cloud over its prospects. Also, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\n\nYet, expanding data centers, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities and deepening focus on the wearables category remain major tailwinds. The company’s efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry as well as autonomous driving space also gives cause for optimism.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-10.9% vs. +15.6%).

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Winnebago Industries, Nvidia, Vista Energy, Constellation Energy and NRG Energy",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 19, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Winnebago Industries WGO, Nvidia NVDA, Vista Energy VST, Constellation Energy CEG and NRG Energy NRG.\n\nUnderappreciated Industry Benefits from A.I. Buildout\n\nAI Requires Data Centers\n\nData centers are integral to the AI buildout because they yield the computational power and storage necessary for training and deploying large language models like OpenAI, ChatGPT and Bard at scale. Running an LLM requites facilities that house numerous servers and specialized hardware optimized for tasks such as deep learning. Unfortunately, these complex systems require a ton of energy due to their intense processing demands and the persistent need for temperature (cooling) regulation.\n\nGrowth is Still in the Early Innings\n\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence, “The generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022. Growth could expand at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 42%, driven by training infrastructure in the near-term and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software and services in the medium to long term.”\n\nThe Race Is On\n\nIn the capitalist system of America, companies are jockeying for position and rushing to catch up to LLMs such as ChatGPT, the current market leader. Meanwhile, the race for AI supremacy is not only domestic. China, America’s most significant economic adversary, is behind the U.S. in terms of AI but is racing to catch up (and has a larger talent pool to choose from). Finally, the oil-rich and deep-pocketed nation of Saudi Arabia is allocating at least $40 billion to join the fight.\n\nDuring a Gold Rush, Sell the Shovels\n\nWhen so much competition exists in a high-growth market, it can muddle the picture for investors. For example, thousands of companies went bankrupt during the internet craze, while only a few became dominant. How can investors parse through the noise?\n\n“During a gold rush, sell shovels.”\n\nSamuel Brannan became the first millionaire of the Gold Rush, but not for the reasons you might expect. Brannan capitalized on the frenzy by providing miners with shovels, picks, and pans.\n\nWhen oil fracking exploded a handful of years ago, an unexpected industry took off: RV makers, because fracking took place in remote locations with little housing, companies like Winnebago Industries took off as oil companies filled the housing void using RVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nUtilities: An Underappreciated Group\n\nThe most well-known company selling the “shovels” to the AI gold rush is Nvidia. However, the utility/energy industry may have an even longer runway than many AI names. Picking winners will become more difficult as the number of competitors in the industry snowballs. That said, the one constant will be the need for energy production.\n\nFor example, Vista Energy, which offers electricity and power generation, is up 113.7% over the past year, trouncing the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 17.2% over the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, Constellation Energy holds a coveted Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and analysts see earnings growing by an explosive 551.72% next quarter!\n\nThe two stocks mentioned, and fellow industry leader NRG Energy are currently extended. However, they would provide solid reward-to-risk on a deeper pullback (to the 50-day moving average).\n\nBottom Line\n\nPicking winners in a hot industry like AI can be challenging as the competition is fierce. Nevertheless, the one constant is that the proliferation of AI will require a plethora of new energy production.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has popped 223% over the past year, catapulting the company to a $2.1 trillion valuation (only Apple and Microsoft are worth more). Nvidia makes powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center that are designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and the company is overwhelmed with demand.\n\nBut while investors are (understandably) laser-focused on Nvidia, they might be overlooking other opportunities in the chip sector. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS).\n\nHere's why following Wall Street's lead and buying shares of Micron and Axcelis might be an excellent idea.\n\n1. Micron Technology is a critical partner to Nvidia\n\nMicron is one of the world's largest producers of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are critical in everything from smartphones to data centers. As a result, the company's opportunity in the expanding AI space is already proving to be multifaceted.\n\nFirst, Micron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) solution was chosen by Nvidia to power its new H200 data center GPU, which is the successor to its industry-leading H100. Micron's HBM3E memory consumes 30% less power than competing hardware, which makes it an obvious choice as data center operators seek to keep costs down. Unsurprisingly, Micron's high-bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024, and most of its 2025 supply has been allocated already.\n\nSecond, AI workloads are quickly migrating from the data center to computers and devices instead, which creates a faster and more intuitive user experience. The chipsets inside AI-enabled computers are called neural processing units (NPUs), and they require 80% more DRAM capacity than traditional chips. Similarly, Micron expects DRAM content inside mobile devices to double. That translates to more demand and more revenue for the company.\n\nMicron's chips can already be found in Samsung's latest Galaxy S24 smartphone, which it also advertises as \"Galaxy AI.\" It features a chat assistant, translation assistant, and new camera technologies, all powered by AI.\n\nMicron stock is already up 47% in 2024 and is trading near an all-time high. Investors were very pleased with its breakout fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). For Q2, it delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, a 57% year-over-year jump. The company appears to have fully recovered from a challenging landscape last year, when it grappled with an oversupply of chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering Micron stock, and 27 have given it the highest possible buy rating. The company is forecasting an accelerated revenue growth rate of 76% in the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), so there could be more upside ahead for the shares.\n\n2. Axcelis is one of the cheapest stocks in the chip space\n\nAxcelis Technologies is often overlooked by investors because it doesn't actually produce any chips. Instead, it makes ion implantation equipment that is critical to the fabrication process. The Wall Street Journal tracks just eight analysts covering Axcelis stock, but the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating. It trades at a very attractive valuation right now, so investors might want to follow the Street's lead.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry is a significant source of demand for Axcelis, because it's the only ion implant company with complete coverage for power device applications. Power devices regulate electric power in workloads with high currents, and chemistries like silicon carbide can help manufacturers deliver hardware that is far more efficient. In EV applications, that leads to shorter charging times and much further battery range (mileage).\n\nAxcelis expects AI to become an increasingly important source of demand, too. As I touched on in the section about Micron, AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity than traditional computing workloads, and that means more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive chips.\n\nAxcelis generated $1.13 billion in revenue in 2023, which was a 22.9% increase from 2022. Its earnings per share (profit) jumped by an even more impressive 36.1% to $7.43. But it gets better, because the company is currently sitting on an order backlog worth a whopping $1.2 billion, so 2024 could be another strong year.\n\nAxcelis stock is up 390% over the past five years, even after accounting for the recent 46% pullback from its all-time high. Based on the company's 2023 earnings and its current stock price of $104.32, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14. That's a 56% discount to the iShares Semiconductor ETF, which sports a P/E ratio of 32.3, implying Axcelis is far cheaper than its peers in the chip industry as a whole.\n\nBased on Wall Street's consensus price target of $156, Axcelis stock could soar 50% from where it trades today. However, it would have to more than double just to trade in line with the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Either way investors look at it, there is a very clear case for potential upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These Are the 3 Tech Stocks Billionaires Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Technology stocks have been in high demand over the past year or so, driving the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite to new heights. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to lead that charge higher.\n\nLike many investors, billionaires are intrigued by the potential to profit from these next-generation algorithms and have piled into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. Recent research by The Motley Fool shines a light on the most popular technology stocks held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to almost no one that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is near the top of the list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in facilitating AI processing, leading to triple-digit revenue and profit gains last year and headlines galore. What they might find surprising, however, is that two AI tech stocks are owned by more hedge funds, while another is neck and neck with Nvidia.\n\nLet's look at the three tech stocks -- not named Nvidia -- that are most widely held by billionaire hedge fund managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires' Favorite Tech Stocks\n\nResearchers at The Motley Fool examined 16 hedge funds that are run by billionaires to ascertain what some of the wealthiest investors had in their portfolios. The data was obtained by reviewing each of the funds' fourth-quarter 2023 13F forms -- the quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of each quarter. The report discloses their portfolio holdings.\n\nThe study then compiled a list of the technology stocks that appeared in the top-10 holdings of more than one of the hedge funds reviewed. And the results were telling.\n\nAlphabet: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). BlueCrest Capital Management (Michael Platt). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Soros Fund Management (George Soros). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company's dominant Google Search gives it access to a vast treasure trove of data, which is needed to adequately train generative AI models. Its search business also forms the foundation for its industry-leading, digital-advertising business, capturing roughly 30% of the market last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman, who is also a fan, detailed the reasoning behind Pershing Square Capital's large stake in Alphabet: \"We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model.\" He went on to cite the stock's compelling valuation -- which is still attractive -- currently trading at less than 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, making it one of the best bargains among AI tech stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META)(NASDAQ: GOOG) also topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Renaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company boasts the world's most widely used family of social media platforms. About 3.2 billion people visit one of its sites every day, and 4 billion stop by monthly. This provides the company with a large horde of data. Meta surprised tech aficionados by developing its own Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is now available for hire on all the major cloud platforms, representing an entirely new revenue stream.\n\nIts AI chops aside, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates recently addressed some of the market's most popular tech stocks, saying he views \"Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap.\" Dalio has a point, and that might help explain Meta's popularity among the billionaire set. Meta is currently selling for about 25 times forward earnings, a discount compared to a current multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft: A top-10 holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was tied with Nvidia, a top holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\n\nWhile Microsoft's software offerings and recurring revenue are no doubt appealing, the company has a big catalyst directly tied to AI -- namely, its generative AI-powered assistant, Copilot, a suite of helpers deeply integrated into the company's most popular products and services.\n\nCopilot streamlines a growing list of otherwise time-consuming tasks, helping users to be more productive. In fact, the initial versions were so successful Microsoft is rolling out a number of job-specific Copilots geared toward the sales, customer service, and finance industries, which will likely enjoy similar success.\n\nWe don't yet know how much this program will add to Microsoft's sales, but the numbers will likely be significant. Billionaire Dan Loeb of Third Points suggests the introduction of Copilot \"could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027.\n\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft isn't nearly as cheap as the other two stocks in our trio, but consider this: The company already has a clear path to profit from AI, which could be lucrative.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Continue to Soar in 2024: My Top 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before the Surge Continues",
        "content": "After enduring one of its worst performances since 2008, the Nasdaq Composite has turned things around, gaining 50% since the beginning of last year. After such a sharp move higher, some investors wonder if much upside remains.\n\nYet a review of the data suggests the current market rally still has room to run. Since the storied index began trading back in 1972, every year after a market recovery begins, the tech-heavy index has risen 19%, on average. The ongoing battle with inflation is a wild card that could still throw a wrench in the works. That said, history suggests that 2024 should be a profitable year for investors.\n\nIt's generally agreed that recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have helped fuel the market's ascent and will likely drive additional gains in 2024. While estimates vary, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years, according to data compiled by McKinsey Global Institute. Companies at the cutting edge of AI will enjoy a veritable windfall.\n\nHere are my top five AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq climbs to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion regarding the potential for AI would be complete without a nod to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) is the gold standard for several AI use cases, including machine learning, cloud computing, and data centers -- and its processors have quickly become the go-to for generative AI. Demand has far exceeded supply, with the resulting chip shortage expected to persist until 2025. Competition is fierce, but Nvidia's decades of experience and significant spending on research and development have kept its rivals at bay.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) grew 126% and 586%, respectively. While no one expects its triple-digit gains to continue indefinitely, demand is expected to remain strong. Furthermore, while 34 times forward earnings might seem pricey, its growth illustrates why Nvida is deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was another company that was quick to capitalize on the generative AI opportunity. After years of toiling behind the scenes, it took a $13 billion stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and rolled out its Copilot suite of AI assistants. Copilot is deeply integrated into Microsoft's core offerings, streamlining time-consuming tasks and making workers more productive. A survey of early users found that once they tried Copilot, 77% said they \"didn't want to give it up.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNew versions are still being introduced. While estimates vary, some analysts believe Copilot could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue annually, which will be a boon to the company. Furthermore, Microsoft's Azure Cloud is gaining market share and attributing its accelerating growth to AI. At 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling for a premium compared to a multiple of 27 for the S&P 500, but that's pretty reasonable considering Microsoft's potential.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has been laboring in the field for more than 20 years, supplying AI-fueled data analytics to governments and enterprises alike. When AI went viral last year, the company met the challenge head-on, introducing its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which layers generative AI onto its already robust offerings.\n\nPalantir offers \"boot camps\" to identify mission-critical issues it can solve with AIP, and demand has been off the charts. The company planned to host 500 sessions in one year and blew past the goal in just four months. As a result, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 70% year over year and 12% sequentially, making it the company's fastest-growing business, and it's only just getting started.\n\nPalantir's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\n4. Super Micro Computer\n\nIt isn't just chips and software that are fueling the AI revolution. Most AI processing happens on cloud or data center servers, and that's where Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, comes in. The company works closely with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and others to develop cutting-edge servers that can withstand the rigors of AI processing. These close ties ensure that Supermicro servers are optimized to be AI workhorses while also focusing on energy efficiency.\n\nDemand is strong and the company is taking market share from its rivals. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), revenue grew 103% year over year while its adjusted EPS jumped 71%. Yet despite its impressive growth, Supermicro is selling for less than 3 times forward sales, a bargain when considered in the light of its opportunity.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has a long history of deploying AI to boost its search and digital advertising businesses. The company quickly deployed generative AI functionality into its core Google and Android products. Furthermore, the company is well positioned to offer generative AI models to its cloud customers via Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider.\n\nOne of its biggest opportunities is Gemini, which the company says is its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Furthermore, Google's Vertex AI platform provides 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps without having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nRecent advancements in AI will likely help fuel the recovery in Google's digital advertising business, and at less than 27 times earnings, Alphabet stock is a steal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(0:45) - What Can We Learn From Generation Z Investing Trends? (5:40) - Stocks To Keep On Your Watchlist Right Now (37:00) - Episode Roundup: MSFT, NVDA, SG, RDDT, CEG, RIVN, HOOD Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #398 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is joined by Ethan Feller, Zacks Stocks Strategist, to talk about the next generation of investors, GenZ.\n\nThe oldest of GenZ are now approaching 30. They have been out in the work force for several years and many of them are now investing in stocks. This generation also came of age with financial apps like Robinhood on their phones already. They have embraced fintech.\n\nWhat Industries Are GenZ Investing In?\n\nNo one would be surprised to know that GenZ investors like technology and don’t like some of the old economy industries like fossil fuels. Tracey also hasn’t heard about them rushing into the bank stocks either.\n\nBut clean energy, especially nuclear, appears to be high on their list. And big tech, especially the Mag 7, even if those companies have been around for many decades, are also in the picture.\n\nSome stocks, like Tesla, which were popular with Millennials, appear to be out-of-favor with younger investors. Perhaps Rivian is more their steam?\n\nEvery generation also comes of age amidst a new restaurant brand. Baby Boomers had McDonald’s. GenX had Starbucks. Millennials had Chipotle. What will it be for GenZ?\n\n5 Stocks GenZ May Have on their Short Lists\n\n1. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft went IPO in 1986, well before GenZ was even born. It isn’t exactly a “new” technology company. But it has its hands in many areas, including generative AI thanks to its investment in OpenAI.\n\nShares of Microsoft are up 7.8% year-to-date after pulling back from recent all-time highs. GenZ likes companies that pay dividends, and Microsoft pays one, currently yielding 0.7%.\n\nAre you surprised GenZers are interested in owning Microsoft?\n\n2. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is the leader in AI chips in 2024 but prior to AI, it was the leader in gaming. Is it any surprise, then, that GenZ wants to own NVIDIA?\n\nShares of NVIDIA are up 70.7% year-to-date but have pulled back off their all-time highs over the last month, falling 3.8% in that period. NVIDIA also pays a dividend, currently yielding just 0.02%. It’s just $0.16 a share so investors aren’t really owning it for the yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA may seem expensive, but it’s trading at just 35x forward earnings.\n\nIs NVIDIA a “generational” must-own stock for GenZ?\n\n3. Sweetgreen, Inc. (SG)\n\nSweetgreen is a fast-growing restaurant chain that is popular with GenZ and Millennial consumers as it serves healthy food. Sweetgreen shares have taken off in 2024, rising 84% year-to-date. But over the last month, shares have pulled back by 6.3%.\n\nSweetgreen is still a small cap company, with a market cap of just $2.4 billion.\n\nWill Sweetgreen be GenZ’s generational restaurant chain, like McDonald’s was for the Baby Boomers?\n\n4. Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG)\n\nConstellation Energy is a leading provider of nuclear energy in the United States. It has a market cap of $58.4 billion. GenZ is very interested in clean energy companies. Additionally, Constellation Energy pays a dividend, which GenZ loves. It’s currently yielding 0.8%.\n\nShares of Constellation Energy are up 57% year-to-date. It still has an attractive PEG ratio, however, of 0.9. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both growth and value.\n\nShould Constellation Energy be on your short list?\n\n5. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN)\n\nRivian manufactures electric vehicles. GenZ has come of age with EVs like Tesla being common place. Why not invest in it?\n\nShares of Rivian have plunged this year as sales of EV cars and trucks have slowed. Rivian recently announced another round of layoffs. Shares are down 62.3% year-to-date. But earnings are still expected to rise 19.3% this year.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Rivian?\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About the GenZ’s Favorite Stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Sell in May and Go Away? 3 Overvalued Stocks to Dump Now",
        "content": "As we zoom right past the midpoint of April, the “sell and May and go away” phrase will hit the headlines again, as it typically does almost every year, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, there is no shortage of things to be uneasy about this May.\n\nThe broader stock market seems to have been running on empty since the second quarter began. And with interest rate cuts that may be delayed (perhaps into 2025?) at the hands of inflation, May 2024 certainly seems like an opportune time for investors to take some profit off the table.\n\nUndoubtedly, taking a bit of profit off the table of some seemingly frothy winners can never hurt unless we’re talking about ditching the class of winning stocks that have continued to win in recent years. Of such names, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) immediately comes to mind as one of those winners that sellers may have gotten completely wrong in recent years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn any case, here are three overvalued stocks to sell as May rolls around.\n\nLululemon (LULU) the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wall\n\nSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, we have fallen athleisure firm Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), which has added to its losses since reporting some pretty dismal quarterly earnings results a few weeks ago. Today, the stock is around 33% from its January all-time high. Back then, it seemed like the sky was the limit as the firm sought to expand internationally while continuing to command premium prices in a rather mixed-to-muted consumer climate.\n\nUndoubtedly, Lululemon has been the hot growth play in apparel in recent years. Can one dud of a quarter really change the investment thesis?\n\nPossibly. Consumers may have felt some of the macro headwinds, but the biggest takeaway from LULU stock’s latest downfall was how quickly and unpredictably fashion trends can shift in the near term.\n\nThe big question remains whether trends will shift back in Lululemon’s favor in a timely manner. It will certainly be tough for Lululemon to bounce back down the stretch, even if it boasts one of the most robust brands in apparel.\n\nEven if there’s a turning of the tides on the horizon, I’m not sure it’ll arrive this year. Not while competition in yoga kicks things up a notch, others ditch athleisure for other wear, like denim.\n\nThe lower guidance may be baked in here at $344 and change, but the 28.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple remains still too lofty for me until the firm can deliver a big growth surprise.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a computer-aided design (CAD) software developer who’s ripe to cash in on the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Undoubtedly, CAD tools require quite a bit of training. With an AI copilot, though, professional users can allocate more time to design and less time learning the ropes. The AI story seems incredibly sound, but the stock has struggled to sustain any traction in recent years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest setback struck Wednesday, with shares recently nosediving nearly 6% in a day following an announcement that the firm will delay releasing its annual report due to an accounting probe.\n\nOnly time will tell what the extent of the accounting situation is. Regardless, one can’t help but feel a great sense of uncertainty with the name right now. Until the air clears on the matter, I’m in no rush to buy the stock, not while it’s trading for 51.1 times trailing P/E, a multiple I find quite rich.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of companies with much to gain from generative AI tools, we have Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). I won’t be the first to admit that Photoshop and Illustrator can be rather challenging to master. As the company invests a great deal in generative AI, we may all be Photoshop wizards without years of expertise. As exciting as Adobe’s AI-powered future stands, the stock has not been off to the races; it’s been plunging.\n\nIndeed, AI stands to make Adobe’s suite a heck of a lot better. But it also opens the door to potential industry rivals hungry to innovate in AI-powered image and video generation. I have viewed Adobe’s creative suite as having a virtually impenetrable moat for years. Now that firms are leveraging disruptive generative AI technologies, I’m no longer sure how wide that moat is anymore. And in a few years, I have no idea what’s to become of it.\n\nThe company recently released AI tools to its Premier Pro video-editing software. While these tools are worthy additions to the suite, I can’t help but wonder what Adobe’s rivals are doing and whether they can one-up Adobe in certain areas.\n\nIn any case, I’m steering clear of ADBE stock after its 25% plunge off 52-week highs. At 45.3 times trailing P/E, the stock is too expensive, in my opinion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Identifying the next growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 is a noteworthy endeavor. The Magnificent 7 refers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have dominated the technology sector for years.\n\nThese mega-cap companies have delivered extraordinary returns, shaping the market and our daily lives. However, as with all empires, some continue to rise and others fall causing a shift in dominance. While these growth stocks listed above aren’t necessarily losing their mojo, a few could be replaced with Wall Street’s next generation of favorites.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is undoubtedly one of the top prospects to become a Magnificent 7 killer over the next decade. The company is at the forefront of the AI revolution, set to deliver superior returns and capital to shareholders.\n\nBroadcom is a titan in the semiconductor industry, with diverse product offerings serving the data center, network, broadband, wireless and industrial markets. They power everything from smartphones to IoT devices. With the growing demand for connectivity and cloud offerings, Broadcom stands tall as a major beneficiary. However, investors are most excited about the company’s AI tailwinds, which are set to accelerate revenue, EPS and FCF from operations. Its customer silicon chip for AI workloads continues to see unprecedented demand, as hyperscalers ramp up its product offerings. Additionally, Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware in 2023 further solidifies its position in the enterprise software market. That makes Broadcom one of the best growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 stocks for years to come.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to showcase its ability to weather storms and emerge as a leading contender for the top growth stocks to challenge the Magnificent 7. The company underwent major restructuring in 2023, and its new business model and cost-cutting efforts have proven material.\n\nNetflix took serious measures to improve many aspects of their business. Firstly, the company cut costs by $300 million in 2023. Secondly, it finally started to crack down on password sharing, which had been a huge crutch to the business. Moreover, its new ad plan membership was a genius move, boosting its global subscribers while allowing the company to appeal to a wider audience. In FY23, Netflix saw record revenue, earnings and FCF. Net earnings increased 21% YOY to $12.03 per share, with FCF up 328% to a record $6.92 billion. The company is not shying away from the competition in streaming, aiming to unlock new revenue growth opportunities in live gaming and sports-adjacent programming. Netflix’s new strategy is working, and investors should not ignore its margin expansion capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the best sleeper AI stocks with incredible long-term potential. Its expansive suite of creative software, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat, is leading the generative AI boom.\n\nAdobe’s tools are indispensable for graphic designers, photographers, videographers and creative professionals. Its transition to a subscription-based model has proven invaluable, ensuring recurring revenue streams while building a loyal customer base. However, the major catalyst for growth is Adobe Sensei GenAI, a co-pilot software to accelerate productivity and design all in one suite. It is well-equipped with market automation, analytics, testing and other AI intelligence to drive outcomes for its customers. The platform continues to gain traction, and its FY23 results only showcased a sliver of its potential. With the profitability and cash flows to drive long-term growth, Adobe remains one of the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Thursday, April 18, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA has literally emerged as the market's collective play on the outlook for artificial intelligence; the stock is up +72.7% this year vs. +7.8% for the Zacks Tech sector and +5.6% for the S&P 500 index. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for GPU’s have resulted in the company’s stocks skyrocketing. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, while it is also leaving giant imprints on the Gaming and ProViz end markets.\n\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nAlphabet shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the last six months (+12.9% vs. +14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Alphabet’s sluggish network advertisement business have been casting a cloud over its prospects. Also, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\n\nYet, expanding data centers, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities and deepening focus on the wearables category remain major tailwinds. The company’s efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry as well as autonomous driving space also gives cause for optimism.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-10.9% vs. +15.6%). Per the Zacks analyst, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue to ail. The company faces the upcoming patent expiration of Stelara. Though it has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, uncertainty regarding the talc litigations persists.\n\nHowever, its Innovative Medicine Unit is outdoing the markets currently, and the MedTech unit is is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products. J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.\n\nStory continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

The innovations like Citation CJ3 Gen2 business jet and Liberty LSV prove fruitful.\n\nBroadridge Gains From Itiviti Buyout Amid High Competition\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, the Itiviti acquisition has boosted Broadridge's global technology and operations segment. High competition from other players is an overhang.\n\nAspen (AZPN) to Benefit From Demand for Product Portfolio \r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Aspen's performance is gaining from demand for its products across most of the end markets.

        "title": "7 Must-Have AI Stocks, Fed Rate Cuts or No Fed Rate Cuts",
        "content": "Markets have remained strong in 2024 primarily because of two factors: the emergence of AI stocks and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts this year.\n\nHowever, inflation remains high while other economic signals indicate a strong economy overall. The result is that the Fed can wait to cut rates. In fact, it may. The timeline continues to be pushed back with some pundits suggesting that there may be zero rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThat leads me to believe that investors will redirect their optimism into AI stocks. Those shares will not have the benefit of immediately lower lending rates, however, they benefit from optimism. That optimism suggests that AI is only beginning as a long-term opportunity that will fundamentally change the economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are likely to refocus on the benefits of AI as Fed rate cut hopes dwindle. That should spike demand and prices.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent stock correction is likely to be an opportunity for multiple reasons. First of all, it’s not very serious, and more likely a reflection of current headwinds overall.\n\nThose headwinds include factors like later than expected rate cuts and increased competition from rivals including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nLet’s focus on the latter part of those two factors. Intel just released its latest AI chip called Gaudi 3. Intel claims that the chip is faster and more efficient than Nvidia’s leading H100 chips. It very well may be but the problem is going to be sales. It will be very difficult for Intel and other chip makers to disrupt Nvidia’s dominance. Nvidia did not become the most coveted chip maker by chance. Further, Nvidia is scheduled to release its h200 GPU chips this quarter. Those chips are likely to be superior to Intel’s Gaudi 3 chips. Beyond that, Nvidia is by far the better stock given how successful the company has been in turning AI into earnings. Those earnings jumped by 486% in the December quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has performed exceptionally well over the past year and rebounded very strongly. The company was among the biggest losers during the quantitative tightening era between late 2021 and late 2022.\n\nHowever, Meta Platforms has rebounded. That rebound can be partially attributed to its investment in its Llama AI platform. To be clear, the majority of the rebound is due to the return of advertising revenues that underpin Meta Platform’s business model.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese days, Meta Platforms’ Llama AI model is gaining steam. The firm is set to release Llama 3, the newest iteration of its large language model (LLM). Meta is releasing Llama 3 likely within the next month.\n\nLlama 3 has the potential to be revolutionary. Meta says that the upgrade will be capable of reasoning and planning. That suggests AI is becoming more human overall and  utilitarian. In turn, Meta should be able to better monetize AI, improving its stock as a result. This makes it one of those AI stocks to consider.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) AI prowess and profitability are a potent mix. Again, I believe investors are likely to refocus their capital into AI stocks as the Fed rate cut timeline extends.\n\nThe company is well noted for its AI platforms. Palantir’s ability therein has caused the stock to rise. Palantir is  deserving of the attention it has received due to its fundamental strength. The company has reported five straight quarters of GAAP profitability.\n\nInvestors should look to Palantir for its fundamental success. They should also note that Palantir is quickly shedding its public side reputation and becoming a more commercial, private side endeavor. Commercial revenues grew by 32% in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, government revenues, still high, grew by 11%. This makes it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) moving some of its foundry workloads to the latter firm. The partnership suggests that both Palantir and Oracle are deeply interested in western interests moving forward. The point here being that Palantir is the first choice in regard to that issue and AI.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) stock is very clearly poised to continue heading upward on AI tailwinds. The company is gaining a lot of attention of late for its memory prowess. Its high bandwidth memory (HBM) has quickly become a vital component in the AI race.\n\nMicron was selected as a critical HBM supplier to Nvidia which is an excellent reason to   assume further growth will follow. High bandwidth memory is used to increase the power of AI chips. It is easy to see why Micron then has such a strong opportunity given its connection to Nvidia.\n\nMicron is also benefiting from the premiums associated with that relationship. The company announced that it plans to raise the prices on DRAM and SSD by 25%. Micron is already coming off a stronger than expected quarter and with its new found Nvidia Jr. moniker, is expected to rise much higher. The company should continue to look more attractive as a refocus on AI monetization re-emerges in the wake of recent Fed news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose slower than expected rate cuts should benefit AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock in the near term.  investors are well aware of the narrative that underpins investing in AMD: the company is the primary competitor of Nvidia for AI chips.\n\nAMD offers a balance of comparable chip specifications at much lower prices. It continues to beg the question: will Nvidia’s perceived dominance soon be perceived as greed? The answer is maybe.\n\nIf some sort of seismic shift occurs and tech firms suddenly switch to AMD chips then of course its shares will move much higher. For now, AMD is simply a strong alternative to Nvidia and the company with a huge opportunity ahead.\n\nCEO Lisa Su predicts massive growth in AI data center chip opportunities in the next few years.  AMD’s  chips are in demand for such applications. That is still the best reason to buy AMD even if the company does not surpass Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of a select few companies that doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts. It is of course also one of the strongest AI stocks overall. I do believe that there will be a refocus on AI as mentioned above. and I do believe that will benefit Microsoft.\n\nSo, let’s first talk about the initial claim that Microsoft doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts.  That’s true, one of the primary reasons firms are interested in rate cuts is that lower lending rates emerge following any cut. Lower lending rates spur investments in growth opportunities and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is exceptionally cash rich. So, the company can simply chase opportunities as it sees fit without having to rely on lenders.\n\nThat simple truth is yet another reason to consider investing in Microsoft at the moment. The company is of course one of the strongest AI competitors overall. Its investment in ChatGPT has paid off very well. The company does have some issues relating to monetizing its office suite of products but overall is exceptionally strong.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefits from the same operating cash flow strengths as Microsoft. The stock is similarly attractive for that reason. So, I won’t beat a dead horse and instead will focus on Amazon’s primary AI opportunity which is its cloud network, AWS.\n\nCloud computing has traditionally accounted for a major portion of Amazon’s business. However, demand slowed last year as corporate partners slowed their spending. Amazon is looking for ways to strengthen its AI prowess. The company recently invested an additional $2.75 billion into AI startup Anthropic. That raises its total investment to 4 billion  invested in additional 2.75 billion into AI startup anthropic. that raises its total investment to $4 billion overall. This helps to make it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude AI assistant rivals that of ChatGPT. It’s clear that Amazon hopes to mimic the success of Microsoft in that regard. Overall, Amazon is well positioned as the largest cloud provider. AI investment into cloud workloads is set to strengthen and will benefit Amazon overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 17 that we would need to see at least two months of \"cooling numbers\" before the Fed even considers to start cutting interest rates. He said many investors have been \"clinging\" to rate cut hopes but the economic activity, jobs market, M&A and IPO activity remains hot, giving the Fed no impetus to ease its monetary policy.\n\nCramer lamented that the market is \"ignoring\" the positives and instead continues to react to weak earnings reports posted by some companies including JB Hun and Prologis.  Jim Cramer added that while he would \"never ever fight\" his viewers who want to sell their stocks right now amid the current market pullback and declines, selling stocks when they are low is not his \"style.\"\n\nCramer said that some \"big picture negatives\" were also weighing the market down. The CNBC host said long-term interest rates were rising, commodity and oil prices were soaring before seeing a decline recently amid hopes that Israel won't react to Iran's missile attacks. However, Cramer said these \"green shoots\" are crushed by the bear quickly, leaving no room for positivity.\n\nA Market That \"Wants to Go Down\"\n\nJim Cramer said that this is a \"market that wants to go down\" and since major stocks like Apple and Tesla are no longer giving a push to the broader market like they did in the recent market, people might think it would make sense to sell out. But Cramer questioned the temptation to immediately sell out of the current market, saying it's never a good idea to sell everything at once.\n\nCramer's Charitable Trust is Selling Stocks\n\nJim Cramer revealed that his charitable trust kept selling stocks \"every day in the last four weeks.\" But Cramer said he didn’t sell his stocks on a decline. Instead, his charitable trust used a strategy called \"scaling out.\"\n\n\"As the stock went higher we sold some shares to raise some cash. If it ever comes back down we can always use that cash to scale back in.\"\n\nThe Fed Might Have \"Jumped the Gun\" Again\n\nCramer said he thinks the market might be seeing a \"short-term peak\" because the Fed might have \"jumped the gun\" even after indicating earlier in the year that there won't be any need for more rate hikes.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer Said He'd Keep Buying Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nCramer sounded agitated on Abbot's pullback despite posting a quarter that according to Cramer was \"terrific.\" Cramer said when he saw Abbot's stock getting \"annihilated\" despite strong numbers, he knew that market has gone \"too negative.\" Cramer said he bought more Abbot shares on the latest decline. ABT is one of the stocks Cramer is recommending in April. Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Some top stocks both hedge funds and Cramer love include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 4 that he likes HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK). Cramer said he had recommended the stock before and it “shot up” before coming down. Cramer said he’s surprised to see the stock price of HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) so low given the skyrocketing oil price.\n\n“I want you to buy High Peak, right here!” Cramer said.\n\nWasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also added HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK), an exploration & production (E&P) company that performs geological and geophysical services, petroleum engineering and drilling. HighPeak is focused on developing unconventional oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Midland Basin of Texas. We like that the company’s energy reserves contain fewer byproducts than typically found in the reserves of competitors. Prior to our purchase, the stock was down because HighPeak had taken on too much debt. Under the leadership of Jack Hightower, the new chairman and CEO, the company has raised equity—largely from the management team—and has refinanced the debt. Going forward, we think HighPeak is attractive as an independent company or as an acquisition target of a larger competitor. Our confidence in HighPeak is enhanced by Mr. Hightower’s track record of success in the E&P industry and his willingness to put his own money where his mouth is.”\n\n9. Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts about Texas-based Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM). He said Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) is a “good stock” and praised the company’s dividend yield. Cramer also said that Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) has got mineral rights which make it a suitable play in the current environment since according to Cramer we are in an “inflationary environment” when it comes to oil and minerals.\n\n“I think you’ve got a good one,” Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM).\n\nViper talked about guidance and other important updates during its earnings call in February:\n\n\"Our GRP acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter, clearly laid out the framework that we look for in large-scale M&A. First, it must be accretive on all relevant financial measures. Second, there must be high-quality, undeveloped inventory that supports our long-term growth profile and provides clear visibility to future development. And third, the acquisition must provide significant scale that results in a pro forma business that is both bigger and better. Separately, Viper also completed its conversion into a Delaware corporation during the fourth quarter. We believe this conversion has delivered increased governance rights for our shareholders and positions Viper to grow our business and fully highlight the advantaged nature of mineral and royalty ownership.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we’ve initiated production guidance for both Q1 and the full year. While Q1 is expected to the weakest quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the timing of large pads, we continue to see strong activity levels across our acreage position and expect significant growth to occur throughout the year with 20 — with Q4 2024 production expected to be at or above the high end of our guidance range. This continued production growth, along with our best-in-class cost structure, should enable Viper to continue to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders primarily through our base plus variable dividend.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer called CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) a “very strong stock” in a latest program on CNBC. He said “I love this” stock and recommended existing CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) investors to “stay long.” For those who don’t own the restaurant chain company stock, Cramer’s advice is to “consider” the stock.\n\nIn addition to CAVA, Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nEarlier in April, Jim Cramer called Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  has been a “horrendous” stock but said that it’s “about to go up.” Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are “about to have a chicken price explosion.”\n\nWhen asked why doesn’t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he’s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to lower chicken prices.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) .\n\nCiting expected profits from chicken and pork segment, Citi recently hiked its price target for Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to $62.\n\nJim Cramer also recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for long term.\n\n6. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nSolar energy tracking and optimization solutions company Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) is one of the latest stock recommendations of Jim Cramer. A questioner asked Cramer about a recent analyst downgrade for Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT). Cramer said that he “read that downgrade” and believes it was just “someone trying to create a little noise.”\n\nJim Cramer thinks Nextracker Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NXT) “story” is good and said he’d be a buyer of the stock “right here at $52”. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) shares have pulled back since and as of April 15 morning the stock was trading at around $47.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Beat Nvidia in the Coming Decades",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has enjoyed a remarkable artificial intelligence (AI)-related surge since the beginning of 2023, and that's not surprising as the company is providing the critical building blocks needed for the proliferation of this technology.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are helping its customers train AI models and deploy them, which explains why there is a huge demand for its chips. As a result, Nvidia's revenue and earnings have been growing rapidly in recent quarters, and the good part is that the company could sustain its impressive momentum as more AI infrastructure is built.\n\nHowever, concerns are that an eventual slowdown in AI chip demand could negatively weigh on Nvidia's prospects in the long run. That's why investors should consider buying shares of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- both Nvidia customers -- as these two companies could turn out to be bigger AI beneficiaries than Nvidia decades from now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nJust like Nvidia, Microsoft has been one of the pioneers in the field of AI thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This partnership has placed Microsoft at the forefront of the AI revolution in multiple fast-growing markets.\n\nFrom workplace collaboration software to personal computers (PCs) to cloud computing, Microsoft has been integrating OpenAI's expertise in multiple areas to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, Microsoft's Azure cloud business is now growing at a faster pace thanks to the improving adoption of the company's AI-focused tools, which allow customers to use its platform to build and deploy generative AI solutions.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that out of Microsoft's 53,000-strong Azure AI customer base, a third started using its services in 2023. Additionally, Microsoft management pointed out on the company's January earnings conference call that its Azure cloud business got a boost of 6 percentage points because of AI, clocking year-over-year growth of 30%.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Microsoft's cloud business gaining more traction. That's because its customers can gain access to multiple large language models (LLMs) to build their AI applications without having to invest in expensive hardware. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud AI market could generate close to $650 billion in revenue by 2030. That's bigger than the $305 billion revenue that the AI chip market is forecast to generate at the end of the decade, indicating that Microsoft is sitting on a much bigger AI opportunity than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, however, is just one of the many AI-related catalysts for Microsoft. For instance, the adoption of AI-enabled PCs could give Microsoft's growth a big boost in the future. According to market research firm Canalys, shipments of AI-capable PCs are expected to increase at an annual rate of 44% through 2028, hitting 205 million units at the end of the forecast period.\n\nMicrosoft is looking to capitalize on this opportunity with Copilot Pro, a subscription service priced at $20 a month that will give PC users access to AI tools in multiple applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint, enabling them to create images with generative AI prompts and gain priority access to popular LLMs. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the market for specialized generative AI assistants could be worth $89 billion in 2032 as compared to just $447 million in 2022, which means that Microsoft's move to monetize its Copilot could help the company reap rich rewards.\n\nSo, even though Microsoft may not be matching Nvidia's stellar growth rate right now, it seems capable of delivering steady growth for a long time to come thanks to the growing AI adoption in multiple end markets that could turn out to be more lucrative than the AI chip space.\n\nThe good part is that Microsoft's growth rate is picking up nicely following the advent of AI. That's why investors will do well to buy this stock as it is trading at a reasonable 38 times trailing earnings right now compared to Nvidia's rich price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nDigital advertising is another industry that's expected to benefit from AI adoption, with advertisers using the technology to improve audience targeting so that they can enhance their returns on ad dollars spent. Bloomberg is forecasting generative AI-based ad spending to jump to $192 billion in 2032 from only $57 million in 2022.\n\nMeta Platforms is a top way to play this opportunity thanks to the growing popularity of the company's AI-focused tools and a huge user base. The company has been rolling out generative AI features for advertisers since last year and is claiming that they are driving solid improvements in advertisers' returns.\n\nMore importantly, the company is looking to push the envelope with new initiatives such as deploying its Meta AI chatbot to popular platforms such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which will bring its AI tools to a much larger user base. Meta AI is a generative AI assistant that answers users' queries and also allows them to create images with text prompts. Given that Meta ended 2023 with almost 4 billion monthly active users across its various apps, the company is sitting on a terrific monetization opportunity.\n\nAll this explains why consensus estimates are predicting an acceleration in Meta's earnings growth to an annual rate of 26% over the next five years as compared to 10% a year in the previous five years. Meta can sustain such healthy earnings growth for a longer period considering the multibillion-dollar opportunities in digital advertising and generative AI assistants.\n\nThis is precisely the reason why buying Meta Platforms stock is a no-brainer right now. It is trading at just 25 times forward earnings as compared to a trailing P/E ratio of 35, which points toward robust bottom-line growth. Also, this AI stock is cheaper than the likes of Nvidia and is trading at a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward P/E ratio of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), giving investors all the more reason to buy Meta Platforms as AI could send this stock soaring for a long time to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 15, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

        "title": "15 Best Low Cost ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used an ETF screener and filtered out funds with an annual expense ratio of 0.10% and under. We got 44 ETFs which were listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. Then, we manually checked the share price performance for the resultant funds and chose the top 15. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of April 15, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. It is important to note, however, that not all ETFs have been trading for 5 years. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 15 Best Low Cost ETFs\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Low Cost ETFs\n\n15. Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 15.60%\n\nThe Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS) ranks 15th on our list of the best low cost ETFs. It focuses on investing in companies with a combination of high trailing and future free cash flow yields, which also have a track record of increasing dividends. The fund seeks to mirror the performance of the Kelly US Cash Flow Dividend Leaders Index. Launched on September 13, 2023, the ETF manages assets amounting to $16.05 million as of April 12, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.00%. Its portfolio consists of 55 stocks.\n\nFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is one of the largest holdings of the Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS). The company offers e-commerce, transportation, and business services in the US and globally. On March 21, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $3.86, beating estimates by $0.38, and a revenue of $21.7 billion, falling short of estimates by $380 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 70 hedge funds were bullish on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), compared to 67 funds in the previous quarter. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust held the largest position in the company, comprising 1.53 million shares valued at $388.15 million.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is one of the best stocks to monitor.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other Q4 laggards were global reinsurer Arch Capital and shipping company FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)—holdings that pulled back following large gains. Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism. Although the demand environment remains challenging globally, particularly in the Express segment, the company is delivering solid earnings growth driven by cost savings initiatives. FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”\n\n14. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 31.15%\n\nNext on our list of the best low cost ETFs is the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR), which aims to reflect the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which includes small-cap US stocks.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\n\n10.

(NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”\n\n8. iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 68.58%\n\niShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) aims to reflect the performance of the S&P Total Market Index, which includes a range of American stocks from large to small companies.

        "content": "The share price of Nvidia has fallen.  (Igor Golovnov)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock fell 4% last night after a sell-off of global chip stocks and US technology firms.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell by over 180 points on Wednesday after the sector was hit by concerns about the Federal Reserve pushing back interest rate cuts, as well as China’s weak economy.\n\nCustomers are holding off on buying as they work through stockpiles, however, China’s buying of less-sophisticated machines has held up amid US restrictions on its access to high-tech equipment.\n\nIt came as ASML (ASML), the largest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, missed sales forecasts, which sent shares lower.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks rise as positive corporate results offset drop in European electric car sales\n\nTSMC (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has revealed a better-than-projected revenue outlook amid rising demand for AI-related products.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaking company, whose clients include Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), stuck with plans to spend as much as $32bn (£25.66bn) in 2024.\n\nTSMC has gained about $340bn of market value since an October 2022 trough, riding bets it will become a top winner of a global boom in AI development. It posted a better-than-expected rise of 9% in net income to NT$225.5bn ($7bn) for the March quarter.\n\n“Looking at 2024 as a whole, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand,” Wei told analysts on a conference call.\n\nLaster this month, TSMC also said it would build a third semiconductor factory in Arizona, raising its total investment in the United States to $65bn.\n\nIt already had plans to build two plants in Arizona, and another one in Germany.\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nEasyJet shares climbed more than 3% on Thursday as it narrowed its losses despite losing revenue from cancelled flights to Israel and Jordan last winter.\n\nThe budget airline took a £40m hit from the Middle East conflict but still managed to trim losses for the six months to the end of March by over £50m, to between £340m and £360m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was against losses of £411m a year earlier, and comes alongside an increase of 18% in fuel costs, adding 6% inflation per seat.\n\nIt also benefitted from the early timing of Easter this year, which led to more demand for flights during March.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price falls ahead of halving as ETF inflows slow\n\n\"The importance that consumers place on travel coupled with easyJet’s trusted brand has driven good demand for our flights and holidays. Our growth and focus on productivity have reduced winter losses by more than £50m,\" Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, said.\n\n“We have further enhanced our network with the launch of new bases in Alicante and Birmingham providing greater choice for consumers across Europe.\"\n\nBetween October and March, passengers numbers rose 8% year-on-year, while average fares paid increased 9%.\n\nNokia (NOKIA.HE)\n\nNokia reported a smaller-than-expected profit on Thursday, with a double-digit fall in sales in the first quarter. This was due to a market weakened by a lack of clients investing in 5G technology.\n\nThe Finland-based firm reported a net profit of €501m (£429m, $535m) for the January to March period, up 46% from €342m the previous year. The figure was still lower than analysts had expected.\n\nOne-off gains from Nokia’s licensing business contributed to the profit, it revealed.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders was €497m, up from from €332m a year earlier. However, Nokia’s sales were down 20% at €4.7bn.\n\nSales at the network Infrastructure division fell 26%, measured in local currencies as well as net.\n\nThe company reiterated its outlook given in January for a comparable operating profit in 2024 of between €2.3bn and €2.9bn.\n\nIn a note to clients, JP Morgan analysts said Nokia's weak sales trends caused the earnings miss, but added the company is well positioned for a recovery.\n\nWatch: How does inflation affect interest rates?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has proven its ability to drive growth for investors' portfolios. It soared to $3 trillion in market value back in 2021, and after a slump over the past couple of years, it's once again on the rise. As investors look ahead to the possibility of lower interest rates and a stronger economy, they're returning to growth investments like crypto.\n\nBut if you prefer to stick with the stock market, don't worry -- you won't miss out on major growth opportunities. In fact, certain stocks have even more potential than any crypto right now. You'll find many of them in another hot growth area: the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI market is forecast to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and today, investors are positioning their portfolios to benefit. Let's take a closer look at three AI stocks that could beat any crypto player. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares already have soared in the triple digits over the past year, but this top AI stock still may have plenty of room to run. Here's why. Nvidia is the AI chip market leader, with 80% share, and it's likely to maintain this leadership thanks to its brand strength and constant innovation.\n\nCompanies know they can count on Nvidia, making it their go-to destination, so if Nvidia can keep ahead of rivals from a technology perspective it's likely to win. For example, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk recently said, \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI.\" This comment was in conjunction with Nvidia's announcement of its Blackwell architecture, featuring a number of innovations including the most powerful AI chip yet.\n\nThis upcoming launch, along with Nvidia's increasing spending on research and development, are reasons to be confident about the company's earnings potential. And speaking of earnings, Nvidia's dominance so far helped it report triple-digit gains in revenue and net income last year.\n\nAll of this means the stock looks like a great buy at 34 times forward earnings estimates and has plenty of fuel to advance over time.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nYou probably know Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) best thanks to its biggest revenue driver: Google Search. Advertisers pay to promote their products or services across the search platform, knowing they can easily reach their audience there. After all, Google Search consistently holds more than 90% of the global search market.\n\nThanks to AI, Google Search is likely to get better and better -- and AI tools are making the advertising experience easier for advertisers too. Alphabet recently launched its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 1.5, and is applying the technology across its business. In search, generative AI is offering users faster results and access to more information on a specific topic. This should keep users coming back, and as a result, advertisers are likely to keep spending on Google Search ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also could become an AI winner through its cloud business. Google Cloud offers clients access to AI chips and other products and services to power their AI projects. Just last year, it announced thousands of product advancements thanks to AI, and all of this helped Google Cloud win or expand deals with major companies including McDonald's and Verizon.\n\nRight now, Alphabet stock trades for 23 times forward earnings estimates, a terrific entry point for this solid long-term player.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another company that generates most of its revenue through advertising. Advertisers flock to Meta's social media platforms -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- because they know that's where they can reach us. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every day.\n\nThis has offered Meta a growing stream of revenue, which has led to profit too. Now, Meta is going all in on AI, with the plan of using this technology across all of its products and services well into the future. Meta's made AI its investment focus, with the goal of having 600,000 graphics processing units on board by the end of the year.\n\nMeta already has developed its own large language model (LLM), Llama, and is now training Llama 3. This serves as the foundation for products such as new conversational assistant Meta AI -- and thanks to Meta's open-source policy, its software could even become an industry standard.\n\nThis tech giant has huge AI ambitions, and if it even reaches only some of its goals, it could be a major AI winner -- that's why it looks like a top bargain now at 24 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Members of Congress Generated Triple-Digit Returns in the Stock Market Last Year: These Are the 3 Stocks They Bought",
        "content": "Warren Buffett's investment return in 2023 was around 15%. That's how much his Berkshire Hathaway stock increased. But the legendary investor didn't come close to matching the performance of a handful of elected representatives on Capitol Hill.\n\nFour members of Congress generated triple-digit returns in the stock market last year. These are the three key stocks they bought.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nRep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., saw his investments skyrocket by nearly 239% in 2023. That return made him by far the biggest stock-trading winner in Congress. Rep. David Rouzer (R-N.C.) ranked at No. 4 with a return of nearly 106%. These two congressmen invested in the same stock: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNeither Higgins nor Rouzer actually bought shares of Nvidia last year, though. They didn't invest in any other stock either. They both initiated positions in Nvidia in 2021 and haven't sold their shares since. Nvidia is the only stock in Higgins' portfolio.\n\nNvidia was a great stock to own in 2023. Shares of the chipmaker soared thanks to the surging interest in generative AI. Nvidia couldn't produce enough AI chips to keep up with the tremendous demand.\n\n2. NGL Energy Partners\n\nRep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) was the second-most successful stock investor in the U.S. Congress last year. The Tennessee Republican's total return topped 122%.\n\nGreen sold shares of pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP throughout much of 2023. However, he loaded up on another energy stock -- NGL Energy Partners LP(NYSE: NGL). The congressman also bought shares of NGL Energy Partners in 2022.\n\nNGL Energy Partners stock zoomed 360% higher last year. Over the previous seven years, though, the midstream energy stock plunged to roughly 97% below its high. NGL Energy's earnings outlook improved considerably, prompting some investors (including Green) to pile back into the stock.\n\n3. Coinbase Global\n\nRep. Garret Graves (R-La.) took the No. 3 spot among congressional stock investors last year. Graves achieved a return of nearly 108%.\n\nThe Louisiana congressman's gains came from one stock. Graves bought 8,000 shares of Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN) in September 2022 and held them throughout 2023.\n\nCoinbase Global operates a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Its shares plummeted in 2022. However, Coinbase benefited as cryptocurrencies returned to favor in 2023. So did Rep. Graves.\n\nBut while Graves made a triple-digit return last year thanks to Coinbase, he might have a hard time repeating that performance in 2024. The GOP congressman sold all of his stake in Coinbase earlier this year and hasn't reported any other stock trades so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nCan these congressional stock picks keep soaring?\n\nAll three of these top stocks of the top congressional investors of last year have continued to rise in 2024. Nvidia has been the biggest year-to-date winner with its shares jumping more than 70%.\n\nHowever, valuation could become an issue with Coinbase and Nvidia. Coinbase trades at a whopping 83.3 times forward earnings. Nvidia's forward earnings multiple is 35.7. Meanwhile, NGL Energy's momentum has slowed considerably. The company also reported year-over-year revenue and earnings declines in its quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nNvidia, NGL Energy Partners, and Coinbase Global could keep soaring. However, I think investors -- including those in the U.S. Congress -- can find stocks to buy in 2024 with even better growth prospects.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coinbase Global wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Between 115% and 127% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "For more than a year, no investment trend on Wall Street has captivated investors' attention quite like artificial intelligence (AI). Utilizing software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to learn over time without human intervention in order to become more proficient at their tasks, gives AI a use case in almost every sector and industry.\n\nAlthough dozens of stocks have benefited from the investing euphoria associated with AI, no company has enjoyed a more direct boost to its sales and profits than semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has taken the AI movement by storm\n\nNvidia's infrastructure has quickly become the \"brains\" that power AI-accelerated data centers. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are in exceptionally high demand, with the latter responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nFurther, Nvidia finds itself in an enviable position where demand for its GPUs has completely overwhelmed supply. When the supply of an in-demand good is limited, the price of that good will rise until demand tapers. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), most of the 217% sales growth Nvidia recognized from its data center segment was the result of substantially higher prices on its top-tier GPUs.\n\nThere's also plenty of excitement following the introduction of its next-generation GPU, known as Blackwell. This new GPU promises accelerated computing capabilities that can power everything from generative AI solutions to quantum computing.\n\nThe near-term catalysts for Nvidia have been tangible -- and this isn't a fact that's lost on Wall Street. Analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt holds the Street's highest price target on Nvidia at $1,400 per share. If accurate, Mosesmann's lofty price target implies nearly 59% upside.\n\nBut there are a number of headwinds Nvidia is also contending with. For instance, upping its own production will reduce GPU scarcity and cannibalize its pricing power over time. Further, its top four customers are all developing their own in-house GPUs, which probably means we're witnessing a peak in orders from these \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents.\n\nDespite Mosesmann's cheery forecast for Nvidia, three other AI stocks offer considerably more upside, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBaidu: Implied upside of 115%\n\nThe first AI stock that could effectively double up Nvidia's returns, at least based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang has, on a couple of occasions, reiterated their price target of $210 for shares of Baidu. Based on its $97.54 closing price on April 12, this suggests up to 115% upside awaits.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the lures of Baidu from an investment standpoint is that it has a foundational operating model that would continue generating boatloads of operating cash flow if and when the AI bubbles bursts. Historically speaking, every next-big-thing investment over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble, and AI is unlikely to break this trend.\n\nBaidu's cash-cow segment is its internet search engine. In March, Baidu's search engine gobbled up a 60.44% market share in China, according to data from GlobalStats. Looking back over the last nine years, it's predominantly maintained between a 60% and 85% share of domestic internet search in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. This makes Baidu the logical choice for merchants wanting to get their message in front of consumers.\n\nFor the time being, Baidu has two key AI drivers: its AI cloud segment and its intelligent driving unit. Baidu's AI Cloud is one of the four largest cloud infrastructure service platforms in China. Since enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early innings, this bodes well for sustained double-digit growth.\n\nMeanwhile, subsidiary Apollo Go is the most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service on the planet. As of Jan. 2, 2024, Apollo Go had surpassed 5 million autonomous rides since its inception.\n\nBaidu is flush with cash (over $28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments), and it's valued at a historically cheap 8 times forward-year earnings. Long story short, Jiang's price target isn't unreasonable.\n\nMobileye Global: Implied upside of 127%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that could run circles around Nvidia in the return department is the developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and various autonomous driving solutions, Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY). Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli believes shares of the company will head to $72, which would result in a 127% increase, relative to where shares closed on April 12.\n\nWhereas a significant percentage of Baidu's cash flow is insulated in the event that the AI bubble bursts, Mobileye is highly dependent on a strong U.S. economy and AI continuing to its drive sales growth.\n\nSince the company's ADAS and autonomous driving solutions are found in next-generation vehicles, and these vehicles are progressively becoming more reliant on technology, the health of the auto market is paramount to its success. Unfortunately for Mobileye Global, demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has been fading domestically, to the point where legacy titans like General Motors and Ford Motor Company have scaled back their EV production ramp.\n\nIf there are silver linings to be found, it's that Mobileye is profitable on a recurring basis, generating plenty of operating cash flow, and closed out 2023 with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. It has the capital to continue innovating in any economic climate, and it benefits from the fact that periods of growth in the U.S. and global economy last significantly longer than contractions and recessions.\n\nAlthough Mobileye Global looks to have a bright future, it has a long way to go if it's to grow into a $72-per-share valuation, which would represent a $58 billion market cap.\n\nSoundHound AI: Implied upside of 117%\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that has the ability to handily outpace Nvidia to the upside, based on the projections of one Wall Street analyst, is voice-recognition software company SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN). Last month, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria raised his price target on SoundHound to $9.50 per share, which currently implies upside of 117%, based on where shares of the company ended on April 12.\n\nThe excitement surrounding small-cap AI stock SoundHound really kicked in mid-February, which is when Form 13Fs were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nTraditionally, a 13F provides a detailed snapshot of what Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling in the latest quarter. But in this instance, Nvidia's 13F revealed that it had purchased 1,730,883 shares of SoundHound AI, worth about $3.67 million, during the December-ended quarter. When the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution is buying shares of a relatively unknown AI up-and-comer, you pay attention!\n\nQuite a few of the Magnificent Seven members have been investing aggressively in voice-driven AI assistants. This incudes Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Alphabet's Google Assistant, to name a few. During the fourth quarter, sales for SoundHound surged 80%, with full-year revenue jumping 47% to $45.9 million in 2023. Though SoundHound is still just scraping the tip of the iceberg in terms of voice-recognition potential, its sales growth looks to be accelerating.\n\nFor the time being, the lion's share of SoundHound's revenue can be traced to royalties earned when a vehicle, restaurant, or television utilizes its AI-driven voice-recognition software. Over time, the company anticipates subscriptions will account for a greater percentage of its sales, and more than likely provide a boost to its operating margin.\n\nBut in spite of its impressive sales growth, SoundHound AI still lost nearly $89 million last year and burned through $68.3 million in cash via its operations. In short, it's nowhere close to generating a profit. Until that happens, Luria's lofty price target is unlikely to be reached.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), one stock that is absolutely hard to ignore is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company almost single-handedly kicked off the AI revolution by developing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make AI possible. The results of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) help illustrate its uncontested success. Revenue of $61 billion soared 126% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 surged 586%.\n\nI have no doubts that Nvidia will continue to succeed, but others have doubts. The potential for cyclicality in the chip industry, a frothy valuation, and rising fears of competition have some investors looking for viable alternatives, and following the example of a successful money manager might provide ideas.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb made his bones as the CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. From seed capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb spun that into a financial empire worth $6.6 billion. He's made no secret about his feelings regarding AI, which he views as \"transformational,\" and believes a \"profound economic upheaval\" is under way. While there are many stocks that will reap the benefits of generative AI, a quick look at Third Point's holdings reveals three that have the Loeb seal of approval -- and none of them are named Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Microsoft -- 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) deserves at least partial credit for helping to spark the AI revolution by integrating AI across a wide range of its cloud and software offerings. There's perhaps no bigger potential opportunity for the company than that represented by Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of tools that help automate and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks, thereby boosting productivity. According to Microsoft, demand has been off the charts and users seem to love it.\n\nLoeb has been incredibly bullish and has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed about 9% of its position in Microsoft in Q4, even as the value of the position rose -- thanks in part to the stock's 19% gains during the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a modest premium at 34 times earnings, but the company has only just begun to reap the rewards of its AI strategy, and Loeb obviously believes it's worth every penny -- and so do I.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb has been a firm believer in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which he first invested in years ago. He provided insight into his thinking in early 2022. At the time, the company's market cap clocked in at $1.6 trillion, and Loeb opined that the company had $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He estimated that the e-commerce segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- its cloud infrastructure segment -- was worth another $1.5 trillion. For context, Amazon's current market cap is $1.9 trillion, so there's still significant upside ahead.\n\nLoeb believes the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of generative AI is that there will be \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" in order to tap the large language models that underpin AI -- including those offered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He called cloud services the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold'.\"\n\nLoeb also trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% but, like Microsoft, the total value of his stake actually rose, thanks to a 20% increase in Amazon's stock price in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times sales to close out 2023, Amazon was, and still is, attractively priced.\n\nArtificial Intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.2% of holdings\n\nLoeb's substantial position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is at least partially explained by the ongoing rebound in the digital advertising market, but the company also has a sizable opportunity when it comes to AI. Loeb initiated a position in Q3 and added to it in Q4. Meta has long employed AI to serve relevant content to its social media users and to more accurately target the advertising that provides the lion's share of its revenue.\n\nMore recently, Meta has unveiled the next generation of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available for hire on all the major cloud infrastructure services. While we don't yet know the significance of its impact on Meta's bottom line, it does represent a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nWhile Loeb has been mum about his rationale, Meta meets Loeb's criteria of investing in \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations.\" And, as the sun set on 2023, Meta Platforms stock was selling for just 24 times earnings, a discount to a multiple of 26 for the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

With bond yields climbing when stocks were already getting pricey, a key measure known as the equity risk premium is sounding alarm bells for some.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of global chip stocks and AI bellwether Nvidia Corp. have fallen together into a technical correction, showing moderation in the global equity market’s most conspicuous driver over the past year and a half.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Again Elon Wants His Money Back Bankers Hit With Millions in Breakup Fees for Ditching New Jobs\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and Nvidia dropped more than 3% each Wednesday, pushing them down more than 10% from record high levels reached in March.\n\nIn addition to concerns of the rallies becoming overheated, the sector has been hit by concerns over pushed back Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and China’s weak economy.\n\nDutch chipmaking equipment firm ASML Holding NV led Wednesday’s decline in the so-called SOX gauge after it posted disappointing orders for the latest quarter. Top customers are holding off as they work through stockpiles, though China’s buying of less-sophisticated machines has held up amid US restrictions on its access to high-tech equipment.\n\nEarnings due later Thursday from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry, will shed further light on the outlook for demand. Expectations have been raised since the company reported better-than-expected sales for the latest quarter.\n\nWhile optimism has been priced into some chip stocks, “we suspect the sector could rebound after TSMC’s numbers, which we think should be solid,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a Singapore-based strategist at Asymmetric Advisors. Still, there are concerns “about spending on mature nodes given the massive overcapacity being built in China.”\n\nTSMC’s American depositary receipts are down 6.8% from their March all-time high. The biggest drags on the SOX in its drop into correction have been Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp., which are down more than 20% each since the gauge’s March 7 peak.\n\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang and Youkyung Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading Premiums Are Rising, and Insurers Say Lawsuits Are to Blame A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk Amazon Expands Sales of Its Cashierless Tech, While Scaling Back Itself\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - Cadence Design Systems on Wednesday introduced the latest version of supercomputer based around a custom computing chip designed to speed up the creation of other computing chips and the software that will run on them.\n\nCadence makes software that Nvidia, Apple and many other companies use to design chips with billions of transistors, the tiny on-off switches that make computers work. That design process can take a year or more.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, whose software offerings are as important to its overall business as its chips, do not want to wait that long to start writing code for the chips.\n\nThe two upgraded systems Cadence introduced on Wednesday, called Palladium Z3 and Protium X3, create a virtual version of a chip to start writing software while waiting for the physical chip to come back from the factory. Such emulation has become a key reason tech companies can deliver products at a faster pace.\n\n\"These systems are no good without software,\" Cadence CEO Anirudh Devgan said in an interview with Reuters. \"The general public doesn't realize how critical these tools are to the design of all these electronics.\"\n\nCadence executives said Nvidia is already testing some of the new Cadence systems that can emulate chips twice as large as the previous generation of systems, which Nvidia used to design its just-announced Blackwell chips.\n\n\"Palladium is the only appliance that's more important to me than the refrigerator,\" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at an event in Santa Clara, California, announcing the new Cadence systems. \"It is the single most important appliance in my life. We are the largest installation of Palladiums anywhere.\"\n\nThe heart of Cadence's Palladium emulation systems is itself a custom computing chip that Cadence used its own tools to design. The chip is as large and complex as some of Nvidia's AI chips.\n\n\"For emulation you need to design your own chip, and we have a 10-year lead on anybody else who even attempts to design their own emulator,\" Devgan said.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Fifty dollars doesn’t go very far today—unless you’re looking for under-$50 stocks to buy now and round out your portfolio.\n\nAlthough inflation growth may be declining, the current cost of goods and services remains significantly higher than two years ago. This discrepancy exists because inflation indexes measure ongoing growth, not actual price differences, leading to persistently low consumer confidence despite apparently positive inflation statistics.\n\nAt the same time, high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are becoming prohibitively expensive for retail traders, particularly as market volatility and general frothiness surge. This is where stocks priced under $50 come into play. They’re generally cheap enough that a decent-sized share count is easy to accumulate. At the same time, each one is positioned for rapid growth due to specific favorable conditions and bullish momentum, paving the way for potential success. Take note – these under-$50 stocks won’t stay cheap for long.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf any under-$50 stock qualifies as the comeback story of the year, it’s Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). With a solid foundation of government contracts and an expanding corporate portfolio, the artificial intelligence and machine learning company finally escaped its mid-teens rangebound trading after a strong earnings report propelled shares up by 30% since January.\n\nThat report also marked its fifth consecutive profitable quarter, recording earnings of 8 cents per share and a 14% revenue increase from government contracts at year’s end. More notably, revenue from its commercial segment jumped by 36%. While past bearish sentiment often focused on its reliance on government contracts, Palantir’s successful expansion into the corporate sector now distinguishes it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the per-share price is well under $50, the stock has remained stubbornly within the $20 – $25 range, possibly as part of CEO Alex Karp’s beef with short sellers. But despite some stock price and valuation skepticism, Palantir’s long-term prospects remain unmatched across multiple sectors, including artificial intelligence and defense industry stocks.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: GigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy. breakthrough stocks. Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has experienced a turbulent ride in 2024, initially surging to nearly $45 per share following a solid earnings report, only to fall back to pre-earnings levels – standing out as an under-$50 stock to buy now the whole time, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe decline in post-earnings share price largely reflected investors taking profits rather than a significant critique of GigaCloud’s long-term potential. Trading at just 13x earnings, GigaCloud, often compared to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), distinguishes itself by serving B2B markets. Unlike Alibaba, GigaCloud is not just about product sourcing; it offers a comprehensive vendor management platform designed to handle cross-border payments and other complex aspects of global eCommerce that often challenge small businesses.\n\nThe small business market remains largely untapped, and GigaCloud’s solutions, including payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and warehouse storage, provide a unique value proposition. This integrated service package is particularly valuable for entrepreneurs who struggle to compete with larger entities like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As companies like Amazon continue to increase fees and fulfillment rates, SMBs looking to maintain independence will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nNews Corp (NWSA) News Corp. (NWSA_ Building front\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNews Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) may initially seem out of place among other under-$50 stocks due to its roots in legacy media—an industry not typically associated with high-flying prospects. Historically dependent on newspapers, books, and cable television, News Corp is distinguishing itself through a successful pivot to next-generation media formats.\n\nThis shift in News Corp’s strategy is partly driven by Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently snagged a significant stake in the company. Following this investment, News Corp reported a 3% increase in quarterly revenue year-over-year and a 94% boost in net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes these financial gains to the company’s strategic emphasis on digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the less predictable advertising revenue model.\n\nThis strategy mirrors that of many software-based under-$50 stocks, which favor recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For instance, News Corp is focusing on acquiring digital subscriptions rather than chasing high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) now offers Photoshop on a subscription basis rather than as a costly one-time purchase.\n\nThis strategic pivot is bearing fruit, especially in niche areas like the Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, both of which are performing strongly. Although News Corp currently places less emphasis on dividends to focus on adapting its operations for the digital era, it still offers a modest 1.65% total yield, striking a balance between operational changes and shareholder returns.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Steelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteelcase (NYSE:SCS), a high-end office furniture company, emerges as a standout under-$50 value stock that retail traders tend to skip over. The company is thriving post-pandemic as it adapts to the evolving work-from-home trends, underscored by its recent declaration of a $0.10 quarterly dividend, representing a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase has rapidly regained its financial stability after a challenging pandemic period. Its latest quarterly report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, more than doubled from last year’s figure. Furthermore, sales have maintained a steady pace of around $800 million over the past five quarters, showing that Steelcase is improving margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nIn reaction to the shifting work-from-home landscape, Steelcase is repositioning to target 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin (as a percentage of revenue) over the next five years. At the same time, the company has significantly cut its debt to better cope with the higher-rate environment, enhancing liquidity and reducing interest costs. These strategic initiatives mark Steelcase as one of the most promising stocks under-$50 stocks to buy now.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough Snap (NYSE:SNAP) contends with competitive pressures as younger users flock to newer apps, the under-$50 stock is far from defeated. Instead, it’s buoyed by its virtual and augmented reality strides and a growing advertising platform.\n\nSnap aims to surpass 475 million daily active users in 2024, setting a target above Wall Street’s expectations. The app’s appeal is further enhanced by its vast array of augmented reality lenses, created by over 350,000 AR developers and totaling nearly 3.5 million lenses.\n\nFinancially, Snap’s short-term prospects look promising, with advertising revenue expected to grow by more than 20% in 2024, surpassing Wall Street’s forecast of 14% and aligning with Snap’s ambitious goals. For the upcoming quarter, Snap anticipates revenue between $1,095 million and $1,135 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 11% to 15%. These positive indicators position Snap as a compelling choice among under-$50 stocks, especially for those bullish on long-term augmented reality trends.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Braze, Inc. (BRZE) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nAdvertising technology is undergoing a quiet renaissance as digital consumer trends evolve and media becomes more centered around content creators. Venture capital is pouring into private AdTech firms, yet publicly traded Braze, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRZE) stands out as an under-$50 stock ideally positioned to capitalize on these emerging marketing trends. Braze enables brands to manage multichannel marketing across all major digital platforms, adopting a fresh and unique approach.\n\nUnlike traditional AdTech companies that target consumer segments through aggressive campaigns, Braze excels in navigating consumer engagement practices. It manages curated journeys that follow users across platforms and deliver a personalized and unique experience. This personalization fosters a mental connection between the user and the brand, effectively converting potential customers. This effective strategy is why well-known entities like Match (NASDAQ:MTCH), NASCAR, and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) flock to Braze’s distinctive services.\n\nAlthough Braze is not yet profitable and trades at a premium today, despite its under-$50 pricing, the company is a pioneer in emerging advertising trends. Early entrants in such dynamic sectors often require time to build momentum and achieve profitability, so get in on the ground floor before it’s too late.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs startups and established companies increasingly harness GPT-derived “innovations,” Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) emerges as a robust EdTech contender, using artificial intelligence to transform traditional learning institutions and concepts. Although its shares currently trade nearly one-third lower than their January pricing, Chegg’s solid fourth-quarter report has led to a new wave of analyst upgrades in anticipation of the first-quarter report due on April 29th.\n\nThe company already boasts a solid gross margin of 68%, with management predicting even higher margins for 2024 despite a slight dip in revenue and subscription rates in 2023. These forecasts come as the company invests heavily in R&D and related costs to develop new AI offerings and tailor them to evolving trends and technologies.\n\nCEO Dan Rosensweig has acknowledged the challenging balancing act, stating that the team “completely reinvented the company by leveraging the advancements in artificial intelligence” and that, as the initial AI hype wanes, “leaders in their verticals like Chegg are taking control of their own destiny by building their own models [that offer] higher quality and lower cost.” Chegg is finding its footing within the AI-enabled EdTech landscape. As more individuals and institutions adopt forward-looking technologies, this under-$50 stock is poised to potentially surge significantly in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off.\n\n“We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.”\n\nBut generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nMeta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter.\n\nStrap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks.\n\nGenerative AI takes center stage again\n\nThe generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. Microsoft will report earnings on April 25 as investors wait to learn more about how the company is monetizing its AI strategy. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n“We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year-to-date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That’s sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nBut the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform.\n\n“You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia will relinquish its lead in the market anytime soon. It’s still miles ahead of rivals AMD and Intel in terms of market share, and it just debuted its Blackwell architecture during its GTC developer conference in March, which should put it even further ahead.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“They still have a commanding lead and share, and their influence is huge, and they are not slowing down, to their credit,” O’Donnell said. “But the law of big numbers starts to kick in at a certain point.”\n\nThen there are the hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google. While they’ve been riding the AI hype train, many of their generative AI software offerings are still in the works, meaning it’s a bit early to get a full read on overall uptake among enterprise and consumer customers. Still, Wall Street will likely be looking for at least some revenue growth from the companies’ AI investments.\n\n“How much is AI driving [Microsoft’s] Azure? How much is AI driving Google Cloud growth? How much is it continuing to help AWS which has sort of seen its numbers slow,” said Newman.\n\nIn its last quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to its Azure revenue, up from 3 percentage points in the prior quarter. And you can bet analysts will be looking to see if the company can keep that kind of growth up in the current quarter.\n\nAmazon also pointed to AI as a growth catalyst during its last earnings call, saying revenue was \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers showed interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see if the company provides any more context around that acceleration in its upcoming earnings call.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle, like Microsoft, will also likely face questions about sales of its AI-enhanced productivity suite and how customers are responding. The company, which will host its I/O developer conference in May, has also faced controversy over its AI rollout, pulling back its Gemini AI generator after it generated historically inaccurate images.\n\nApple on deck\n\nApple’s earnings will also be a hot ticket but don’t expect the company to reveal anything about its future generative AI plans.\n\n“Apple needs to disclose something, but the company has never really been in a hurry to pacify industry investors,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think they're going to wait until WWDC in a couple of months to bring that out.”\n\nOutside of AI, investors are eagerly anticipating Apple’s iPhone revenue numbers and commentary on its lawsuits. On Monday, market intelligence firm IDC reported that global iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the current quarter. That could have a significant impact on Apple’s overall revenue.\n\nSales in China are also a problem for the company. Apple reported revenue in its third-largest market declined 13% in the prior quarter. That, coupled with falling iPhone shipments, could spell trouble for the company’s earnings.\n\nDespite those headwinds, however, there could be a bright spot. According to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple should report double-digit growth in its Services segment, which could help buoy overall sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe company’s upcoming earrings will also give investors their first glimpse into Vision Pro sales, which should offer some insight into early consumer and enterprise interest in the AR/VR headset.\n\nDigital advertising sales on the rise\n\nMeta and Google will also be on deck to show whether they can keep up the momentum in the digital advertising market. In the prior quarter, Meta’s ad sales jumped 24%, while Google’s ad sales, including YouTube ads, increased 11%.\n\nAmazon, which has built its own impressive advertising business, could also see continued ad sales growth. In the prior quarter, the company reported advertising revenue of $14.7 billion, up 27% year over year. Another performance like that could provide a nice boost to the company’s bottom line.\n\nAnalysts will also be on the lookout to see if AI is impacting advertising sales.\n\n“Theoretically, targeting should be better by using AI even with the deprecation of the cookie, but we haven't seen that yet,” Moorhead said. “To me, the evidence that I would have to see is a higher cost per click or a better CPM.”\n\nWe’ll find out all of that and more when Big Tech earnings kick off next week.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Opinion: These Will Be the 4 Largest Companies by 2035",
        "content": "Just 11 years ago, Apple, ExxonMobil, Alphabet, and Berkshire Hathaway were the four largest American companies. Today, only two of those companies -- Apple and Alphabet -- remain in the top four. Berkshire Hathaway has slipped to No. 7, and ExxonMobil and Walmart have fallen from the top 10 altogether.\n\nA lot can change in only 11 years. Let's look at the companies I believe will claim the top four spots in 2035. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nBy 2035, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will be the world's largest company by market cap. What's more, I think it could happen even sooner.\n\nOne reason is that Nvidia has already grown faster than nearly anyone expected. The company's market cap has exploded almost 10x, from $0.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion in less than two years. NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nThe massive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is behind the company's rapid rise. Thanks to its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia is well-positioned to take the crown as the largest company by 2035 -- if not sooner. That's because the GPU market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. According to Global Markets Insights, the size of the GPU market is set to expand from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2032.\n\nWhat's more, the ramp in GPU spending is already here. Nvidia's sales increased by a mind-blowing 265% year over year in its most recent quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28, 2024). While sales are expected to cool somewhat, analysts still expect the company to grow them by 82% this year.\n\nOver the next five years, given the explosive growth of the overall GPU market, analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 37% per year, meaning the company's annual revenue by 2030 could approach $300 billion.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is riding a tsunami of growth that could carry it all the way to the top spot by 2035.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.2 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's largest company, having passed Apple last year.\n\nLike Nvidia, the AI revolution has lifted Microsoft's market cap significantly. The company's extensive and iconic software suite offers a natural home for AI-powered tools, and it has wasted no time integrating AI features into its software.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft enjoys a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That partnership has already helped both companies and puts Microsoft in a good spot to benefit from future AI breakthroughs that OpenAI may make. AI will likely be the key factor in driving market caps higher over the next decade, and Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of growth, analysts expect Microsoft to grow sales by 16% per year over the next five years, implying annual sales of over $475 billion by 2030. That's nearly in line with an internal target set by chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella of $500 billion in revenue by 2030. Either way, Microsoft's expected growth shows that the company has staying power, and while the company may not be able to stay ahead of Nvidia, it will likely keep its lead over everyone else.\n\nAmazon\n\nWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is currently America's fifth-largest company. But by 2035, I see it leapfrogging a number of companies, including Apple and Alphabet, to take the third spot.\n\nThat's because Amazon, like Nvidia and Microsoft before it, has a natural way to benefit from the AI revolution. The company already utilizes more than 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouses. They measure and pack products, move heavy items, read labels, and distribute shelves and packages.\n\nIn addition, AI should help the company improve the digital side of its e-commerce business. AI assistants can shop for customers and help with returns. AI-powered ad tools can refine which customers see which ads, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and generating more ad revenue for Amazon. Moreover, the company's crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), should continue to benefit from the transition to the cloud over the next decade.\n\nAmazon is already one of the largest companies by revenue; the company has generated $575 billion over the last 12 months -- second only to Walmart's $648 billion. However, Amazon is closing the gap quickly and should overtake Walmart soon. Analysts expect Amazon to grow its revenue by 31% per year over the next five years, bringing annual revenue to an eye-popping $2.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nThanks to its impressive revenue growth, I think Amazon will climb the rankings up to third place.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nRounding out the top four is MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META). Currently the sixth-largest American company by market cap, I expect Meta to leapfrog both Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nMeta is quickly becoming one of the world's biggest cash cows. The company's lucrative ad business continues to grow by leaps and bounds as the digital advertising market expands. Moreover, Meta's ambitious AI research and development could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs over the next decade.\n\nIn terms of revenue, analysts expect Meta to grow revenue by 26% annually over the next five years, leading to an annual total of $429 billion by 2030.\n\nAt any rate, with its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) providing ample free cash flow, Meta is well-positioned to grow its market cap significantly over the next decade, so it could surpass laggards like Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMD's Cost-Effective Strategy Is Intelligent, but the Valuation Is Troubling",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the world's favorite artificial intelligence investments currently. I believe its position in the market is very clever, as it focuses on appealing to cost-conscious buyers still looking for advanced computation capabilities. However, I think we should remember that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) by far offers the most expansive ecosystem for AI, and it is developing this into something truly special. AMD can compete in the portion of the market it is targeting, but the long-term prospects for the stock remain speculative given the present valuation multiples.\n\nOperations analysis\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nAMD is one of the most compelling companies working in AI chip development, but its most significant, and certainly stronger, competitor is Nvidia. For quite some time, I have been concerned about whether the valuation of the stock is too risky, and it is fair to say the investment comes with potential valuation drawbacks, even though the company's future growth looks good. I do believe the market has slightly gotten ahead of itself here with too much enthusiasm, and a correction could occur. But it must be said that AMD is firing on all cylinders as it relates to becoming even more significant in AI and, as such, I can see why the market has placed such a premium on the shares. One has to question, though, whether this premium is market enthusiasm or wider speculation from non-professional investors who are not tuned in enough to the fundamentals and instead just want to invest in AI.\n\nThe company is not just a powerhouse in advanced chips, where its production of central processing units and graphics processing units are key to operating AI technologies. It also offers a range of products and services for high-level computers. It is becoming apparent that it may be able to offer some competitive advantage over Nvidia in certain areas. While Nvidia is focused long term on the full-stack market for AI, similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, but specializing in AI services, AMD is focused on selling elite capabilities of compute at good value for money. The company is focusing on performance per dollar and innovative technologies at accessible prices, but the market notices this is an exceptional strategy. Unfortunately, it perhaps leaves little room for outside investors to reap the benefits at this time without taking on excess valuation risk because of how widely spread it is being accepted that AMD's strategy is onto something vital.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer analysis\n\nMy research has shown me that Nvidia's current position in the market is undoubtedly the strongest. In second place behind it, I believe, is AMD. But also important are Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) in GPUs, ARM, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in CPUs and servers and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Samsung (SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in custom semiconductor solutions. It is quite clear that the clever and best companies involved in technology software and hardware want to flesh out their own AI divisions, but there still comes the point where some outsourcing is necessary for top-level results. Apple produces its own chips now, which is its role in custom solutions, but other computer manufacturers who do not have the same trillion-dollar-plus market cap are going to be looking to Nvidia, AMD, Intel and others to provide the chips to fuel the demand for ever-increasing power in laptops, desktops and intelligent devices.\n\nAs smaller hardware companies seek to join the ranks of companies who offer AI integrated with devices, I believe AMD has the strongest competitive positioning if it continues to hone in on cost-effective advanced CPUs and GPUs. By doing so, it caters to a critical part of the market that other providers would be less focused on as they serve the larger, full-stack needs of conglomerates, big data companies and those working with highly advanced technology like robotics.\n\nHowever, suppose AMD fails to flesh out its AI ecosystem effectively. In that case, it might lose out in its current target market to Nvidia more than investors are currently pricing into the stock. What customers are going to want is ease of access to advanced AI tasks. Beyond pure compute provision, a unified platform to manage AI workloads that Nivida is aiming for with its full-stack approach may be much more compelling in the long run as AI tasks become more complex and demand for advanced capabilities scales. This should apply even to smaller companies that can afford it. While AMD has partnerships to help in this regard, its profitability will suffer if it does not provide the core foundation for the demanded capabilities.\n\nOn that note, I am particularly keen on AMD's balance sheet, which shows an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.82. In comparison, Nvidia's ratio is 0.65, while Broadcom's is just 0.40. I believe AMD's strength in its balance sheet will serve it well with any needs that may arise where it needs to invest more heavily in full-stack solutions. The company can notably take on more debt without too much damage to its financial agility or sense of security for shareholders.\n\nValuation\n\nFirst, consider the following chart, which presents the main valuation multiples of what I consider to be some of the most competitive peers to AMD:\n\nAMD Nvidia Intel Broadcom ARM P/E Ratio Without NRI 116 71.6 35.8 32.4 165.6 P/S Ratio 12 35.6 2.9 15 44.6 P/FCF Ratio 241.8 80.4 NM 31.5 171.9\n\nFrom the above chart, it is quite clear that AMD sells at a very high multiples, but we can also see its multiples are not uncommon in its industry for the major players, other than its free cash flow ratio, which is the highest of all the five peers listed. I believe there is some truth to the statement that AMD is investing heavily in future growth, so it is taking a profitability hit in the near term in exchange for long-term gains. I do believe AMD will stabilize its profitability in due course, and then its price-earnings multiples will become much more tolerable. But as we can see, its revenue growth has shown to be very promising, which is indicated in the lower price-sales ratio against Nvidia, ARM Holdings and Broadcom.\n\nIn my opinion, the valuation for AMD is not intolerable, but it certainly exposes investors to a lot of risks if it struggles in achieving expectations or if it struggles to manifest long-term profitability at a scale that investors are currently anticipating. It has proven it can generate rapid and lasting revenue growth, and I am certain in time, it will translate this into a stronger bottom line, but there is also the consideration of growing expenditures to remain competitive, especially as it relates to my comments about it not having a full-stack ecosystem, which it may decide it needs to develop, albeit at a smaller scale to Nvidia, to remain relevant. Therefore, I can see some long-term risk here which could cause present enthusiasm to deflate, and I think investors who bought in at present prices run the risk of losing a significant amount of capital if adverse conditions arise.\n\nPutting the AI market valuation risks into perspective\n\nI view AMD very favorably, so I think the market has priced the shares high for a reason. Based on my research of the industry, I have come to believe the present AI enthusiasm is not a bubble like during the internet boom of the 1990s. Instead, the results of this technological shift look to be much more profound and lasting, but the potential for speculative behavior still remains. While in the 1990s, many companies went to zero, in this period, I believe the potential for speculation simply means more likelihood of volatility.\n\nI do not think we will see as many failed companies, primarily due to the expensive barriers to entry, but also because the financial benefits of AI will cause fundamental growth like margin expansion and potential deflationary effects on the wider economy. That will make AI businesses worth much more than dot-com companies were over the long term. AMD has proven itself to be a stand-out player, and so the likelihood is short-to-medium-term volatility with long-term growth. Now just does not seem to be the most prudent time to allocate to the company as a value investor.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nI think AMD could have periods of turbulence, but as long as it continues to allocate its resources with an effective strategy aimed at value and does not find it needs to invest too heavily in expensive new technologies, which may disrupt its long-term profitability, I believe the long-term returns should be good. It is not quite right for my risk appetite, and I do not believe it works for investors heavily focused on stock valuations, but nonetheless, the company's operations are undeniably strong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.7% over the past month to $23.84.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made a lot of millionaires over the last year as its share price skyrocketed 225%. The company rallied investors as it became the poster child for a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, the chart above shows that Nvidia's meteoric rise has made it an expensive option compared to other tech stocks. Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are significantly higher than the same metrics for Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health alongside its share price.\n\nFor both, the lower the figure, the better the value. As a result, Intel and Apple are trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia.\n\nSo, forget Nvidia and consider these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel\n\nShares in Intel have risen more than 135% since it went public in 1971, creating plenty of millionaires along the way.\n\nHowever, the company has hit a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and the end of a partnership with Apple that lasted more than decade.\n\nIntel responded to recent headwinds by introducing significant structural changes that could pay off in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025. This would see it adopt a model similar to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, becoming a major provider of foundry capacity in North America and Europe.\n\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI, a market valued at about $200 billion last year and projected to hit nearly $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nIn December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi 3, a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to challenge similar offerings from market leader Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\n\nIntel's forward P/E of 26 makes it one of the best-valued AI chip stocks right now, with Nvidia's at 35 and AMD's even higher at 45. As a result, the company's stock is a lower-risk way to invest in the AI chip industry and an excellent option to hold over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has a long reputation for providing investors with consistent and significant gains. In fact, Warren Buffett's holdings company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated 43% of its portfolio to Apple. Meanwhile, the iPhone company's shares have soared 571% since Berkshire first invested in 2016.\n\nApple has made many millionaires in its time, and it's unlikely to stop as the company continues to dominate consumer tech and expand into budding sectors like AI.\n\nShares in Apple popped 4% on April 11, marking its best performance in almost a year. The rally came after a Bloomberg report revealed the company will overhaul its Mac computer lineup to center around AI capabilities.\n\nApple dominates consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories. Immense brand loyalty from consumers could see the company become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, allowing Apple to carve out a lucrative position in the market. As a result, news that future products will place a stronger focus on the generative technology is promising. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMoreover, despite recent headwinds, Apple achieved $107 billion in free cash flow last year, significantly more than rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet. The figure indicates Apple has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nWith significant cash resources, an expanding position in AI, and a comparatively low forward P/E, Apple's stock is worth considering over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast Amid High Inflation: 5 Picks",
        "content": "On Apr 16, the International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast for 2023 to 3.2% from 3.1% in January. More importantly, the agency projected that global growth will remain static at 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025 despite elevated inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe IMF projected that the global headline inflation will decline gradually from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. However, the average global growth rate for the next five years will be 3.1%, marking the lowest medium-term growth forecast in decades.\n\nIMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas urged central bankers to be on track to bring down the inflation rate to their respective target levels. According to Gourinchas, “As the global economy approaches a soft landing, the near-term priority for central banks is to ensure that inflation touches down smoothly, by neither easing policies prematurely nor delaying too long and causing target undershoots.”\n\nThe IMF said that the U.S. economy will remain resilient and is likely to grow at 2.7% annually in 2024 after growing 2.5% in 2023. However, the GDP growth rate is expected to converge to the pre-pandemic level of 1.9% in 2025.\n\nOn Apr 16, speaking to a policy forum focused on U.S.-Canada economic relations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy remains strong and the inflation rate has failed to reduce to the level expected by the Fed. For that, the central bank is compelled to keep a higher interest rate for a longer period.\n\nThe Fed fund rate is at its 23-year high in the range of 5.25-5.5%. In late February, the CME FedWatch tool showed a nearly 80% probability of the first rate cut in June. At present, that probability is a mere 13%. The majority of market participants are now anticipating the first rate cut to happen in September.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital >$100 billion) as these companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have popped more than 25% year to date with strong potential left for 2024.

        "title": "Up Nearly 80% This Year, Does Nvidia's Stock Have Room for More?",
        "content": "After having an incredible 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) hasn't slowed a bit in 2024. It's up nearly 80% this year, placing among the top-performing stocks again in back-to-back years.\n\nBut because of such a tremendous start, most wonder if Nvidia has room for more upside. I think it does, but there's also a possibility it could reverse course.\n\nNvidia is a key part of the AI technological boom\n\nNvidia has been a rockstar of a stock because of its ties to artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary product, graphics processing units (GPUs), are an integral part of training AI models due to their ability to compute in parallel. When GPUs are tasked to train an AI model, companies don't just use one or two of them. Instead, they use thousands to increase the computing power.\n\nNvidia's flagship GPU for training AI models is the H100, and it costs around $40,000 apiece. When companies purchase these GPUs by the thousands at that price, it's a great sign for Nvidia's business.\n\nThis has shown up in Nvidia's financial results in a big way, like when its revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Jan. 28). With the infrastructure needed to train all of these AI models not yet built, it's a great sign for Nvidia that the demand for its product will still be high.\n\nThis is the base thesis on why Nvidia's stock still has room for upside, as no one knows when there will be enough computing capacity to quench the demand for AI training. However, there's a flip side to this coin as well.\n\nOnce the industry has built out the computing power it needs to satisfy the demand, Nvidia's revenue stream will dry up. Its GPUs are one-time purchases unless a client upgrades, which could be an issue. Nvidia will still be around, as it has multiple other business segments. But, with so much of its revenue coming from this AI demand wave, Nvidia will eventually face a downturn.\n\nIt's unknown how long it will take to build all the computing power for AI demand or when it will start to plateau. This is the debate behind Nvidia's stock, but we'll get a better glimpse of how it's going in a month.\n\nNvidia's stock could move either way after its Q1 earnings\n\nWhile Nvidia's stock is up almost 80% this year, it's only up 12% since its last earnings report. That's because most news that drives the stock will be released in that announcement.\n\nIf past trends hold, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results should be announced sometime in late May. If Nvidia's management gives positive forward-looking guidance and says it will maintain the status quo, don't be surprised if the stock gains even more. But if management discusses demand leveling out, be prepared for a severe sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a lot of expectations built into the stock, and one of those is strong growth for all of this year. By looking at the difference between a stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio versus its forward P/E, you can calculate the expected earnings growth rate for the year. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nFor Nvidia, that's 109%. So, Nvidia must at least double its earnings, or it will fall short of analyst expectations.\n\nThat's a high bar to clear, but considering Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) grew by 765% in Q4, it's possible.\n\nSo, to answer the question, does Nvidia's stock have room for more? I'd say absolutely. If AI demand continues to drive Nvidia's revenue higher than expectations, it could still rise further. But, if it fails to meet those lofty goals, the stock has a long way to tumble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 63% and 70%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The past year or so has marked a coming-of-age story for artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI's ability to generate original content and streamline time-consuming processes represents a potential step change in how business gets done. The opportunity to profit from the productivity gains made possible by these next-generation algorithms has many companies scrambling to determine how best to integrate them into their day-to-day operations.\n\nDespite generating market-beating performances in 2023, some market watchers believe there's more to come for AI stocks. In fact, a pair of Wall Street analysts suggest two still have potential upside of 63% and 70% over the coming year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence buy No. 1: Nvidia -- 63% implied upside\n\nIf there is one stock that exemplifies the potential represented by recent advancements in AI, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would certainly be in the running. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) use parallel processing, the ability to process a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking the data into smaller chunks to make it more manageable. This not only revolutionized gaming but also enabled the evolution of AI.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia delivered revenue that grew 126% year over year to roughly $61 billion, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 586% to $11.93. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ends April 30), Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, an increase of 234% year over year. Management left no doubt that the accelerating demand for generative AI was behind the surge.\n\nDespite the stock rising 488% since the start of 2023 (as of this writing), Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, the self-professed \"most bullish analyst on Nvidia,\" has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $1,400 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 63% compared to Monday's closing price. Mosesmann said, \"The shift to accelerated compute away from general compute is reaching a tipping point, and a disruptive new app, generative AI, is creating a whole new industry.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish take. Of the 56 analysts who issued an opinion in March, 52 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and not one recommended selling. That's amazing, considering Wall Street never agrees on anything.\n\nNvidia stock is currently selling for 34 times forward earnings. While that's a premium to the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500, the company's triple-digit growth and strong tailwinds suggest it's worthy of a premium.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence buy No. 2: Super Micro Computer -- 70% implied upside\n\nWhile Nvidia provides the GPUs necessary to train and run AI systems, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, incorporates these state-of-the-art chips and others into high-end servers specially designed to withstand the rigors of AI processing.\n\nThe company's focus on energy efficiency is well-documented, as is its building-block architecture. Supermicro offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, providing AI-centric server solutions for every budget and technology level.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter, Supermicro generated revenue that grew 103% year over year to roughly $3.7 billion, while its adjusted EPS jumped 71% to $5.59. And management believes the company's growth spurt will continue to accelerate. Supermicro is forecasting third-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion and EPS of $5.22 at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent year-over-year growth of 205% and 220%, respectively.\n\nThe stock is up an incredible 975% since the start of 2023, but some believe significant upside remains. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $1,500 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 70% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nBaruah is increasingly confident in Supermicro's position in the generative AI server space and its leadership in addressing the increasing complexity and scale of the server industry. Furthermore, he believes the company can achieve a revenue run rate of $40 billion by the end of its fiscal 2026. For context, that runs circles around the $7.1 billion it generated in its fiscal 2023 (ended Jun. 30).\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish take. Of the 15 analysts who covered the stock in March, 11 rated it a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling. Supermicro stock is also attractively priced, currently selling for 3 times forward sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying 2 of Its Biggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Rivals Instead",
        "content": "The past 30 years have been filled with no shortage of next-big-thing investment opportunities. Although nothing has surpassed the advent of the internet in terms of game-changing potential for corporate America, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may give it a run for its money.\n\nWhen discussing AI, I'm talking about the use of software and systems in place of humans. With machine learning, these systems can evolve over time without human intervention to become more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps expand their scope of work to include entirely new tasks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, the analysts at PwC released a report (\"Sizing the Prize, PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution\") that estimated AI would add close to $16 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. If this prognostication is anywhere in the ballpark to what actually occurs in six years' time, AI stocks have the potential to skyrocket.\n\nNo publicly traded company has arguably benefited more from the AI revolution than semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWall Street's top billionaire money managers bid adieu to Nvidia\n\nSeemingly overnight, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the talk of businesses wanting to harness the power of AI. For the moment, the company's A100 and H100 GPUs have a borderline monopoly on GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers.\n\nNvidia also has the luxury of exceptional pricing power. Enterprise demand for the company's GPUs has completely overwhelmed the supply of these products. The law of supply and demand suggests that if an in-demand product is in short supply, the price of that product will increase until demand wanes.\n\nBut not all Wall Street professionals are sold on the idea that Nvidia is the AI stock to own. During the December-ended quarter, eight high-profile billionaires reduced their respective fund's stakes in the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nWhile a lot has gone right for Nvidia since the opening bell rang in 2023, the company is now facing a growing list of headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor starters, its immaculate pricing power is likely to decline in the quarters to come. Nvidia is increasing its production of AI-focused GPUs and will be facing an influx of competition. A majority of the 217% sales growth registered in Nvidia's data center segment in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) was the result of strong pricing power tied to GPU scarcity. This scarcity won't be a tailwind for much longer.\n\nTo add to the above, Nvidia has more than external competition to worry about. Its four largest customers by revenue -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are developing in-house AI chips for their respective data centers. This is approximately 40% of Nvidia's net sales at risk of being lost or diminished.\n\nRegulators have been of no help, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs to China, the world's No. 2 economy. This includes the toned-down A800 and H800 GPUs Nvidia had specifically designed for its Chinese customers.\n\nLastly, every next-big-thing innovation over the past three decades has worked its way through an early period of euphoria. In other words, bubbles are the expectation when investors pile into a new trend, and AI is unlikely to be an exception. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires are piling into two of Nvidia's top artificial intelligence rivals\n\nBut while billionaire investors were busy ringing the register on Nvidia during the fourth quarter, they were, interestingly enough, also piling into two of the company's chief architectural rivals.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nThe first core competitor found in AI-accelerated data centers that top-tier billionaire asset managers gravitated to during the December-ended quarter is Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). Form 13F flings show that four billionaires were buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (4,737,399 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (3,506,881 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (570,035 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (23,383 shares)\n\nThe driving force behind this excitement looks to be the ramp up of AMD's MI300X AI-GPU. When AMD unveiled its flagship MI300X in June, it was billed as a \"generative AI accelerator.\" This is a fancy way of saying that it'll be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's H100 to power generative AI solutions and train large language models (LLMs) for businesses. Although the rollout of the MI300X began last year, production wasn't expected to meaningfully pick up until this year.\n\nBut what investors might be overlooking is that AMD has more going for it than just its AI ambitions. Over the past decade, it's been steadily \"chipping away\" at Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) central processing unit (CPU) share lead in personal computers (PCs) and data centers. Even though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same pace as GPUs, AMD's share gains in these segments are providing a hearty boost to operating cash flow.\n\nTo add, the PC market should enjoy a bit of a rebound in the not-too-distant future. Though demand for PCs soared then plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD notes that Client segment sales surged 62% from the prior-year period during the fourth quarter. It would appear that a stabilization in PC sales is well underway.\n\nBillionaires might also be excited about AMD's growth prospects, relative to Nvidia. Whereas Wall Street's consensus pegs Nvidia to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 24.6% next year, the forecast for AMD calls for EPS growth of 26%.\n\nIntel\n\nThe second artificial intelligence rival of Nvidia that billionaires can't stop buying is Intel. During the December-ended quarter, five billionaire money managers purchased shares, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,735,308 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,532,812 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (817,955 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (452,556 shares)\n\nSimilar to AMD, Intel is attempting to grab its share of the AI-accelerated data center market with the introduction of Gaudi 3. The company officially unveiled its H100 competitor last week as a tool that'll power LLMs and generative AI solutions for broad-scale businesses.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about Intel's GPU lineup is that it's developed a compliant version for export to China that meets the conditions laid out by U.S. regulators. Neither Nvidia nor AMD have laid out products or plans to make that happen as of yet. Although Nvidia is the undisputed market share leader in high-compute data centers domestically, Intel could reasonably become the preferred choice in the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nBeyond AI, Intel has its legacy CPU operations to fall back on. Though AMD has been gaining share in recent years, Intel remains the runaway leader in PC and data center CPU share. This means it's generating plenty of cash flow to fund other high-growth initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, Intel is busy building its foundry services segment from the ground up. Even though its foundry operations are expected to generate sizable losses for the foreseeable future, Intel's aggressive investments in chip fabrication have it on track to become the world's No. 2 foundry by the turn of the decade.\n\nIntel is one of the few semiconductor stocks that would probably be well-insulated if the AI bubble burst -- and billionaire asset managers likely know it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed the most recent trading day at $876.90, moving +1.96% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.03%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.41%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.12%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had lost 2.77% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.55% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.9% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $5.48, reflecting a 402.75% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $24.17 billion, indicating a 236.08% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $23.84 per share and revenue of $105.87 billion, indicating changes of +83.95% and +73.79%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.72% upward. Nvidia is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nWith respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 36.07. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.84, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NVDA's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.11 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 172, finds itself in the bottom 32% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Last week, I recommended “5 Stocks to Buy as Interest Rates Begin to Fall.” Declining borrowing costs looked set to turn these loss-making firms profitable again – a historically bullish sign for stocks. The five companies also had strong underlying businesses; their lack of profitability was from financing issues, not operational ones.\n\nAn unexpectedly hot March inflation report this past week now pushes their turnarounds back several months. Shares of one pick – Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN) – fell as much as 15% on the prospect of rates staying higher for longer. Fortunately, this only delays these companies’ recovery because their underlying businesses remain strong. Monopolistic firms like Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) will have no trouble shouldering another several quarters of high-than-average interest payments.\n\nHowever, not every indebted firm is so lucky. Many high-debt firms are unprofitable enterprises that borrowed money to stay afloat. And their cases, even a two-month delay of interest rate cutting could be enough to push them over the edge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s why our writers at InvestorPlace.com – our free news and analysis website – took a good, hard look at a handful of former high-flying firms this week that are now struggling under their financial weight. It’s a warning that Louis Navellier’s special guest echoes in their latest presentation.\n\nIndeed, if the Fed delays its rate-cutting schedule further as Louis’s special guest expects, be sure to sell these five companies as soon as you can… or avoid them if you haven’t bought their shares yet…\n\n5 Stocks to Sell Immediately: Fisker (FSRN) Fisker Automotive (FSRN) is an American Luxury vehicle company. Fisker stock\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nEddie Pan examines what went wrong at Fisker (OTCMKTS:FSRN). In a detailed report at InvestorPlace.com, he finds that Henrik Fisker’s second company – Fisker Automotive, which declared bankruptcy in 2013, was the first – is now at risk of imploding:\n\nFirst, it’s hard to miss the extremely competitive EV landscape that has witnessed a multitude of headwinds during the past few years, including supply chain issues, price wars, and a higher cost of borrowing. Making matters worse, Fisker was dealing with its own internal issues at the same time.\n\nIn its preliminary fourth quarter earnings, the company announced a 15% workforce reduction, a delayed Form 10-K, and an impending going concern warning following the submission of its 10-K. Fisker produced 10,193 Oceans in 2023 and delivered only 4,929 of them, signaling a clear demand problem.\n\nStory continues\n\nEssentially, Fisker is building cars that too few buyers want. Clownishly negative reviews of Fisker Ocean have recently gone viral on social media, leading to widespread order cancellations of Fisker’s flagship vehicle. The company has now cut MSRP prices on its Ocean Extreme from $61,499 to $37,499.\n\nThat’s probably too little, too late. Fisker’s most recent balance sheet showed just $326 million of cash left on hand, or less than four months of liquidity. And high borrowing costs means it must turn to increasingly onerous financing deals to keep itself alive, such as a $150 million convertible note issuance in March. Its 2026 bonds now trade at 1.5 cents on the dollar.\n\nThough Fisker began with a solid concept of bringing affordable e-SUVs to American buyers, its financing and operational issues mean our writers believe it’s time to sell whatever you might have left.\n\n2. Lucid Motors (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur writers have also turned bearish on Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID), once considered the most likely company to beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at its own game. A beautiful car design and deep backing by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund meant that the car firm had a long runway to reach scale.\n\nHowever, the wealth fund has since found Lucid Motors to be a bottomless money pit. The company has lost $6.7 billion since 2021, and won’t become profitable until at least 2026, if it ever does at all. Its most recent debt funding round valued shares at just $3.60.\n\nDwindling financing options could hardly come at a worse time, as Terel Miles bluntly puts it at InvestorPlace.com:\n\nLucid’s hunger for capital is no secret at this point. The company has been burning through cash at an alarming rate to fund its expansion plans.\n\nIt has gotten to a point where it’s not if but when the company will raise more capital and dilute shareholders. Their access to capital and number of high-profile investors has been the company’s kryptonite.\n\nThat’s made Lucid’s debtholders increasingly wary. Lucid’s 2026 convertible debt now trades at 51 cents on the dollar, down from par as recently as 2022. That essentially blocks the EV startup from issuing any more debt, because no reasonable investor would buy debt at face value.\n\nLucid also suffers from its unusual exposure to a Residual Value Guarantee program, which promises to reimburse its vehicle lessors for losses in resale value. High car loan rates and EV oversupply has pushed companies like Tesla to slash prices, driving down the values of used vehicles. Though these contracts only contributed to $28.7 million of Lucid’s 2023 losses, their existence means further declines in EV values not only hurts new sales. Losses will extend to old sales as well.\n\n3. Hertz (HTZ) Hertz (HTZ) sign in Montevrain, France on May 8, 2016.\n\nSource: aureliefrance / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree years ago, I wrote why Hertz Global (NASDAQ:HTZ) could become the top penny stock of 2021. The company’s large asset base (in the form of its rental fleet) and exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic bizarrely meant that the longer the company spent in bankruptcy court, the better the chance of its ultimate survival.\n\nThe results were fantastic. By the end of the year, the pandemic had begun to recede, driving up used-car prices and sending Hertz’s stock up tenfold.\n\nHowever, poor financial decisions have since turned me and other InvestorPlace.com writers bearish about the company’s underlying asset value. In January, the car rental firm announced it was taking a $245 million hit to its earnings from a poorly placed bet on EVs. Its CEO would be forced out by March. Hertz also failed to use its post-bankruptcy windfall to pay down its debts. Its total liabilities today are over twice as high as when I first covered the stock.\n\nHere’s what Louis Navellier and his team now say about this once-promising turnaround.\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 lockdowns that crippled the auto rental industry, Hertz bet big on EVs, hoping that the fleet would be appealing to customers. But when Tesla cut prices on its cars across the board and other EV makers followed suit, Hertz was left with a high-priced fleet with a much weaker resale value.\n\nNow that CEO Stephen Scherr stepped down, investors may be tempted to give Hertz another chance to get it right. But I don’t recommend it. HTZ stock is down 26% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDebt markets are equally wary. Moody’s now assigns Hertz a B3 rating on its senior note, which historically suggests a 26% chance of default over the next 10 years. Buyer beware. A strong brand name means little when debts are piled this high.\n\n4. Spirit (SAVE) Spirit Airlines (SAVE) is the leading Ultra Low Cost Carrier in the United States. Spirit Aircrafts at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport\n\nSource: YES Market Media / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen the U.S. Justice Department blocked a merger between Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and JetBlue  (NASDAQ:JBLU) in March, InvestorPlace.com writer Eddie Pan warned that it could cause Spirit to file for bankruptcy and liquidate assets. Spirit is a historically unprofitable airline, and it’s increasingly unlikely that it can turn a profit as a standalone company.\n\nRising financing costs now threaten to end Spirit’s run within a year. Prices of its 2025 convertible debt have fallen from par at the start of the year to trading at roughly 45 cents on the dollar. S&P Global has now downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to “CCC+,” giving a 3-year default probability in the 20%-30% range.\n\nIan Bezek goes a step further at InvestorPlace.com, calling the struggling airline a “walking dead company to avoid:”\n\nUnfortunately for Spirit, it finds itself in a weak position as an independent airline. The airline has been losing money, and it currently has significant capacity constraints due to engine defects that grounded a chunk of its fleet. In addition, the surging oil price will cause Spirit problems with jet fuel costs going forward.\n\nEssentially, the company is running out of any financing options. Spirit already spends $130 million in interest payments annually, and its roughly $300 million in expected annual losses will increase this figure by $45 million annually through 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. Though its $4.40 shares look “cheap” on certain valuation metrics, Spirit’s onerous financing costs means the stock will unlikely survive for much longer.\n\n5. SunPower (SPWR) a phone with the sunpower logo in front of a U.S. flag\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, solar financing stocks will likely underperform as long as rates stay high. These companies rely on cheap borrowing rates to offset the large upfront installation costs, and elevated interest rates make large projects less attractive. Residential customers are particularly sensitive to these changes, since the viable alternative (of using grid energy) already exists.\n\nThe most notable of these residential solar suppliers set to fail is SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), a company Jeremy Flint recently called a sell at InvestorPlace.com:\n\nThe residential rooftop solar sector is notoriously difficult to penetrate, with tons of high-quality companies competing for an increasingly shrinking pool of interested homeowners. At the same time, high upfront and financing costs are cutting into sales across the industry. Both factors are pushing SunPower’s stock down and, staking claim to less than 1.5% of the total existing market, SunPower has a long way to catch up to top competitors\n\nThat’s because SunPower was already weak to start. In 2022, the firm earned just $58 million net income on $1.7 billion of sales. The firm would lose $160 million the following year, and management believes it will lose another $120 million this year. Tesla’s energy generation and storage segment generates gross profits a third higher.\n\nOther solar firms have also struggled. Louis cut his remaining stake in Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) last November to book a 54% total gain (subscription to Accelerated Profits required). A resurgence in cheap Chinese imports is also harming Western panel makers.\n\nBut according to my analysis, SunPower’s precarious start makes it the most likely solar company to fold within the next three years. Flint is right: In this new rate environment, it’s better to bet on the top competitors than the stragglers.\n\nThe Cost of Debt Keeps Going Up\n\nThe average S&P 500 firm has now seen its cost of debt rise 9.3% since the start of 2024, according to estimates from Thomson Reuters. Though the U.S. Federal Reserve hasn’t raised its benchmark rate since last August, all firms must eventually roll low-rate borrowings into higher-rate ones as loans mature.\n\nThat can have disastrous effects, especially on highly leveraged firms. Spirit Airlines, for instance, has $1.1 billion in bonds due next year. It will either need to find a willing suitor or sell enough of itself to make up the difference. Shareholders will face significant dilution.\n\nEven healthy firms can see their share prices fall, as high-flying firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have recently shown.\n\nThat’s why Louis has teamed up with a special guest for the Election Shock Summit. During that event, they show us what to do before we learn, on May 1, that there may be no rate cuts any time soon. This is going to usher volatility back into the market of the sort we haven’t seen in years.\n\nPlus, they’ll show you how to access a new system that lets you get ahead of big “unpredictable” political, economic, and financial moves before they happen.\n\nGo here to watch the replay.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 14 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe US stock market is going through a pullback as optimism around rate cuts fades. The AI-led rally that boosted stock valuations over the past few months caused several analysts to advise caution and expect a pullback. In this backdrop, value vs growth stocks debate has resurfaced as many financial experts believe that with the era of zero interest rates behind us, value investing is set to come back with a vengeance. Since 2007, growth crushed value as low interest rates and economic growth urged investors to pile into risky stocks. However, things changed in 2022 when the Fed decided to begin its battle against inflation. As a result, the MSCI World Growth Index declined 30% in 2022, compared to a decline of about 8.5% for MSCI World Value. But growth came on top again in 2023 when the AI revolution started that benefitted major stocks like  Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHigh Interest Rate Environment to Last \"Not Months, But Years\"\n\nWhile higher rates had caused a worry for many, some analysts welcomed the new era where easy money is no longer available. For example, Vanguard in a report published in December 2023 said that the return of \"sound money\" was part of a \"structural shift\" in the market. Vanguard called this change the \"single best economic and financial development in the last 20 years.\" Vanguard in its report made some prescient comments that are proving true as the Fed continues to grapple with the inflation problem and a  \"higher for longer\" scenario becomes a possibility:\n\n\"Barring an immediate 1990s-style productivity boom, a recession is likely a necessary condition to bring down the rate of inflation, through weakening demand for labour and slower wage growth. As central banks feel more confident in inflation’s path toward targets, we expect they will start to cut policy rates in the second half of 2024. That said, we expect policy rates to settle at a higher level compared with after the GFC and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vanguard research has found that the equilibrium level of the real interest rate, also known as r-star or r*, has increased, driven primarily by demographics, long-term productivity growth, and higher structural fiscal deficits. This higher interest rate environment will last not months, but years. It is a structural shift that will endure beyond the next business cycle and, in our view, is the single most important financial development since the GFC.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts Say Buy Stocks from Undervalued Sectors in 2024\n\nIn this changing economic backdrop, more and more analysts and experts are recommending investors to pile into undervalued stocks with strong growth potential and fundamentals.  T. Rowe Price earlier this year said in a report that while tech stocks saw a huge run in late 2023, defensive areas such as healthcare, utilities, among others, were \"left behind\" as the market's focus was more on momentum instead of fundamentals. This is about to change, according to T. Rowe, as the firm said it sees \"pockets of opportunity\" in these industries over a five-year horizon.\n\nPerformance and Returns of Investing in Undervalued Stocks\n\nInvestors are indeed paying heed to this advice, since latest data shows that both hedge funds and corporate insiders are piling into banks, healthcare and utilities stocks. WisdomTree Low P/E Index (WTLPE), which tracks the performance of large-cap US stocks with low P/E ratios and positive earnings, is up 4.25% year to date in 2024, and 14% over the past one year.  The fund is invested mostly in defensive industries, with a heavy tilt towards financials, healthcare and utilities. Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify penny stocks with low P/E ratios having Buy or better ratings from Wall Street analysts. From this list we chose 14 stocks that have the highest upside potential from their current price based on average analyst price targets.\n\n14. Origin Materials Inc (NASDAQ:ORGN)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$2.23\n\nUpside Potential: 260%\n\nCarbon-negative materials company Origin Materials Inc (NASDAQ:ORGN) is one of the cheap penny stocks with upside potential. Analysts on Wall Street expect the stock’s price to reach around $2.2, while its current price is $0.62.\n\n13. Five Point Holdings LLC (NYSE:FPH)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$12\n\nUpside Potential: 279%\n\nFive Point Holdings LLC (NYSE:FPH) develops mixed-use and planned communities in California.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, 14 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Five Point Holdings LLC (NYSE:FPH). The biggest stakeholder of Five Point Holdings LLC (NYSE:FPH) was Christian Leone’s Luxor Capital Group which owns a $32 million stake in Five Point Holdings LLC (NYSE:FPH).\n\nThird Avenue Real Estate Value Fund stated the following regarding Five Point Holdings, LLC (NYSE:FPH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Furthermore, Five Point Holdings, LLC (NYSE:FPH) (a U.S.-based land development company) launched an exchange offer for its Senior Unsecured Notes, whereby it proposed to pay down $100 million of principal, while also extending the maturity date on the remaining amount to 2028 and introducing an optional amortization feature. The offer was accepted by more than 99.0% of the holders, thus allowing the company to move forward with the well-designed transaction that will further reduce debt and grant Five Point more flexibility as it seeks to unlock the value embedded in its incredibly scarce land positions—an amount that seems much more significant than currently implied by the prevailing price for its common stock, in Fund Management’s view.\n\nThe Fund participated in several of these developments, primarily by (i) increasing its position in Ingenia Communities alongside the Sun Communities offering and (ii) agreeing to engage in the Five Point exchange offer, which is expected to close in January 2024. The Fund also increased its position in Sun Communities during the period and trimmed back certain holdings for portfolio management purposes.”\n\n12. Spar Group, Inc  (NASDAQ:SGRP)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$7\n\nUpside Potential: 291%\n\nMerchandising and brand marketing services company Spar Group, Inc (NASDAQ:SGRP) shares have been on an absolute tear this year, up 77% through April 15. Earlier this month Spar Group, Inc's (NASDAQ:SGRP) board approved a share repurchase program of up to 2.5 million of Spar Group, Inc's (NASDAQ:SGRP) shares of common stock. Unlike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which are highly popular among hedge funds, Spar Group is a small company with low hedge fund sentiment.\n\n11. Sound Group Inc ADR (NASDAQ:SOGP)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$14.53\n\nUpside Potential: 332%\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Sound Group Inc ADR (NASDAQ:SOGP) is an audio platform company. The stock jumped earlier this year after Sound Group Inc ADR (NASDAQ:SOGP) launched new AI-powered applications for the international market.\n\n10. Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$7.5\n\nUpside Potential: 357%\n\nMasschusset-sbased Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) shares have gained about 7% year to date through April 15. Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) is working on treatments for rare and infectious diseases.\n\n9. Scynexis Inc (NASDAQ:SCYX)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$6.88\n\nUpside Potential: 374%\n\nScynexis Inc (NASDAQ:SCYX) is one of the notable cheap penny stocks to buy according to analysts. The stock is not having a good year after GSK amended its license agreement with Scynexis Inc (NASDAQ:SCYX) for its antifungal drug Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp tablets). However, some analysts say Scynexis Inc (NASDAQ:SCYX) has a strong cash runway and catalysts that make it an undervalued play. Unlike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), SCYX is a small company but the stock has high upside potential.\n\n8. S&W Seed Co (NASDAQ:SANW)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$2\n\nUpside Potential: 376%\n\nAgricultural products company S&W Seed Co (NASDAQ:SANW) is one of the cheap penny stocks analysts like. Based on its average analyst price estimate, the stock has an upside potential of 376%. Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds shows that five funds had stakes in S&W Seed Co (NASDAQ:SANW) as of the end of 2023.\n\nDuring its earnings call in February, the company talked about guidance and future plans:\n\n\"For the year we continue to remain on target to achieve our stated goal of $11.5 million to $14 million of Double Team sales more than doubling our revenue from last year and don’t forget our gross margins on Double Team are approximately 65% which will be a key driver of future bottom-line improvement. Beyond our sorghum trait technology portfolio, another key value driver is our agreement with Shell to develop Camelina as a feedstock for biofuels, which Shell has a take-off agreement to develop green diesel SAF jet fuel production. We successfully achieved all the stated objectives required of VBO, and received the $6 million payment from Shell on February 6, 2024. As a reminder, the total paid to S&W inclusive of cash payments and repayments of a loan on the Napa facility was $20 million from Shell.\"[read the full earnings call transcript here].\n\n7. Fundamental Global Inc (NASDAQ:FGF)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$7\n\nUpside Potential: 383%\n\nFundamental Global Inc (NASDAQ:FGF) was formed earlier this year as a result of the merger between FG Financial Group (NASDAQ:FGF) and FG Group Holdings (NYSE:FGH). Fundamental Global Inc (NASDAQ:FGF) offers services like reinsurance, asset management, merchant banking, manufacturing and managed services.\n\n6. Greenland Technologies Holding Corp (NASDAQ:GTEC)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate:$9.5\n\nUpside Potential: 385%\n\nIndustrial vehicles and power systems company Greenland Technologies Holding Corp (NASDAQ:GTEC) is one of the cheap penny stocks to buy according to analysts.

        "title": "The 3 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks to Buy for Massive Potential",
        "content": "Despite being inherently volatile, there are no shortages of tech stocks with long-term potential in the market. Technology is constantly evolving, after all. We only have to look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) as recent examples.\n\nThe question, then, is how to choose tech stocks to hold long-term. Looking back on my investing career, which started in 1996, I find myself with a portfolio containing stocks that I’ve held for more than a decade. And yes, research is typically the best way to find such companies. However, I understand not everyone has the time to get into the nitty-gritty.\n\nThankfully, I know a few relevant categories to filter tech companies with good growth potential, strong financial performance, and a clear vision of their future. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo come up with a shortlist of stocks, I screened for stocks with:\n\nNet income growth comparison from four years ago (above 30%) Analyst ratings (Strong Buy only)  One-year positive EPS growth\n\nThese metrics give me a good indication of how these companies might perform in the future. However, nothing is set in stone, and past performance does not equate to future results (even though that’s how investment advisors sell their products.)\n\nRambus (RMBS) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne tech stock on my radar is the semiconductor company Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ:RMBS). The company’s business portfolio is quite diverse, and it produces different types of tech products with all sorts of practical applications in the present and the future, contributing to its overall long-term potential.\n\nThe company’s productions include:\n\nMemory interface chips (DDR5 and DDR4) are sold to module manufacturers, OEMs, and hyperscalers. Silicon IP solutions for data movement and protection in advanced applications across data centers, government, and more. Security IP solutions include hardware roots of trust, high-speed protocol engines, provisioning technologies, and a patent portfolio covering memory architecture, high-speed serial links, etc.\n\nRambus has recently launched a $50 million accelerated share repurchase program with the Royal Bank of Canada, which shows its confidence in its long-term growth strategy.\n\nThe company will receive an initial delivery of approximately 675,000 shares, with the final number determined by the average price during the transaction. The program is expected to conclude by the end of this year’s Q1.\n\nAside from repurchasing shares, Rambus’ FY23 report showed relatively decent improvements across key metrics. Revenue reached $461.1 million, increasing from $454.8 million last year. The bottom line is even more impressive— $3.01 per diluted share, as opposed to negative 13 cents per share last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRambus also registered a 42.76% 4-year net income growth rate. Given their perfect “Strong Buy” recommendation, analysts consider RMBS one of the more attractive long-term tech stocks.\n\nOSI Systems (OSIS) biotech stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother tech stocks worth your attention is OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS). The company has been doing a pretty good job establishing market dominance with its multiple business segments, as evidenced by its four-year net income growth of 322.45%.\n\nOSI Sytems’ main segments are:\n\nSecurity (Rapiscan and S2): Offers inspection systems for baggage, parcels, cargo, and vehicles, as well as people screening, radiation monitoring, and explosive detection, along with related services. Healthcare (Spacelabs): Provides patient monitoring, cardiology, and other solutions for medical settings. Optoelectronics: Supplies optoelectronic devices, electronics manufacturing services, LCD displays, and flex circuits to industries like aerospace, defense, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to the company’s business segments, OSI Systems’ security division recently secured an international deal worth $100 million.

        "title": "10 Best Password Managers in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 best password managers in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Password Managers in 2024.\n\nOverview of the Password Manager Market\n\nPassword management software helps in the process of securing and managing passwords throughout the life-cycle of a password from its creation to termination. Password management service providers use internally encrypted vaults to protect private credentials while following strict ethical standards. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global password management market was valued at $1.74 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28.52% during the next five years to reach $7.32 billion by 2029. Two main factors driving growth for the market are the vast shift towards remote work after the pandemic and the subsequent increase in demand for password management software by small and medium businesses to protect their online business operations. Moreover, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest growth rate. According to a report by Acumen Research and Consulting, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 23% from 2022 to 2023. The growth in the region is attributed to its large number of emerging small and medium enterprises in economies including China, India, and Japan.\n\nWhile the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow the fastest, it also remains one of the most cyber threat-prone areas, accounting for 31% of the global cybersecurity threats in 2022. Regional governments are taking steps to protect key companies from being hacked. On February 26, Reuters reported that China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology revealed its cybersecurity plan to protect the industrial sector by 2026. The plan aims to conduct around 30,000 data security training sessions and appoint 5,000 data security engineers to protect over 45,000 Chinese companies during the said period.

Viable estimates of the data breach cost help organizations achieve better risk management and optimize security investments, leading to a smooth strategic decision-making process. According to the Cost of a Data Breach Report by IBM Security, the average cost of a data breach increased by 2.3% in 2023, reaching an all-time high of $4.45 million. From a longer-term perspective, the average cost has continued to increase at an accelerated pace since COVID-19, which has increased by 15.3% from $3.86 million in 2020. As a result of this increment, 51% of the leading organizations worldwide are planning to increase their security investments to deter future cyber threats. To read more about cybersecurity trends you can look at Cybersecurity Trends: Top 10 ETFs For Cyber Defense and 15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncorporating security artificial intelligence and automation techniques is one protection mechanism that leads to higher cost savings during a breach. Security AI and automation help identify a breach faster and lead to quicker containment of the threat. According to the report by IBM, organizations using extensive security AI and automation were able to contain data breaches 108 days quicker than those with no use. Moreover, companies using these technologies incur 39.3% less in costs for a data breach than those with limited or no use of modern technologies.\n\nLeading Cybersecurity Companies\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.

        "content": "Nvidia initiated, AMD upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nHSBC upgraded AMD (AMD) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $225, up from $180. The firm thinks AMD has enough supply capacity and demand to surpass management's artificial intelligence revenue guidance. UBS upgraded Rivian Automotive (RIVN) to Neutral from Sell with an unchanged $9 price target. The near-term risk-reward on the stock has become more balanced at current levels as shares now price in about $4.5B in 2025 sales vs. consensus that stands still at $7.5B, the firm says. Wells Fargo upgraded Kroger (KR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $65, up from $58. The firm has turned bullish on Kroger, saying the company's fundamentals look poised to improve and catalysts are building. Argus upgraded Goldman Sachs(GS) to Buy from Hold with a $465 price target. The company's Q1 results demonstrated the considerable strengths of the Goldman franchise during an investment banking upturn, the firm tells investors in a research note, stating that while the investment banking environment offered a few false rebounds in 2023, the current surge appears to have staying power as equity and debt underwriting showing sequential improvement. Barclays double upgraded Tyson Foods(TSN) to Overweight from Underweight with a price target of $69, up from $53. Though Tyson has faced its share of challenges in recent quarters, the company is now in position to turn its performance around, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank downgraded Honeywell (HON) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $215, down from $227. Deutsche finds it is hard to gain conviction in the company's second half of 2024 implied revenue ramp. Baird downgraded Berry Global (BERY) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $65, down from $68. The firm says a second inflation pulse\" is taking hold led by crude oil, and Berry's \"poorly received\" decision to separate the Health and Hygiene Products segment from the portfolio via a commensurate merger \"derails the purity\" of its exposure towards improved consumer personal goods volumes. Barclays downgraded Pilgrim's Pride(PPC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $38, up from $35. While the firm expects the company to deliver strong gains for both sales and earnings in 2024 and 2025 due to the strength of chicken, it believes the stock's current valuation levels \"have started to track above historical averages.\" DA Davidson downgraded Encore Wire(WIRE) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $295 after the company entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Prysmian will acquire Encore Wire for $290 per share in cash. Truist downgraded Snap One(SNPO) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $10.75, down from $12, following the announcement of the $10.75 per share takeout offer from Residio (REZI). The firm sees \"a very limited chance\" of another bidder and thus sees little further upside in the shares. JPMorgan also downgraded Snap One to Neutral from Overweight.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nEvercore ISI initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Outperform rating and $1,160 price target. The firm thinks investors underestimate the importance of the chip, hardware and software ecosystem that Nvidia has created, and contends that computing eras last 15-20 years and are \"typically dominated by a single vertically integrated ecosystem company, whose returns are measured in 100-to-1000 bagger range.\" Evercore also started Broadcom (AVGO), Astera Labs (ALAB), GlobalFoundries (GFS), Analog Devices (ADI), ON Semiconductor (ON), ASML (ASML), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Texas Instruments (TXN), Lam Research (LRCX), Arm (ARM), AMD (AMD), and Applied Materials (AMAT) with Outperform ratings, and Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) with In Line ratings. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of DraftKings (DKNG) with a Buy rating and $60 price target, implying 36% upside. The firm expects DraftKings to compound revenue at 20%-plus as it continues to benefit from \"healthy growth\" in existing states, as well as future state legalizations across online sports betting and internet gaming. Goldman Sachs also started coverage of Genius Sports (GENI) with a Buy rating and $7.50 price target. Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Reddit (RDDT) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm thinks Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections, saying its top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the advertising platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, and the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth. Meanwhile, BofA started coverage of Reddit with a Neutral rating and $46 price target. Benchmark initiated coverage of Penn Entertainment(PENN) with a Hold rating and no price target. While the firm has concerns about the ability of ESPN Bet to significantly influence the U.S. online sports betting market, it also thinks these issues are already reflected to \"some degree\" in the company's current valuation and contends that given the \"diminished valuation\" that shares could see a potential valuation reset if ESPN Bet can gradually capture a material market share. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Buy rating and $154 price target. The firm is optimistic on the company's position in helping the world electrify and decarbonize.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Startup Rivos raises $250 million to develop RISC-V AI chips",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Chip startup Rivos said on Tuesday it raised $250 million in a funding round that will enable it to manufacture its first server chip geared for artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia's combination of chips and CUDA software dominates the market for AI-related computing, and Nvidia gobbled up more than 80% market share of AI chips in 2023. But a host of startups and chip giants have started to launch competing products, such as Intel's Gaudi 3 and Meta's inference chip - both unveiled last week.\n\nRivos is tight-lipped about the specifics of the product, but has disclosed that its plans include designing chips based on the RISC-V architecture, which is an open source alternative to the architectures made by Arm, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Instruction set architectures such as RISC-V are the building blocks of semiconductor designs, and using the open source alternative means Rivos does not have to pay a license fee to Arm.\n\n\"RISC-V doesn't have a (large) software ecosystem, so I decided to form a company and then build software-defined hardware - just like what CUDA did with Nvidia,\" said Lip-Bu Tan, founding managing partner at Walden Catalyst, one of Rivos' investors.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Rivos is in the process of designing a server chip that combines a central processing unit and AI accelerator component that will be optimized for large language models and data analytics. The company began with the software necessary to compile computer code to allow the chip to run a program and designed the processor around the software.\n\n\"Usually the chip companies do it the other way: build the silicon, and then build the software on top,\" CEO Puneet Kumar told Reuters in an interview. \"We decided, as a company that we should first look at software.\"\n\nMatrix Capital Management was the largest investor in the funding round that also included investments from Intel, MediaTek and Dell Technologies.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Silicon Valley chip developer Rivos Inc. raised more than $250 million as it works toward bringing out its first product, underscoring the push for new hardware to meet the needs of artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Beyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI US Two-Year Yield Eyes 5% Before Powell’s Remarks: Markets Wrap IMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning Debt Iran’s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on Edge\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company said Tuesday that Matrix Capital Management is the largest investor in the latest round, with new backers including Intel Capital and Taiwan chip design firm MediaTek Inc. participating.\n\nRivos is betting on demand from AI users that don’t need the costliest and most powerful chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. to run their services. The company targets customers using data analytics and generative AI, seeking to capitalize on the rising popularity of AI following the advent of ChatGPT.\n\n“We can target potentially smaller installations where Nvidia might seem like an overkill from a cost perspective,” Rivos co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Puneet Kumar said in an interview. “We can go in with a solution that works well enough and can compete quite well.”\n\nRivos’s chip uses the open-standard RISC-V, a design competing with Arm Holdings Plc, Kumar said. He declined to give details of its chip structure, timeline for product releases, or the startup’s valuation.\n\nThe company plans to use the fresh funds to pilot produce chips using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s 3NE process technology, among the most advanced in mass production. TSMC’s strategic partner VentureTech Alliance was an existing investor in Rivos and took part in the latest round, along with Walden Catalyst, Dell Technologies Capital, and Koch Disruptive Technologies.\n\nLip-Bu Tan, the founding chairman of Rivos and early backer, said RISC-V has strong long-term potential especially in data analytics and generative AI applications. Tan, the former chairman and CEO of chip design software company Cadence Design Systems Inc., has been an investor in several key chip startups sold to Amazon.com Inc., Qualcomm Inc., and Intel Corp. He is on the board of Intel.\n\nKumar was previously part of the team at P.A. Semi Inc., a chip design firm acquired by Apple Inc. as the iPhone maker started to make its own chips. He started Rivos in 2021. Apple sued Rivos in 2022, claiming trade secret theft. Rivos sued back, saying the tech giant forces employees to sign restrictive agreements that prevent them from working elsewhere, stifling up-and-coming companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, Apple said it reached an agreement to settle the case, paving the way for the new funding round.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This ETF Has Crushed the Markets and Even the Tech Sector: Don't Let Fearmongers Keep You Out",
        "content": "Investors love their long-term gains, but short-term investors can't stand volatility. And that very fear on the part of shorter-term-minded investors, particularly people nearing retirement, can potentially offer huge opportunities for investors with a long-term mindset.\n\nThe best-performing sector in the market over the past 10 years offers such an opportunity. While many investors often stay away from this sector due to its extreme booms and busts, over the long term, it has actually provided superior long-term gains.\n\nDon't let the fearmongers and naysayers keep you out. The sector remains a long-term winner.\n\nThrow your chips in with the chips\n\nThe sector in question is the semiconductor sector. Looking at the performance of one low-cost exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the chip sector, the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX), one can plainly see how chip stocks, in aggregate, have crushed the broader market, even outperforming the general technology and software sectors over the past 10 years.\n\nThe broader S&P 500 has appreciated 176% over the past decade, giving long-term shareholders a nice return well above the rate of inflation. Of course, with strong innovations in cloud computing, e-commerce, smartphone applications, and now artificial intelligence (AI), the technology sector has rallied much more.\n\nThe tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ: QQQ), meant to closely reflect the Nasdaq 100, has appreciated 408% over that time. Within the tech sector, the super-high-growth cloud software sector has pushed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF(NYSEMKT: IGV) an even higher 413%.\n\nBut that all pales in comparison to the semiconductor sector, which has rallied a whopping 742%! That's nearly double the returns of the overall technology sector and over 4.2 times the return of the broader market over the past decade. SOXX Chart\n\nWhy many shy away from the chip sector\n\nIn light of the semiconductor sector's long-term outperformance, it may be surprising that many investors shy away from it. After all, Warren Buffett had never once bought a semiconductor stock until he purchased Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) in late 2022, only to sell it all within two quarters over geopolitical fears.\n\nThe refrain by many Buffett acolytes and value investors, in general, is that the chip sector moves too quickly, with fast-changing technology making long-term competitive advantages somewhat hard to identify or more breach-able by the competition.\n\nThere is some truth to this; after all, just look at how Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and foundry partner TSMC have overtaken Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), which used to be regarded as the sector's undisputed champion a mere decade ago. Now, Intel has suddenly fallen far behind in a relatively short amount of time and is attempting an ambitious turnaround for its very survival.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that's the beauty of buying an ETF. With an ETF, you are betting on the industry's long-term growth with a diversified mix of winners and losers. Eventually, the winners rise to a top-weighting, buoying result. Young and investing? Don't ignore the semis. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow have semiconductors done it? It's more than just AI\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, the chip sector had basically appreciated in line with the broader software sector for the first six years or so of the past decade and only began to do a bit better than the Nasdaq around late 2020, when the chips started to separate from the pack.\n\nYes, the technology sector began to take off in earnest during the pandemic, as companies ran to cloud computing to keep their businesses going, and consumers purchased new laptops and smartphones with stimulus checks for the stay-at-home economy. That benefited software, the internet, and semiconductors alike.\n\nHowever, late in 2020 and into 2021, separation began to happen -- even before the thunderous debut of ChatGPT in late 2022. Why was that?\n\nI think it was due to a renewed investor focus on stock valuations as inflation and interest rates began to pick up from rock-bottom levels. In that period, software valuations tended to be much higher than those of chip stocks, as software is thought to be more of a stable \"recurring\" subscription business, and chip sales can fluctuate year to year.\n\nHowever, rising interest rates lower the present value of earnings far out in the future. That tends to depress the valuations of high-multiple stocks such as software.\n\nOn the other hand, semiconductor stocks tended to trade at lower valuations, especially back then. Many chip leaders are also dividend payers and share repurchasers on top of their tech-powered growth. Those shareholder returns only add to the sector's long-term numbers.\n\nAnd while semiconductors overall may not grow as fast as, say, cloud software, semiconductors are still holding their own in terms of long-term growth. While the sector may boom and bust in any single year, the overall sector is projected to grow at an 11.6% annualized growth rate over the 2023 to 2030 time period, according to DataHorizzon Research.\n\nSo, starting from a lower valuation with a lower hurdle to clear may have been a key factor behind the sector's outperformance as interest rates normalized.\n\nIt's not just Nvidia\n\nOf course, many may scoff at the sector's rise as the work of Nvidia alone. As the first-mover in graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for generative AI applications, Nvidia's stock has taken off over the past two years. And with AI being a potentially transformative technology to society and humanity, Nvidia has become the poster child of success.\n\nBut it's actually not just Nvidia driving the gains in the sector. In fact, seven of the 10 best-performing S&P 500 stocks over the past decade are all in the semiconductor sector, encompassing four of the top five.\n\nProducing leading-edge chips with billions of tiny transistors is difficult, and past cycles have allowed the chip sector to consolidate into a handful of exceptional companies with these unique technological capabilities. As such, it's perhaps no surprise that not one but a handful of stocks all participating in AI chip design and manufacturing ecosystem would reap the rewards.\n\nWhile the chip sector may not achieve the gains in the next 10 years that it did over the past 10, owing to higher starting valuations, our world only appears to be getting more automated, intelligent, and connected. All of that is powered by semiconductors. And that still makes this ETF a must-have for any ETF investor with a time horizon beyond 10 years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the technology landscape. Its potential to improve productivity recently led JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to write, \"We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformative as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years.\" He specifically mentioned the discovery of electricity and the invention of the internet.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, investors have been ploughing money into chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a sensible move given that its graphics processing units \"underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, Nvidia shares have soared 480% since the beginning of 2023, and Wall Street analysts now see more upside in other AI stocks like CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). The median price estimates (and the implied upside) for those companies are as follows:\n\nNvidia: $976.95 per share (15% upside). CrowdStrike: $400 per share (29% upside). Snowflake: $210 per share (36% upside).\n\nHere's what investors should know about CrowdStrike and Snowflake.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Sales increased 33% to $845 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to hit $0.95 per diluted share. The company also reported a gross retention rate of 98%, indicating that it kept the vast majority of its customers. Investors can expect similar momentum in the future.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley recently noted that CrowdStrike was one of only three enterprise software companies to guide for sales growth exceeding 30% this year. That speaks to the pressing demand for cybersecurity software that is both effective and operationally efficient. CrowdStrike checks both boxes. It is the market leader in endpoint security, one of the largest and fastest-growing market segments, and it's gaining share in other categories.\n\nSpecifically, in the fourth quarter, the company reported record revenue from its identity protection, cloud security, and security information and event management (SIEM) products. Management also highlighted early momentum with its data protection and IT operations modules.\n\nI mention those products not only to explain the clout CrowdStrike has achieved, but also to highlight the breadth of its platform. Many enterprises rely on more than 60 security point products, according to CEO George Kurtz, so vendor consolidation has become a top priority. Using products from vendors typically translates into greater efficiency, simply because there are fewer systems to maintain, and CrowdStrike is ideally positioned to capitalize on that trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, CrowdStrike has earned a reputation for industry-leading threat protection, in part because of excellence in artificial intelligence (AI). Kurtz recently told analysts that CrowdStrike has the \"most effective and accurate AI models.\" That comment echoes what Frost & Sullivan analysts wrote in 2022: \"CrowdStrike leads the industry with regard to the application of artificial intelligence/machine learning to endpoint security, as well as providing unparalleled prevention of malware and malware-free attacks.\"\n\nNotably, CrowdStrike ranked No. 3 on the Fortune Future 50 list in 2023, an annual assessment of the world's largest companies based on long-term growth prospects. Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 29% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 24.7 times sales seem reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nData analytics specialist Snowflake reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Its customer count rose 22% and the average existing customer spent 31% more. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $775 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to reach $0.35 per diluted share. But guidance narrowly missed expectations and CEO Frank Slootman announced his retirement. That alarmed investors and caused shares to tumble 20% following the report.\n\nHowever, the investment thesis remains unchanged. The Snowflake Data Cloud consolidates workloads, such that clients can store and analyze information, develop and manage machine learning models, and build data-driven applications from a single platform. The platform also runs across all three major public clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. None of those vendors afford customers the same flexibility.\n\nCollectively, Snowflake has earned a strong market presence due to its ability to consolidate workloads and support multiple clouds. Indeed, Forrester Research recently recognized its leadership among cloud data warehousing platforms, noting that Snowflake has outpaced its peers in terms of innovation. Snowflake also ranked No. 1 on the Fortune Future 50 List for 2023.\n\nOne particularly exciting growth opportunity is artificial intelligence. To quote new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, \"Data is the fuel for AI, making it essential to establishing an effective AI strategy.\" Snowflake recently announced Cortex, a service that lets clients develop generative and predictive AI applications on its platform. Cortex includes large language models for translation, sentiment detection, and text summarization, as well as machine learning models for forecasting, anomaly detection, and data classification, all of which streamline the creation of AI applications.\n\nGoing forward, the data analytics market is forecasted to grow at 27% annually through 2030. Wall Street analysts believe that tailwind will drive sales growth of 25% annually for Snowflake. Against that consensus estimate, the current valuation of 18.1 times sales seems reasonable. To add context, Snowflake is essentially trading at its cheapest price-to-sales multiple in history, which arguably means there has never been a better time to buy this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The investment world is buzzing with talk of artificial intelligence (AI), soaring stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and the immense possibilities for other companies. Hey, I am, too -- if you have a minute, take a look at this stealthy AI stock you may have never heard of. But, while everyone is looking one way, it can pay handsomely in the long run to also look elsewhere.\n\nI look for a few criteria in companies to invest in. These include positive cash flow, stock buyback programs, growing revenue, and desirable business models. Booking Holdings(NASDAQ: BKNG) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) check all the boxes for me.\n\nIs Booking Holdings a good investment?\n\nThe travel industry is back in full force with the COVID-19 pandemic finally abating. Forecasts expect $927 billion in global travel spending this year and continued growth thereafter, as depicted below. Travel industry statistics\n\nMany people prefer to book directly with the hotel or airline, but others take advantage of sites like Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, and Agoda, all owned by Booking Holdings. A recent study by Self Finance showed that travelers often save significantly on hotels and flights by using third-party booking services, especially when bundling them. Booking also owns the popular restaurant booking app OpenTable and offers short-term rental stays. The company's massive presence in the travel industry is great news for investors.\n\nBooking's business model is excellent. Since it is essentially a software platform with few physical infrastructure needs, the company spends very little on property and equipment, just 1.5% of revenue in 2023. Amazon, which requires trucks, warehouses, and data centers, spent 9% of its revenue on capital expenditures last year and even more in prior years.\n\nThis lean business model allows Booking to generate a 33% free-cash-flow (FCF) margin -- for each revenue dollar, $0.33 goes right into the company's pocket. Over the last 12 months, Booking recorded $7 billion FCF in sales of $21 billion. And Booking doesn't hoard the cash; it returns it to shareholders through stock buybacks. As you can see below, it spent over $10 billion in just over two years, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 15%. BKNG Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nI prefer buybacks to dividends because buybacks aren't taxed to the investor annually like dividends are. Buybacks reduce the outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share and the stock price. This also means that if the stock falls, the company can take more shares off the table for the same investment -- a terrific cushion for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30, ahead of Expedia Group's P/E of 24; however, Booking has reduced its average diluted shares outstanding by 15% since January 2022, compared to 6% for Expedia. Booking also posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 compared to just 10% for Expedia.\n\nIt all adds up to Booking being an excellent long-term investment.\n\nIs The Trade Desk stock a good buy?\n\nAdvertising in 2024 is much different than in prior decades because there are so many mediums to consider, like mobile video ads, website displays, and connected television (CTV). CTV refers to any television content streamed through the internet. Advertising on streaming television is essential; The Trade Desk reports that 95% of advertisers will maintain or increase their programmatic CTV budgets in 2024. This will benefit demand-side platforms (DSPs) like The Trade Desk tremendously.\n\nProgrammatic advertising works like this: When a user visits a website or watches a streaming program, the publisher requests bids on the ad space. A DSP like The Trade Desk bids on behalf of its customers and tries to match them with the target audience. It happens instantaneously. Since 2019, the amount advertisers spent using The Trade Desk's platform tripled from $3.1 billion to $9.6 billion, while The Trade Desk's revenue grew from $661 million to $2 billion.\n\nLike Booking Holdings, The Trade Desk is a lean business that is growing FCF and revenue, as depicted below. TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company instituted a stock buyback program in 2023 and used $647 million to repurchase shares. The Trade Desk is a younger company and is more high-risk and high-reward than Booking. The stock trades for 22 times sales, which is on the high side, although less than its five-year average. The high valuation is due to the excellent business model, growing industry, and the company's opportunities for expansion. Right now, only 11% of The Trade Desk's revenue comes from outside North America; however, 67% of the world's advertising dollars are spent elsewhere. This is fertile ground for growth. The company is also making inroads with retail advertising, including deals with Walmart, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Target.\n\nGiven the rich valuation, rushing into a full position with The Trade Desk stock is unnecessary. Consider buying a little at a time to take advantage of dips in share price. This is called dollar-cost averaging, and it's excellent for hedging risks.\n\nThe Trade Desk and Booking operate in different industries but share many characteristics that make them attractive long-term investments. If you're looking outside the world of AI, you should consider these two candidates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and The Trade Desk wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $540,321!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Market conditions improved significantly in Q4 of 2023 due to a slowdown in inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy. Looking ahead to 2024, there is potential for a soft landing as the central bank aims to slow economic growth to curb inflation without causing a recession.\n\nAI emerged as the most promising investment theme in 2023 and so far in 2024. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the top-performing tech stocks, exhibited robust performance with a staggering 265% revenue growth in Q4 of 2023. It has substantially benefited from the recent tech industry’s focus on large artificial intelligence models. Analysts believe that the AI-driven market is in its early stages and foresee significant potential in the coming years, driven by advancements in productivity and AI technology.\n\nIn March 2024, the three major stock indexes experienced an outstanding surge, each reaching unprecedented closing levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 401.37 points, closing at 39,512.13. Simultaneously, the S&P 500 broke the milestone of 5,200 for the first time, marking an increase of 0.89%. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite surged by 1.25%, settling at 16,369.41. The Federal Reserve has also reaffirmed forecasts for three rate cuts by the end of 2024. However, inflation remains stubborn and the Fed might not be able to remain on its planned course.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 10 Largest Stock Exchanges in the World.\n\nGlobal Stock Market Outlook 2024 and Top Performers\n\nAccording to the April issue of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global stock market valuation, defined as the market cap of all listed companies across the globe, reached $111.85 trillion in February 2024, recording a moderate growth of 1.48%. As of February 2024, there are 54,625 total domestic and foreign listed companies in the global stock market. In February, trading activity showed strong growth, with the number of trades reaching over 4.34 trillion.\n\nOn April 1, Forbes reported that the US stock market experienced a strong first quarter in 2024. In March, the S&P 500 recorded total returns of 3.2%, driven by the positive outlook of the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average grew by 6.1% and NASDAQ grew by over 9.3% in the first quarter of 2024. Sectors including technology, consumer cyclical, and consumer defensive fueled the market growth in the first quarter, generating total returns of over 8% or more, each.\n\nAmong the best-performing S&P 500 stocks for the quarter, the leading AI server manufacturing company, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) exhibited strong performance and led the market by a substantial margin, recording a 255% year-to-date increase. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has recorded a noteworthy return of 502% since the start of 2023. Another leading company manufacturing AI chips, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has maintained its strong growth in 2024 so far, after being the top-performing S&P 500 stock of 2023. The company's market cap reached $2.29 trillion in the first quarter of 2024. This can be attributed to a year-to-date surge of 82% and a 321% increase since the beginning of 2023 in NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also among the 10 unstoppable tech stocks to buy now.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making huge moves in AI and investors and analysts are bullish on the stock. Over the past 3 months, the stock has received 39 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Its average price target of $989.5 represents an upside of 15% from current levels. As of April 5, the stock has returned over 215% over the past 12 months. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Fund said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Such beguiling prognostications are indigenous to Wall Street—the biggest showcase of them all. The ferocious march higher of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock on expectations of its continued dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) chips might even confound the galley slavedriver in Ben-Hur. Ramming speed!\n\nNvidia’s share price seems to imply the firm will soon control nearly the entire global semiconductor market (over half a trillion in sales vs. Nvidia’s current $60 billion) while maintaining an operating margin of 54%—unprecedented for a hardware company. Leading hardware firms rarely retain their supremacy forever: IBM, Hewlett Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel, and Cisco all fell from their storied perches…”\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). On March 25, Northland Capital Markets analyst Nehal Chokshi raised the price target on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) to $1,300 from $925 and maintained an Outperform rating. Over the past 3 months, the stock has received 7 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“While large cap benchmarks get a lot of attention for a handful of mega cap stocks driving the lion’s share of performance, we would highlight even more extreme and unprecedented concentration in small cap benchmarks. Year to date, one stock, Super Micro Computer, Inc.(NASDAQ:SMCI) has driven 37% of the return of the benchmark.\n\nCurrently, SMCI is the largest constituent by weight in our benchmark, and it peaked at over 4.5%, representing the largest individual security weight in a monthly dataset going back to 1985. That represented a weighting 83% higher than the second-largest weight (from 1999). Moreover, MicroStrategy at its peak this past quarter would have represented the fourth-largest security in the 38 years of the monthly dataset. We are hard-pressed to recall another instance where the largest constituent of our benchmark was also added to the S&P 500, as SMCI was this March. We would note that SMCI currently is a $61 billion market capitalization company and MicroStrategy boasts a market capitalization of $28 billion, both well above the $6.8 billion weighted average market cap of the Strategy.\n\nEnthusiasm for AI and bitcoin have fueled this atypical concentration and performance distortion. Bitcoin rallied fast and furiously following the SEC’s approval of the first bitcoin ETF in early January, while the AI infrastructure build-out has had a narrow set of beneficiaries. Against this backdrop, the ClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy underperformed its benchmark. We are disappointed by this result, although 79% of the relative underperformance was due to not owning these two large benchmark holdings, which have fundamental and governance factors that have caused us, as long-term investors focused on quality sustainable growth stories, to avoid them.”\n\nYou can also look at the 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket and 11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution.\n\nEuropean Stocks Tumble After Strong Q1\n\nOn April 5, Reuters reported that the European market witnessed a significant decline after a strong first quarter, amid hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official, reversing the bullish sentiment that led to gains in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn April 4, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari appeared at a virtual LinkedIn event where he was asked about the expected rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Reserve official expressed his shock over the economy's resilience despite the rising interest rates. He further added that with significant growth in the job market, GDP, and consumer spending, we might not need to cut rates. He said:\n\n\"Maybe the dynamics that we have right now are actually sustainable. But, you know, there are a lot of ifs underlying that question and that hypothesis or that scenario that I just articulated. So we need to see what ultimately happens with both the labor market and with inflation. Our dual mandate ultimately is what drives our rate path.\"\n\nThe idea floated by the Fed official doused hopes for interest rate cuts and led to the stumbling of European stocks on April 5. The STOXX Europe 600 (.STOXX) declined 1.2% and reached its lowest since mid-October 2023. Benchmark indices across the major European countries including DAX Performance Index, FTSE MIB Index (.FTMIB), and IBEX 35 (.IBEX), declined by over 1% each.\n\nThe drop can also be attributed to the ongoing Middle East crisis. The increase in Brent crude prices and the suspicions regarding supply disruption, led to a 1.8% drop in the travel and leisure stocks, the STOXX 600 Travel & Leisure PR Index (.SXTP), followed by a decline of around 1% and more in other indices and stocks.\n\nIncreased Foreign Capital and Investments in Asian Stocks\n\nThe impact of the Fed official's remarks about no rate cuts, led to major declines in the Asian stock market. However, the first quarter of 2024 presented a great outlook for the stock market in the region. On April 5, Reuters reported that Asian stocks surged in March, driven by the increased traction from foreign investors. The quarter was recorded as the best for foreign investments over the past three years, fueled by expectations of relaxed monetary policies and economic growth in the region, specifically China. According to the stock exchange data across India, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, foreign investors bought a total of $8.53 billion of regional equities in March. The total inflow for the quarter reached $18.57 billion, recording the highest investments since December 2020.\n\nNow that we have discussed the stock market outlook for 2024 and talked about the major markets, let's have a look at the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world. 30 Largest Stock Exchanges in the World\n\nA successful investor looking at the stock market performance on a digital device.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world, we utilized the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) market statistics for stock exchanges.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best machine learning stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the machine learning industry, go directly to the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably. However, that is not the case as machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data, make predictions, and automate tasks without explicit programming. On the other hand, artificial intelligence includes a broader range of techniques that aim to create systems capable of human-like intelligence, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global AI market was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2023 and 2032, reaching $2.575 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Precedence Research estimated machine learning's market value at $38.11 billion in 2022 and expects it to reach $771.38 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 35.09% over the projected period, between 2023 and 2032.\n\nCompanies Leveraging Machine Learning\n\nWhile there are a handful of companies that are actively working on developing products toward the advancement of machine learning, there are many companies that depend on machine learning technology to run their operations. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) leverages machine learning to influence content creation decisions and personalize the user interface. Moreover, the company’s recommendation system uses ML to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions. Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to deliver tailored content experiences to its subscribers drives user retention and platform growth. The company made the following comments in one of its articles:\n\n“At Netflix, the Machine Learning Platform (MLP) team has been investing in research to push the boundaries of ML Performance over the years. Our state-of-the-art ML performance infrastructure serves as a strong foundation to leverage the latest research in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Infrastructure, GPU Memory Management, Graph Neural Networks, and more recently Large Language Models. We are building an increasingly active engagement with Academia and have a quickly growing graduate ML Internship program that brings us both new talent & the latest research, providing a bridge between university labs and fast-growing industry applications.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial services institution, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been using AI/ML for over a decade. In the company’s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon said that the company now has over 2,000 AI/ML experts and data scientists. Dimon considers AI an “extraordinary” technology and believes that it is “as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years” such as electricity and the internet. He said:\n\n“We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.”\n\nHe further added that the organization understands the importance of AI and for that reason, it has created a new position, chief data and analytics officer.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia in the AI Space\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the markets by storm and was the top-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2023, gaining nearly 240%. The surge was attributed to limited competition in the AI accelerator market. However, other companies have been making strides to take over NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). On April 9, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled its new AI chip, Gaudi 3. According to the company, the chip is “purpose-built for high-performance, high-efficiency GenAI compute”. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that compared to NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100, Gaudi 3 is much more power-efficient and faster.\n\nOn April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced its new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), an upgrade to MTIA v1 that was introduced last year. The chip has been designed for Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) in-house AI workloads, and to decrease its dependency on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The new MTIA version more than doubled the compute and memory bandwidth while maintaining a focus on efficiently serving recommendation models. According to the company, MTIA is part of its long-term plan to build a strong and efficient infrastructure for handling its AI tasks.\n\nWith the above information in mind, some of the best machine learning stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\nA researcher studying a machine learning model of a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through internet rankings of AI stocks and ML stocks, including our own, in addition to the holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) to come up with 25 potential ML stocks. We then looked into each company's products and services to further refine our list to include AI companies that are actively working toward the development and advancement of machine learning. We narrowed down our selection to 13 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\n13. Baidu, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META).\n\nAriel Investments stated the following regarding Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“By comparison, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) traded lower alongside Chinese equities as intensifying problems in China weighed on investor sentiment during the period. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently launched its generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”\n\n12.

IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "7 Strong Chip Stocks to Buy Not Named Nvidia",
        "content": "Mention potential chip stocks to invest in and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is likely the first name that springs to mind. That’s for good reason: Nvidia is a dominant force in artificial intelligence and its chips are in high demand. It also seems you can’t read a headline about the stock market that isn’t somehow connected to the company. However, there are plenty of other strong chip stocks to buy not named Nvidia.\n\nSome of those stocks represent firms that are vital suppliers to Nvidia and other chip manufacturers. Others represent firms in direct competition. Still, others represent a mix of suppliers and competition.\n\nWhatever the case, there are many strong choices for chip stocks for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world, if not the most important companies overall. Its stock is the largest foundry globally and a vital link in the supply chain.\n\nMany semiconductor firms rely on a business model known as fabless manufacturing. Such firms design their hardware and chips, manufactured by foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor being the largest.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes roughly 90% of the world’s advanced chips. It is responsible for the cutting-edge, advanced AI chips that firms, including Nvidia, make.\n\nThe company made a bullish call on chip manufacturing demand early this year, forecasting 20% revenue growth. That call immediately spiked shares by more than 10%, and they have since risen by an additional 30%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn’t command the impressive multiples that Nvidia does, but analysts believe it can continue growing at its present price.\n\nMicron (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) suffered more than almost any other chip stock throughout the past few years. Pandemic chip shortages hit the specialized memory chip manufacturers particularly hard. Firms over-ordered Micron chips, a supply glut caused demand for those chips to crater, and the company suffered huge operating losses in 2023.\n\nMicron generated operating losses for the first time in over a decade in 2023. Then, suddenly, the fortunes of the company changed.\n\nThe company’s specialized high bandwidth memory (HBM) is in high demand. It has applications for the artificial intelligence chips that firms demand. It also began producing HBM, which will be used in Nvidia’s H200 chips.\n\nThe company’s HBM products remain in high demand. Most of its 2025 capacity is already booked. HBM allows artificial intelligence chips to perform better, so investors should keep their eye on MU shares. Demand is sky-high, which can still push share prices higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the very best positioned chip stocks available to investors today. It is, of course, the primary challenger of Nvidia’s dominance. It has emerged as such a potent competitor because Its chips are nearly as powerful as those from Nvidia yet cost a fraction of the price.\n\nThus, AMD represents the best bang for your buck in the AI chip landscape. Are enterprises willing to risk investing in AMD chips over Nvidia’s? Leading chip purchasers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI have each announced plans to use AMD’s MI300X AI platform.\n\nHowever, the answer is not that simple. AMD’s newest platform boasts better specifications than Nvidia’s H100 platform. Nvidia is releasing its H200 platform soon. Comparison is, therefore, muddled. Further, Nvidia has stronger software, which is particularly important in AI applications.\n\nOverall, AMD has a chance to compete with Nvidia, although it is not a clear-cut case. It’s why investors should continue to bet on AMD.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another integral link in the advanced chip manufacturing supply chain. The company monopolizes advanced lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. Essentially, no other firm can replicate the products it produces, giving it a near monopoly.\n\nA lot has been said about those extreme ultraviolet lithography machines it produces and their importance overall. While that is integral to its story, let’s look at another less covered factor.\n\nASML has been identified as one of 18 European equivalents to the U.S. Magnificent 7 stocks. UBS (NYSE:UBS) handpicked the Dutch company as one with the potential to outperform significantly. It should be a relatively easy choice for American investors, given that ASML is a tech firm. It is, therefore, very similar to the Magnificent 7, which relies heavily on technology.\n\nAI demand is going to continue to grow. That means ASML’s EUV machines will continue to be in high demand as the cutting edge fabrication machines that they are.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has performed well this year, rising from $140 to $175. That strong performance is paradoxical because the company’s fortunes are generally tied to phone sales.\n\nDemand for expensive handsets is lagging currently. Consumers continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are more hesitant to purchase phones that can easily cost north of $1,000. Qualcomm is a major supplier of cell phone chips, and thus, should struggle.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm is not. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Gen 8 and Snapdragon Gen 8S chips drive the generative AI on the phone market. The company is iterating its generative AI features down throughout the price range of cell phones. Those chips were first applicable to high-end models and, in time, will bring generative AI capability to lower and lower-range models. It is easy, then, to see why QCOM stock makes so much sense at this time: People spend increasingly more time on their phones and AI opportunities therein are massive.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), like Qualcomm, is a reliable stock choice for chip stocks investors. Both firms include dividends that signal overall reliability. That isn’t the primary reason for considering investing in Broadcom, but I wanted to mention it.\n\nThe bigger and more important reason is that Broadcom is an integral chip firm and part of the overall AI opportunity. The company develops infrastructure software solutions for semiconductors. Basically, Broadcom helps chip firms derive greater AI output from the same quantity of power.\n\nThe company is also thriving fundamentally. During the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 34%, reaching $11.96 billion. The company repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock and eliminated them. Broadcom is also known to hike its dividends annually.\n\nAVGO Stock is an excellent choice for more conservative investors looking to exploit the AI boom. While Broadcom doesn’t benefit from outsized valuation multiples like Nvidia, its impressive growth is very attractive.\n\nSkyworks (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip supplier that derives a significant portion of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIt is similar to Qualcomm, an integral chip supplier to the iPhone maker. Like Qualcomm, Skyworks stock currently includes a dividend yielding 2.6%.\n\nThe application of generative AI to handsets is still nascent. That’s arguably the best reason to consider Skyworks at the moment. It derives a significant portion of its sales from cell phones. As that market grows, so should company-wide opportunities. Skyworks is positioned to grow with that emerging market.\n\nInvestors should also note that there are potential pitfalls despite Skyworks’ overall strength.  Apple continually makes efforts to bring chip production in-house. Qualcomm has served as an excellent example of that truth.  The risk that Apple walks away is one that the company continually has to navigate.\n\nYet, Qualcomm has proven that it is difficult for Apple to do so. Thus, the overall opportunity for Skyworks seems to be strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks in April.\n\nJim Cramer has been sharing his thoughts about the latest market pullback on his programs on CNBC. Last week, Cramer said that after major wins stocks tend to decline and that’s exactly what happened recently when winners saw sharp declines on April 10 when the market saw a “tough session” for the winners, but not so much for the losers. Cramer said that it’s “astonishing” that how some of the “great stocks” got “pummeled” while “sub-par performers” of the last year “finally had their day in the sun.”\n\nCramer Talks Nvidia VS Intel\n\nCramer talked about some stocks he liked that recently saw a pullback, including NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY). Cramer said part of the reason why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell was concerns that the competition for the chip company might be heating up with Intel launching its new chips. Intel has revealed its AI-focused chip called Gaudi 3, and the company claimed it's faster than Nvidia’s H100 GPU. Cramer said that when he read about Intel’s latest chip, he “gulped” until he read the claims Intel made about Gaudi 2 back in 2022. Cramer said that if he hadn’t been “well versed” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), he would have been “tempted” to sell NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares back in 2022 when the stock was trading at just $175. At that time, Intel made claims that its new chips had twice the training throughput of Nvidia A-100 chips. But, according to Cramer, Intel’s Gaudi 2 chips failed to make any waves. However, Cramer said that it’s possible that Intel’s Gaudi 3 is faster than Nvidia’s chips in some \"categories\" but by the time this chip reaches market, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have launched its “much, much faster” Blackwell.\n\nJim Cramer said that in the Nvidia versus Intel battle, it’s not just about the chips.\n\n“It’s the software, it’s the ecosystem, it’s the platform, it’s the leadership.”\n\nCramer said Gaudi 3 would likely be “as useless as” Gaudi 2.\n\nCramer Thinks Nvidia Stock Could Fall in the Coming Days\n\nJim Cramer, however, said that he’s no longer saying “buy, buy, buy” for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) since there’s a chance the stock would fall if Google unveils its own chip. But Cramer said his advice for investors when it comes to Nvidia is to “own it, don’t trade it.” Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks in April\n\nJim Cramer's Thoughts on Elon Musk\n\nIn another program, Jim Cramer talked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and how the media becomes all the praise for the billionaire when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are going higher. But when the stock nosedives, like it is in 2024 (down 33% so far), news outlets grill Musk and criticize his personality, his handling of Twitter and Tesla cars. Cramer said that he thinks Elon Musk is “brilliant” and calling him an “evil genius” is “unfair.” Cramer also talked about how the media uses Elon Musk’s name to gain more “eyeballs” and “page views.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk is back in the news on April 15 morning after The Wall Street Journal reported the billionaire, in an email to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) employees, announced to cut 10% of the global workforce.\n\nMethodology For this article, we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired in April so far and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy and hold.\n\n10. Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nJim Cramer thinks the US government’s pause on LNG expansion until 2028 is not going to hold, which is why he recommended buying Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE) for the long term. Cramer thinks Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE) is going to “fly” if the US government reverses its decision to halt LNG projects expansion, which, according to Cramer, is one of the “dumber” things the current administration has one.\n\nLast month, during an earnings call, the company talked about guidance:\n\n\"For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $315 million and $335 million. As Steven mentioned, the fixed fee revenues from our FSRUs and terminals create an exceptional foundation for sustainable growth. As part of our financial plan this year, we expect to see an increase in business development expense as compared to last year as we advance on our commercial growth opportunities that Steven referenced earlier. These business development costs, which are estimated about $20 million are included in our guidance range and will be reported within our selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement. Also included in our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance is the impact of a planned first quarter dry dock for the FSRU summit LNG.\n\nThis vessel is our second FSRU that is under a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer or BOOT structure and provide services in Bangladesh. Because this FSRU is under a BOOT structure, the related expenses will not be classified as maintenance CapEx, but instead, the financial impact of the dry dock will be recognized on our income statement in the first quarter of 2024.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that US government’s pause on LNG terminal expansion is hurting New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE). Cramer said he “likes” New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE). He thinks the pause is “outrageous” and believes LNG is “great for energy security” and for “our allies.”\n\n8. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nJim Cramer hit “buy, buy, buy” button on PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) in a latest program when he was asked about the Pennsylvania-based financial services company. Cramer said he does not understand why the stock is down. Cramer praised PNC Financial Services Group Inc's (NYSE:PNC) 4% dividend yield and said you should buy some PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) shares now and then buy more next week if the stock goes down after earnings. In addition to PNC, Cramer is also talking about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) during his shows these days.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Banks were well represented among our top Q4 performers as the Treasury market rally drove big gains in the bank stocks. US Bancorp (USB), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and Bank of America—the three banks we hold in the portfolio—were each among our top five contributors to return. When bank stocks sold off in Q1 due to fears of contagion following Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, we took advantage of the market dislocation by purchasing top-10 US banks USB and PNC at what were, in our view, cheap prices. USB and PNC are banks we have known for years. They are well managed and well capitalized. As large banks, they were less impacted by the turmoil that affected smaller institutions as depositors sought the safest places to store their money. The recent rebound is an example of how our approach of investing in out-of-favor businesses can lead to alpha. USB and PNC are not immune from industry-wide headwinds from higher deposit costs, pressured net interest margins and fleeing deposits. However, we did not see these banks having a similar level of risk, with respect to uninsured deposits and unrealized losses, which contributed in varying degrees to the collapses of other banks in March 2023. As investors, we cannot avoid risk. However, we are willing to take risk if we are being compensated appropriately.”\n\n7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWhile giving positive comments about power generation company Cummins in his latest program, Cramer also pitched PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), the Washington-based large commercial trucks company. Earlier this year Cramer had called PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) a “true innovator.”\n\nLike PCAR, Jim Cramer is also talking about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\n6. Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about power generation and engines company Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI). Cramer hit the buy button for the stock and said he likes the stock “very much.” The company talked about guidance and future plans during a latest earnings call:\n\n\"We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023.\n\nWe have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims.\" [Read the full earnings call transcript here].\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks in April.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Microsoft, NVIDIA, Twilio, Meta Platforms and Zscaler",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 15, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Twilio TWLO, Meta Platforms META and Zscaler ZS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 A.I. Stocks with Ample Growth Potential in 2024\n\nThe year 2024 has thus far proved to be a landmark for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, propelled by the technology's rapid growth and accelerating adoption across myriad industries. From healthcare revolutionizing drug discovery and patient care to finance harnessing AI's predictive prowess to manufacturing and optimizing processes with machine learning, AI's disruptive influence cast a broad footprint.\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global artificial intelligence market size is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. It is projected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030.\n\nVarious companies are implementing AI-based solutions such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to enhance the process workflows to handle and automate repetitive tasks. AI-based solutions are also being coupled with IoT (Internet of Things) to provide robust results for various business processes.\n\nThe AI in hardware market is poised for remarkable expansion, projected to swell from $20.88 billion in 2023 to $25.96 billion in 2024, exhibiting an impressive 24.3% CAGR. This trajectory is anticipated to persist, with the market forecast to reach $58.61 billion by 2028, maintaining a robust 22.6% CAGR. Key trends expected to shape this period encompass the accelerated pace of urbanization, further dissemination of internet connectivity, the continued evolution of smart city infrastructures, a rising appetite for self-driving vehicles, and an intensifying need for cloud-based computing capabilities.\n\nGenerative AI and AI-related startups have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations. Anthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.\n\nGartner estimates 240 million GenAI smartphones and 54.5 million AI PCs will be shipped worldwide by the end of 2024, representing 22% of all PCs and basic and premium smartphones, respectively. PC shipments are also expected to grow 3.5% in 2024, while smartphone shipments are expected to grow 4.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid the fervent AI boom, shareholders have been hunting for the pioneers and visionaries adept at monetizing AI's capabilities to deliver both ground-breaking innovation and substantial returns.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nHere, we have picked four tech stocks, NVIDIA, Twilio, Meta Platforms and Zscaler, which, apart from boasting strong fundamentals, have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a perfect mix of elements offer solid investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is a leader in AI technology, particularly in the development of GPUs used for machine learning and AI applications. With its continuous innovations in AI hardware and software, NVIDIA stands poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across various sectors, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and more. Last week, NVIDIA forged a partnership with Indonesia's telco firm PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to build an artificial intelligence (AI) center in Central Java in 2024.\n\nNVIDIA’s Blackwell platform promises to power a new era of computing by enabling organizations worldwide to build and deploy real-time generative AI models on an unprecedented scale. With a focus on efficiency, performance and scalability, Blackwell aims to address the evolving needs of industries ranging from data processing to generative AI. Manufactured using a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, Blackwell GPUs feature two-reticle limit GPU dies connected by a high-speed chip-to-chip link, enabling unprecedented computational power.\n\nNvidia sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA’s 2024 earnings has moved north by 2.6% to $23.72 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 83.02%.\n\nTwilio has enhanced its Flex platform with new features like Unified Profiles and Agent Copilot to improve customer support departments by boosting efficiency and productivity. Unified Profiles, powered by Twilio Segment, enables clients to access native data layers for personalized interactions. Agent Copilot uses this data, along with AI, to help employees automate tasks and work more efficiently. The new features will use AI to reduce costs associated with traditional engineering methods for merging and utilizing data.\n\nThe company has been rapidly expanding in the AI space through partnerships and product launches. Amazon and Twilio collaborated to enhance the latter’s platform with predictive AI technology. The two companies combined Amazon SageMaker technology and Twilio Segment’s Customer Data platform to enable TWLO’s clients to better understand their customers. Twilio, alongside Google Cloud, aimed to incorporate generative AI into its Flex and Customer Engagement platforms.\n\nTwilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for the company’s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.4% to $2.64 per share over the past 60 days, which indicates a 7.76% increase from 2023.\n\nZscaler, a pioneer in cloud security, has announced a groundbreaking advancement in AI innovations through its acquisition of Avalor. This move underscores ZS' commitment to fortifying its platform with cutting-edge capabilities. This collaboration empowers enterprises to automate AI-driven analytics and decision-making in real-time, streamlining reporting, incident mitigation and advanced threat detection within the Zscaler cloud security platform.\n\nZscaler Zero Trust SASE is the industry’s first single-vendor SASE solution, which is built on the company’s Zero Trust AI. It helps organizations cut down on costs and simplify security by implementing the Zero Trust measures for users, devices and workloads.\n\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A at present.

The move signals how Meta plans to tap massive user bases across its various apps to scale its AI offerings.\n\nMeta unveiled Meta AI, its general-purpose assistant, in late September. The AI chatbot is designed to answer user queries directly within chats, as well as offer them the ability to generate photorealistic images from text prompts. In collaboration with Microsoft, Meta unveiled the next generation of Large Language Model Meta AI (“Llama”), called Llama 2. The social media giant also released Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. The company confirmed earlier this week that it will be launching Llama 3, the next version of its open-source LLM, within the next month.\n\nMeta Platforms currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2024 earnings has been revised 1.1% upward to $20.03 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 34.7%.\n\nThe potential growth in the AI sector is substantial, and these companies stand out for their innovative AI solutions, making them compelling choices for investors eyeing the burgeoning AI market in 2024.

        "title": "Insider Scoop: Why AMD Stock’s Explosive Growth Is Just Getting Started",
        "content": "Considering Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) valuation, buying shares now may not seem like the optimal move. However, the company’s positive outlook warrants further evaluation, especially its balance sheet strength. In 2023, AMD’s diverse performance saw notable growth in Data Center revenue, driven by AMD Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen EPYC CPUs, up 38% year-over-year in Q4.\n\nExpectations for Q1 2024 include revenues of around $5.4 billion, with significant growth projected in Data Center GPU revenues to exceed $3.5 billion for the year and a gross margin of approximately 52%.\n\nWall Streets Sees More Upside for AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices stock capitalized on the surge in artificial intelligence adoption, launching its MI300X processor. With an 84% gain, analysts foresee further potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaird analysts reiterated a bullish outlook on AMD, maintaining their buy rating and $200 price target, suggesting a 17% potential upside. While reports indicate a reduction in orders for AMD’s MI300X chips, Baird says it might be due to over-ordering, similar to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) experience. It anticipates a comfortable upside to AMD’s revenue guidance, fueled by the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nManagement’s guidance for the first quarter appears conservative. Forecasting flat year-over-year revenue at $5.4 billion underestimates demand for AI.\n\nIn addition, AMD’s momentum from sequential to year-over-year growth in Q4 also gives confidence to analysts and investors. AMD is currently among the most undervalued growth stocks, signaling a buy movement for those who want to invest in the company.\n\nPartnership with Blackberry\n\nOn April 9, Blackberry (NYSE:BB) announced a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices stock that will enhance the performance and reliability of its robotic systems in different sectors. The collaboration also aims to provide cost-effective platforms to merge Blackberry’s QNX and AMD’s Kria K26 SOM technology.\n\nBlackBerry QNX’s VP of Product & Strategy, Grant Courville, highlighted the partnership’s focus on ensuring consistent precision and responsiveness in critical robotic tasks. This capability is crucial for industries like autonomous mobile robots and surgical robotics.\n\nBlackBerry’s stock rose 5.6% to $3.04 on April 9, while Advanced Micro Devices saw a 0.6% decline. Despite recent bearishness, shares are up nearly 22% for the year.\n\nExpanding Portfolio\n\nAMD introduced the Versal Series Gen 2, its latest adaptive SoC technology, including the Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2. These advancements significantly boost AI-driven embedded systems, offering up to three times higher TOPs-per-watt and up to 10 times more scalar computing. AMD aims to meet the growing demand for AI-enabled embedded applications while addressing power and area constraints.\n\nStory continues\n\nVersal Series Gen 2 devices find broad application across industries like automotive, aerospace, and healthcare. Subaru Corporation’s adoption of Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 for their EyeSight system showcases its potential in enhancing vehicle safety.\n\nWith FPGA logic for preprocessing, AI inference processors, and Arm CPU cores for postprocessing, these devices streamline design and potentially reduce time-to-market.\n\nBuy AMD Stock in a Heartbeat\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices stock has become a significant contender in the AI chip market, driving investor interest. Beyond surface-level enthusiasm, AMD’s potential for substantial growth is evident in CEO Lisa Su’s forecast of a $400 billion AI data center chip market by 2027.\n\nAnalysts suggest this projection could triple AMD’s price to the low $500s, making it a compelling investment. I tend to agree, and think this is a stock long-term chip investors should consider adding on any significant dips.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +402.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +84%. This estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.20 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $24.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +236.1%. The $105.87 billion and $124.77 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +73.8% and +17.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%. The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Like Nvidia Stock but Prefer ETFs? This Is the Best Semiconductor ETF to Invest In Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Other Megatrends.",
        "content": "In 2024, the global semiconductor (or chip) market is projected to grow more than 13% to nearly $600 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Moreover, this market should reach $1 trillion in revenue by 2030, per top consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These rosy growth projections are being driven by several massive global trends that are in their early innings, including artificial intelligence (AI), vehicle electrification, and autonomous driving, according to McKinsey.\n\nBuying Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is one way to gain exposure to these trends. The company's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips have a dominant share of the data center AI market, whose growth has greatly accelerated due to generative AI. (This is the tech behind OpenAI's incredibly popular chatbot, ChatGPT.) And while Nvidia's auto business is still relatively small, it has the potential for huge growth once driverless vehicles become legal across the United States and beyond.\n\nSome investors are understandably hesitant to buy Nvidia stock after its rapid run-up. The stock has soared 233% and 480% over the last year and three years, respectively, as of April 12. One great way to get considerable exposure to this top-performing stock but with less risk than buying it is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is heavily weighted with Nvidia stock: VanEck Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SMH).\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: The best-performing semiconductor ETF\n\nAmong semiconductor ETFs with at least a three-year trading history, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has the best returns over the short, medium, and longer terms.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF began trading in December 2011, so it has a solid track record, at least compared other semiconductor ETFs. It's easily outperformed the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the overall U.S. stock market) over the short, medium, and longer terms, as shown below.\n\nETF/Index Year-To-Date 2024 Return 1-Year Return  3-Year Return 5-Year Return 10-Year Return VanEck Semiconductor ETF 26.2% 77.4% 78.4% 305% 1,030% S&P 500 7.9% 27.2% 30.1% 91.6% 240%\n\nData source: YCharts. Data as of April 12, 2024.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: The basics\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an index fund that's designed to track the performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. This index consists of a portfolio of worldwide companies involved in the semiconductor value chain -- from chip design and production to the manufacturing of equipment used for making chips. As this index's name suggests, it has 25 stock holdings and all the stocks are listed on a major U.S. stock exchange.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a positive that the index upon which this ETF is based favors large companies, in my view. Large companies in the semiconductor space benefit from economies of scale, including usually having greater bargaining power with suppliers and subcontractors than their smaller peers.\n\nThis ETF has a reasonable total expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: Top 10 stock holdings\n\nHolding No.  Company Market Cap  Wall Street's Projected Annualized EPS Growth Over Next 5 Years Weight (% of Portfolio)* 5-Year Return 1 Nvidia $2.2 trillion 37.9% 20.39% 1,770% 2 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) $739 billion 4.3% 12.70% 282% 3 Broadcom $623 billion 14.4% 7.93% 398% 4 ASML Holding  $378 billion 21.7% 4.93% 401% 5 Micron Technology $136 billion (2.6%) 4.72% 197% 6 Qualcomm $191 billion 8.3% 4.68% 240% 7 Applied Materials $173 billion 14.3% 4.51% 410% 8 Lam Research $125 billion 9.4% 4.50% 428% 9 Texas Instruments  $151 billion 10% 4.47% 63.7% 10 Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) $264 billion 25% 4.04% 486% Total Top 10 N/A N/A N/A 72.87% N/A Overall ETF N/A Total net assets of $18.8 billion N/A 100% 305% N/A S&P 500 N/A N/A N/A 91.6%\n\nData sources: VanEck Semiconductor ETF, Yahoo! Finance, and YCharts. EPS = earnings per share. *Portfolio weight as of April 11, 2024. All other data as of April 12, 2024.\n\nThe 10 top holdings above fall into these broad categories:\n\nChip producers: Nvidia (No. 1), Broadcom (3), Micron (5), Qualcomm (6), Texas Instruments (9), and Advanced Micro Devices (10). Foundries: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2). TSM produces chips for companies that contract out some or all their chip manufacturing. Nvidia is one such company. It's a so-called \"fabless chip maker\" because it doesn't do any of its chip fabrication in-house. Indeed, Wall Street analysts estimate that Nvidia was TSM's second-largest customer in 2023. So TSM is benefiting significantly from Nvidia's incredible growth. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers: ASML (4), Applied Materials (7), and Lam Research (8).\n\nWhat data pops out at you in the above table other than the stock performance data? Perhaps one or both items:\n\nLargest holding: Nvidia is not only the ETF's largest holding, but it is by far the heaviest weighted. This is a positive if you want considerable exposure to this top-performing stock, but are hesitant to buy it for whatever reason. That could include being concerned it's run up too quickly and is overvalued, or you might simply prefer investing in baskets of stocks within an industry rather than in individual stocks. Best projected earnings growth: Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are projected by Wall Street analysts to have the best average annual earnings growth over the next five years. These two companies are the No. 1 (by far) and No. 2, respectively, producers of discrete GPUs. GPUs are the favored chips for training artificial intelligence models and running AI applications in data centers. Given the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities, it makes sense that Nvidia and AMD have the highest consensus earnings estimates.\n\nA great ETF for investing in the AI and other humongous global growth trends\n\nThe semiconductor industry is poised for decades of strong growth, thanks to several humongous global growth trends that are in their early stages, including AI, the electrification of the world's vehicle fleet, and autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an attractive way for investors to invest in these trends. Its diversification makes it a less risky way to gain exposure to the chip space, relative to buying individual stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Stocks Analysts Are Loving Right Now (And You Should Too): April 2024",
        "content": "Many investors have one or more preferred fundamental or technical indicator. These help to cut through the noise surrounding a stock. And, in some cases, the opinion of analysts is one of those indicators. Analyst-backed stocks have a high correlation with future stock price growth.\n\nAnalysts have access to information, and corporate insiders, that individual investors like you and me do not. They also generally follow many stocks within a sector, giving them the ability to spot emerging bullish or bearish trends. When analysts upgrade a stock or maintain a rating of Buy (or one of its equivalents such as Overweight or Outperform), it tells you that analysts have a strong belief that the stock will move higher.\n\nThat kind of information brings clarity. And that clarity is essential in times when economic indicators are sending conflicting signals. Here are seven analyst-backed stocks with several analyst upgrades in the 30 days ending April 10, 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Micron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) leads this group of analyst-backed stocks with 22 upgrades. Many of the upgrades are above the stock’s consensus price target of $121.35.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of memory chips that are becoming essential as companies add artificial intelligence (AI) functionality. AI models require a tremendous amount of data, which then requires high bandwidth memory (HBM). And Micron continues to be a leader in the HBM sector. As evidence of that, the company’s newest solution, the HBM3E will be embedded into the new Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 graphic processing unit (GPU).\n\nMU stock is up 92% in the last year which may explain why short interest is up more than 9% in the last month. But with bullish analyst sentiment acting as a tailwind, any pullback can set the stage for the next move higher.\n\nThe next catalyst for Micron is likely to come from their earnings report in June. That makes this a good time to take a position as the stock is giving you a small pullback.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NASDAQ:S) is another of the top analyst-backed stocks with eight recent upgrades. Cybersecurity will continue to be one of the top sectors for investors in 2024. Much of that demand is being driven by AI. So, it stands to reason that SentinelOne’s AI-driven cybersecurity solutions will be in demand.\n\nThat’s certainly the sentiment of analysts from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that upgraded SentinelOne from a Neutral to a Buy with a $35 price target in February in support of the company’s competitive positioning, which has to do with its leadership in AI-based cybersecurity.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentinelOne is not turning a profit, yet. And at a time when investors have less of an appetite for the risk that comes with those stocks, the company closed that gap significantly last year and expects to close it even more in 2024.\n\nLike many tech stocks, S stock has had a sharp pullback in the last 30 days. But with analysts giving the stock a consensus price target of $29.96, investors have the potential for 32% upside. And 19 out of 32 analysts give SentinelOne either a Strong Buy or Buy rating.\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Williams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nI recently put Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) on a list of stocks to buy based on bullish analyst calls, and it’s worth repeating my bullish call here. Although analysts put a consensus Hold on WSM stock, the company has received 12 upgrades in the 30 days ending on April 10, 2024.\n\nOn the one hand, market bears can say that, even with 12 upgrades, WSM is still a Hold. On the other hand, the company beat on earnings every quarter in 2023 even though the earnings were lower year-over-year. And that speaks to the idea that Williams-Sonoma can still command the 20.1% operating margin that it reported in its March earnings report.\n\nWSM stock has pulled back about 5% the week of April 8. That’s likely some profit taking as investors come to grips with any rate cuts moving further down the calendar in 2024, if they arrive at all. But this is a company with a more affluent target market that is more able to manage through inflation.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs you might expect, several energy stocks – and specifically oil and gas stocks – have been getting upgrades. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is one of the stocks that should be on investors’ radars with six analyst upgrades.\n\nOccidental is a favorite of Warren Buffett who continues to invest heavily in OXY stock. At the end of 2023, Buffett owns over 25% of the company’s stock. The legendary investor believes in the company’s turnaround story and in how Occidental is well positioned to deliver value to shareholders. That value is becoming clear in the company’s dividend. After cutting the dividend in 2020, the company has raised its quarterly dividend from a penny per share in 2022 to its current amount of 22 cents per share.\n\nIt’s fair to point out that Buffett likes OXY for its sustainability initiatives as well as its assets in the Permian basin. But the latter certainly doesn’t hurt. Especially as oil prices are now over $85 a barrel and likely headed higher in the next 12 months.\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another one of the heavily analyst-backed stocks with 10 recent upgrades. That’s despite an 83% gain in NFLX stock in the last year. Netflix has silenced many naysayers (full disclosure, yours truly among them) by not only retaining subscribers but growing its base.\n\nThe streaming giant has leaned into its ad-supported tier and is seeing minimal pushback as it cracks down on passwords. The cherry on top is that the company has managed to increase the rate for its premium, ad-free, tier. And it’s done so without seeing much consumer attrition.\n\nOh, and the company also signed a multi-year contract with the WWE that is the company’s first foray into the coveted live sports market. While the company says it has no long-term plans for the space, it may turn out to be too lucrative to pass up.\n\nIn fairness, since late March, NFLX stock has found firm resistance at its 52-week high. However, the company reports earnings on April 18, 2024, which could very well be the next catalyst to send the stock soaring higher.\n\nDollar General (DG) The front of a Dollar General (DG Stock) store on a sunny day.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe latest readings on inflation show that it’s moving higher. But consumers have known that, especially those that do the shopping for their household. That’s why it was surprising that the discount retailer, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) was down 29% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe key story for the company is location more than pricing. Despite its name it may not have the lowest price on items you might buy at a store like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). But the company’s business model places its stores in rural areas or in areas that are otherwise not being served by big-box retailers. That means consumers are saving money on gas as well as their purchases, which can tip the scale in favor of Dollar General.\n\nThe company has been disappointing on the earnings front as inflation hits discount retailers particularly hard. However, DG stock has 10 recent upgrades and is one of the top analyst-backed stocks. the stock is also up about 12% in 2024 which signals that sentiment could be turning around for DG stock.\n\nFor that turnaround to fully take shape may take an interest rate cut. That would be inflationary for consumers, but it may help Dollar General with its margins.\n\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) OLK Stock.

RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors who follow the biotech sector, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MDGL) has been a big winner. In March 2024, Madrigal received accelerated approval for Reziffra, the company’s treatment for adults with noncirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that includes moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. The drug must be used as part of a program that includes diet and exercise.\n\nThere are an estimated 6 to 8 million adults with NASH in the U.S. alone. And this is the first treatment for those patients.\n\nAt this time, Reziffra is only approved for NASH. But it’s important to note that a key component of Reziffra is a thyroid hormone receptor agonist, Resmetirom. Since thyroid hormones impact metabolism, if that hormone activity increases, as it will with Reziffra, patients may experience increased fat burning and weight loss. There is a high correlation between excess weight and liver disease. Resmetirom also positively influences heart-related lipids and LDL cholesterol.\n\nWill these be future indications? It’s too early to tell, but the price action in MDGL stock suggests that it may not be too early for analysts to speculate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Nasdaq Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "When it comes to Nasdaq stocks with strong buy ratings, mega-cap tech stocks may be what may first come to mind. To some extent, this is a correct assumption. Wall Street’s analyst community has issued “strong buy” or “overweight” ratings on quite a few of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.\n\nThat said, these aren’t the only Nasdaq-listed names sell-siders are bullish on right now. Many large-cap tech names have also received similarly high marks from sell-side analysts over the past few months.\n\nMoreover, remember that while heavily associated with tech stocks, scores of non-tech stocks across all sectors also trade on the Nasdaq exchange. Plenty of these names have also garnered a “strong buy” or “overweight” ratings since the start of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe accuracy of sell-side ratings has long been subject to debate. It may be worth taking a look at these lauded Nasdaq stocks, such as the following seven.\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail concept\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) is a sporting goods retailer, with stores located primarily in Texas, as well as across the southern and midwestern United States. Last year, I pointed out ASO as being one of the undervalued Nasdaq stocks.\n\nASO stock has traded sideways since then. Recent fiscal results and guidance from the company have fallen short of expectations. Yet while I’m more skeptical about the stock than before, one sell-side analyst remains very bullish. Last August, Telsey Advisory Group initiated coverage of Academy Sports and Outdoors stock.\n\nGiving ASO an “outperform” rating,” and a $72 per share price target, Telsey cited the potential for Academy to “return to growth” during 2024. The analyst firm has twice reiterated its “outperform” rating. Telsey raised its price target in the first reiteration to $83 per share, but lowered in the second reiteration to $75 per share.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\n“AI mania” has been a boon for tech stocks across the board, and Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is no exception. Shares in the cybersecurity solutions firm have rallied by a staggering 144.73% over the past year.\n\nWhile many other large and mega-cap Nasdaq stocks have outperformed it during this time frame, these massive gains for CRWD stock are nothing to sneeze at. That said, following this massive run-up, Crowdstrike shares have become pricey. Right now, CRWD trades for 81.1 times forward earnings.\n\nBut while this may have the valuation-conscious leery about entering a position, keep in mind that analysts at Raymond James have yet to reiterate or change an “outperform” rating on CRWD, issued in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe same goes for analysts at Bernstein, who also issued an “outperform” rating on the stock at that time. This could change, however, after Crowdstike next reports earnings, sometime next month.\n\nEast West Bancorp (EWBC) Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEast West Bancorp (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a California-based regional bank, focused on providing personal and business banking services to the Chinese-American community.\n\nRegional banks have contended with many challenges lately, but based on a recent sell-side rating, EWBC has been one of the more resilient names in the space.\n\nLast month, Barclays analyst Jared Shaw issued an “overweight” rating on EWBC stock, giving it a $106 per share price target. In his bullish assessment, Shaw cited management’s strong execution. Per the analyst, East West Bancorp has continued to increase its deposits and loan, all while maintaining “excellent credit underwriting” and staying well-capitalized.\n\nWith EWBC trading for around $74 per share today, reaching Shaw’s price target may seem like a tall order.\n\nHowever, if the bank’s strengths persist, macro conditions improve, and sentiment for regional bank stocks shift back to bullish, shares could hit this price target sooner than you think.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou probably don’t find it surprising that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the Nasdaq stocks getting a lot of love from the analyst community right now.\n\nThe software giant has so far been one of the early-movers in generative artificial intelligence technology. Because of this, the strong buy ratings keep coming in.\n\nFor instance, on March 20, Keybanc issued an “overweight” rating, and a $490 per share price target, on MSFT stock. In their view, “Microsoft sits in the catbird seat in two of the three main ways software vendors can monetize the AI wave.”\n\nThat’s not all. On April 11, Morgan Stanley reiterated its “outperform” rating on MSFT, raising its price target to $520 per share. In the sell-side firm’s view, Microsoft’s lead position in cloud computing and gen AI points to annual earnings doubling to $29 per share by 2029.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another “Magnificent Seven” component that’s still earning top grades from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWith the cool down in “AI mania,” investors have also cooled down in their excitement for this leading AI chip designer.\n\nThe next big move for NVDA stock may be just around the corner.. The company is expected to report earnings sometime next month. That said, if you’ve been thinking about exiting a NVDA position, a look at the latest sell-side commentary on Nvidia could change your view.\n\nLast week, Raymond James’ Srini Pajjuri maintained his “strong buy” rating on Nvidia, and raised his price target from $850 to $1000 per share. Pajjuri believes concerns about a slowdown in AI chip sales are “unwarranted,” given demand still exceeds supply.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley have also recently raised their NVDA price target to $1000 per share, as InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer discussed on April 11.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic design automation company Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is another of the Nasdaq stocks that have recently received a “strong buy” rating or the equivalent to a “strong buy” rating from analysts.\n\nOn April 4, Piper Sandler’s Clarke Jeffries issued an “overweight” rating, and a $665 per share price target, on SNPS stock. In the research note, the analyst cited several factors driving this bullish view on shares.\n\nFirst, Jeffries pointed out that the company has sustained strong levels of annualized revenue growth. Alongside this, Synopsys’ margins have improved considerably over the past five years.\n\nBesides the strong performance of its underlying business, the analyst also believes acquisitions and divestitures are also a catalyst for SNPS.\n\nThe company’s pending purchase of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) is poised to be accretive to shareholders. Synopsys’ sale of its Software Integrity Group segment stands to be a major positive for further margin expansion.\n\nWeatherford International (WFRD) Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn February 28, Barclays’ J. David Anderson issued an “overweight” rating, and a $135 per share price target, on Weatherford International (NASDAQ:WFRD). At the time, this oil equipment and services company was trading for just over $100 per share.\n\nWFRD stock has since climbed to $120 per share, but if you decide to take heed of this analyst recommendation, upside may be more substantial than you think.\n\nIn the Barclays research note, Anderson argued that the key factor pointing to higher prices for Weatherford was the company’s continued implementation of cost cutting and other efficiency measures.\n\nHowever, couple this with a recent positive development for the energy sector. That would be the latest surge in oil prices. With oil demand outpacing expectations, exploration efforts could rise as well.\n\nThis could further boost demand for Weatherford’s products and services. Hence, giving shares an organic growth catalyst, alongside a turnaround catalyst.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "content": "The massive investment underway to transition traditional computing in data centers to accelerated computing for artificial intelligence (AI) is a major catalyst for leading chip stocks.\n\nApplications using generative AI could add trillions of value to the global economy, according to JPMorgan. Here are two leading semiconductor companies supplying the hardware to make this happen.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is estimated to control 80% of the market for chips used for AI, and that lucrative position provides the company with tremendous profits to fund years of innovation. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by OpenAI's ChatGPT and all the leading cloud services. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth last year, with demand pointing to another strong year of growth in 2024.\n\nThe stock has climbed 78% just since the beginning of the year, but that's largely because investors are still catching up to the incredible growth the company is experiencing. Surging demand for its GPU systems pushed Nvidia's adjusted profit up 286% last year to $32 billion.\n\nIn March, Nvidia unveiled the new Blackwell GPU-based platform that features 208 billion transistors, providing the computing power for generative AI requirements. Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft are among some of the companies expected to adopt Blackwell.\n\nNvidia is dominating the market for AI chips because of its previous expertise in designing graphics processors used for playing video games. CEO Jensen Huang's forward thinking led the company to adapt its GPU technology to several markets, including self-driving cars, robotics, and supercomputers for AI. Its ability to adapt makes Nvidia a solid buy-and-hold investment.\n\nI wouldn't underestimate the company's ability to keep growing for many years. Wall Street analysts have been raising their growth forecast and currently expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at 35% per year on an annualized basis. With the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 36, it still offers attractive long-term return potential.\n\nMarvell Technology\n\nOne name that many investors are growing more optimistic about in the semiconductor industry is Marvell Technology(NASDAQ: MRVL). The company's products, including ethernet adapters and storage solutions, help data centers move, store, and process data. The stock has climbed 76% over the last year, as its data center business is experiencing strong demand.\n\nMarvell's revenue grew just 1% last quarter, but its data center revenue grew 54% year over year to a record $754 million, with AI revenue over $200 million. The current Wall Street estimate has the company's total revenue increasing by 42% over the next two years to reach $8.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company expects to see softness in certain markets in the near term, such as consumer applications, wireless products, and enterprise networking. But it's guiding for sequential growth in data centers next quarter. Management sees a lot of opportunities related to AI and is continuing to invest for more growth.\n\nThese results show that Marvell will be a major beneficiary of the massive ramp of investment in data center infrastructure. Data centers are rapidly upgrading components to handle the large data streams that AI training requires. Specifically, Marvell's AI-related revenue has grown from 3% in fiscal 2023 to 10% in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe forward P/E has stretched to a premium of 49, but analysts expect Marvell's long-term earnings growth to increase at an annualized rate of 26%. Like Nvidia, this is also a profitable business that is generating growing free cash flow, making the stock a solid buy-and-hold investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Hot Stocks That Will Thrive Through 2025 (and Beyond?)",
        "content": "Investors are constantly on the outlook for stocks to buy for the long-term and for the reasons to invest into those firms. It’s very simple to identify stocks that are performing well over a recent given period. It’s much more difficult to ascertain whether they will continue to rise or subsequently fall.\n\nMy strong belief is that the stocks to buy for the long-term discussed below will thrive. One reason to believe that will be the case is rate cuts. These firms have performed well even without the benefit of actual rate cuts. Once those cuts are enacted, growth is certain to ensue. Of course, they have many other catalysts investors should consider.\n\nLet’s take a look at three stocks to buy for the long-term that have the potential to thrive through 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has evolved into a well-known AI stock, but it wasn’t always that way. Before diving into AI, the company and its shares were primarily known as an intelligence software platform that was the antithesis of most things Silicon Valley.\n\nThe result was that the company was often maligned as being the tool of warmongers. As time has gone on the company has changed minds. Recent performance of the firm has a lot to do with that. 2023 was the first profitable year for PLTR on a GAAP basis. Profitability in Q4 capped its 5th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nThe company has gained a lot of notoriety for its AI prowess and has multiple products therein. However, I’d also like to note that another reason investors like Palantir is that it is proving its commercial viability. It  has long been associated with the defense sector and government spending. However, commercial revenue growth was much stronger than its government counterpart during the most recent quarter. The company is proven that it is more than just another government attache and that should allow it to continue to grow through 2025.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly one of the hottest stocks today. The company is the primary competitor to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI chip war.\n\nThe question really boils down to one essential factor. Can AMD’s M1300 chips attract a strong following that meaningfully pulls sales away from Nvidia’s h100 chips? More time will be needed for the answer to emerge. What we know now is that the two chips are comparable based on specifications with AMD’s chips outperforming in some applications. However, Nvidia’s chips cost 3 to 6 times as much.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has been able to maintain those prices and a dominant position overall. I’m not the most technically adept and I’m not a consumer being forced to make a choice between the two. That said, it seems that much of Nvidia’s advantage can be attributed to clever marketing. That suggests that firms could have a shift in perception that would benefit AMD greatly. Thus, I see AMD either surging forward if perceptions change or continuing to play a pursuer role through 2025. Either scenario should benefit share prices.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an American firm that produces carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks. The company continues to grow at a rapid pace while also making shrewd moves that should ensure its continued growth.\n\nChief among those moves is a deal for sales and distribution In Great Britain and Ireland. Results from that deal should be visible in second quarter earnings. During Q4 revenues increased by 95%, reaching $$347.4 million. The company also announced further expansion into New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIt’s clear that Celsius is intent on much bigger things in the future. The company will continue its global expansion which should further cement its lead in the market. One of the major questions is whether Celsius can continue to grow at such a rapid rate. Sales increase by 102% in 2023. That’s a tough act to follow for any company. However, CEO John Fieldly sees the same health trends that allowed the company to grow in America existing globally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Not in a Bubble: You Should Be Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist Before It Soars",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stunning artificial intelligence (AI) surge has left investors and analysts in awe. Shares of the chipmaker, which originally made its name as a manufacturer of graphics cards for personal computers (PCs), have jumped nearly sixfold since the beginning of 2023.\n\nHowever, this big jump has created doubts in certain corners of Wall Street that Nvidia stock may be in a bubble. From comparisons with the dot-com bubble of 1999 to a potential decline in AI-related demand for its chips, to its expensive valuation, there are multiple reasons why some believe that Nvidia is a bubble waiting to burst.\n\nBut a closer look at the AI market in general and Nvidia in particular will illustrate why the company is far from being in a bubble.\n\nWhy it isn't right to call Nvidia, and AI, a bubble\n\nA stock market bubble is a \"significant run-up in stock prices without a corresponding increase in the value of the businesses they represent.\" In a bubble, the valuation of a company is based on speculation instead of the actual fundamentals.\n\nHowever, if you take a closer look at how AI is driving productivity gains across multiple industries, it will become easier to understand that the adoption of this technology should ideally continue gaining momentum. For instance, Meta Platforms says that the integration of AI tools has led to an impressive jump of 32% in returns delivered by ad campaigns. Meanwhile, customer service associates are reportedly witnessing a 14% increase in productivity thanks to AI.\n\nFactories, on the other hand, are expected to witness a 30% to 50% jump in productivity in the future by integrating AI, according to Bain & Company. Investment bank UBS believes that AI could drive productivity growth of 2.5% this year, ahead of the Federal Reserve's estimate of 1.5%. Over the next three years, UBS is expecting AI to deliver 17% of productivity gains.\n\nNvidia's chips are going to play a central role in driving these productivity gains across different industries. That's because AI models need to be trained using millions and billions of parameters before they can be deployed in the real world. These models are known as large language models (LLMs), and they are being deployed across multiple verticals from manufacturing to automotive to cloud computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraining these LLMs requires massive computing power, which Nvidia's GPUs provide. This explains why companies have been queuing up to get their hands on Nvidia's flagship H100 processor, giving the chipmaker a monopoly-like position in the AI chip market with an estimated share of over 90%. The H100 sells for $25,000 to $30,000, and Nvidia reportedly makes a 1,000% profit on these cards as per Raymond James. This explains the outstanding growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSo, the sharp jump in Nvidia's stock price is not based on speculation or euphoria, but it is backed by the eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings. The good part is that Nvidia seems capable of sustaining its outstanding growth over the long run, and the U.S. government is likely to play a key role in helping it remain the dominant force in the AI chip market.\n\nA new grant by the U.S. government could help Nvidia maintain its AI supremacy\n\nNvidia's H100 processor, based on the Hopper architecture, commands solid pricing power, and that's not surprising given that it has been the go-to chip for customers looking to train AI models. As it turns out, the demand for this chip was so strong at one point that customers had to wait for as long as a year to get their hands on it.\n\nNvidia is now set to bring a new chip architecture to the market, known as Blackwell. The B200 Blackwell graphics card, which will be the successor to the H100 once it is launched later this year, is reportedly going to deliver performance gains of 7x to 30x over the H100. Nvidia also claims that it will reduce energy consumption by up to 25x.\n\nThis performance gain isn't surprising as Blackwell is reportedly going to be manufactured using a custom 4-nanometer (nm) node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. For comparison, the Hopper-based H100 was manufactured using a custom 5nm process from TSMC. By shrinking the size of the process node, TSMC has allowed Nvidia to pack 208 billion transistors as compared to 80 billion transistors in the H100.\n\nThese transistors are now packed more closely together on the chip, and as a result they deliver more computing power and generate less heat, thereby reducing electricity consumption. And now, TSMC has received a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. government, along with a $5 billion low-cost loan facility, to build a third chip plant in Arizona.\n\nTSMC is expected to use these funds to build a 2nm chip plant. Given that Nvidia is expected to be one of the customers for TSMC's 2nm chips, which are expected to go into mass production in 2025, it won't be surprising to see the graphics specialist coming out with even more powerful AI graphics cards. This explains why analysts are expecting Nvidia's data center revenue to multiply nicely in the coming years.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's earnings are expected to increase at an annual rate of 35% for the next five years, as per consensus estimates. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years.\n\nNvidia has a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39, which is slightly higher than its forward earnings multiple of 36. But even if Nvidia trades at a discounted 27 times forward earnings after five years (in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple, as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $1,569. That would be an 85% increase from current levels.\n\nHowever, don't be surprised to see this AI stock delivering stronger gains. Nvidia can outpace Wall Street's earnings growth expectations and the market could continue rewarding it with a premium valuation as its product development moves should ideally help it remain the top player in the lucrative AI chip market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "content": "A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) shook up the tech world last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI had come. As a result, countless companies have pivoted their businesses to the budding sector in an effort to take their slice of a $200 billion pie.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nConsequently, it's not too late to invest in AI, and chip stocks are some of the most attractive options. These companies are developing the hardware necessary to train and run AI models, suggesting they'll be well positioned to profit from the AI market's tailwinds for years.\n\nAs leading chipmakers, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) have significant potential in AI. However, these companies are at drastically different stages in their AI journeys, which could mean one has more room to run over the long term.\n\nSo, let's examine these chipmakers more closely and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock right now.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's business has exploded over the last year. Its stock is up 230% since last April. Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue and operating income have spiked 207% and 536%, respectively, thanks to soaring chip sales.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia cornered the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while many of its competitors scrambled to catch up. Nvidia's head start allowed it to take full advantage of the increased demand for AI GPUs, capturing an estimated 90% market share.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 60% in the last three months. Meanwhile, Nvidia's free cash flow has increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\n\nIntel\n\nNvidia's established role in AI has made it one of the more reliable options. However, it could be worth looking at a company like Intel, which isn't as settled in the industry but could have more growth potential.\n\nIntel has hit more than a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple.\n\nHowever, Intel is making major changes to its business, which could see it come back strong in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.\n\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\n\nIntel is on the road to recovery, but it will take time for its financials to reflect recent changes. As a result, an investment in Intel is recommended for more patient investors who are willing to hold for at least a decade.\n\nIs Nvidia or Intel the better AI stock? NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart indicates Intel's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\n\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics since they consider a company's financial health. And for both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAs a result, Intel's lower forward P/E and P/S suggest its stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's. However, the question is which is the better AI stock, not which is the better value.\n\nConsequently, the answer lies in the investor. If you're looking to invest in an established AI company that will likely deliver consistent but potentially small gains over many years, Nvidia is the answer. However, if you're willing to take a chance on Intel's ability to turn things around and potentially reap major rewards for its efforts, it's the AI stock to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech will outperform in a high interest rate environment: Wall Street pros",
        "content": "No rate cuts, no problem.\n\nInvestors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday’s trading action, despite another hot inflation report that puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt.\n\nThat was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles.\n\n“Many of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,” Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree cash flow from Magnificent 7 members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — jumped more than $100 billion in 2023.\n\nLast week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet’s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year.\n\nAnd Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis.\n\nNewEdge Wealth’s Cameron Dawson said big tech’s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a “defensive” and “safety” play, adding that pullbacks are “likely buyable in the short-term.”\n\n“Tech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,” said Lerner.\n\nIn addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetrick expects continued economic growth to “offer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.”\n\nA more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term.

        "content": "There's an old saying that success breeds success. When it comes to investing, many folks take that saying to mean that it might make sense to pay attention to what other successful investors are buying, and then follow their leads into the same investments. After all, even if you don't get entirely the same return as those other folks do, you might be able to ride their coattails to get some decent gains.\n\nFortunately for folks looking to follow in the investing footsteps of billionaires, many of the world's biggest investors need to disclose what they buy and sell, every quarter. To see what those potentially market-moving money managers are buying, three Motley Fool contributors went looking for signs of what transactions those major investors have been reporting. They uncovered that billionaire investors have been buying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Read on to find out why, and decide for yourself whether following those investors' leads might help you build your own wealth. Image source: Getty Images\n\nThis Magnificent Seven stock is hot, hot, hot these days\n\nEric Volkman (Nvidia): Billionaire Ray Dalio's monster hedge fund Bridgewater Associates is clearly all in on the future of artificial intelligence (AI). That's the strong signal being sent by Bridgewater's more than quintupling of its position recently in one of the Magnificent Seven stocks more readily associated with AI, Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's stock in trade is graphics processing units (GPUs), many of which are used to power AI functionalities in data centers. The rush to develop these functionalities has sharply increased demand for all sorts of hardware needed to support them, and Nvidia GPUs are front and center in this drive.\n\nIt's no wonder that the company's latest set of quarterly figures was so impressive. Do you think a year-over-year doubling of revenue is a feat? Well, that's nothing compared with Nvidia's 265% top line improvement in its fourth quarter, not to mention the nearly 500% surge in non-GAAP (adjusted) net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI is a technology with a very long runway, and since it can be applied to a great many processes and systems, it has the potential to produce many revenue streams. If Nvidia's products remain central to this -- a likely scenario -- we can expect the company to have more blowout quarters in the future.\n\nThe one serious caveat with Nvidia is that it's on a lot of investor radar screens these days; it seems almost every individual and institution on the market wants the stock in their portfolio. Even with those out-of-this-world recent fundamentals, the company is very pricey on its valuations, so its explosive share price growth might be a thing of the past.\n\nMore than a quick jolt\n\nJason Hall(Starbucks): While perusing SEC form 13-F filings recently, I noticed something interesting for Starbucks: Two of the largest and most successful quantitative trading firms, D.E. Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies, both bought shares in their most-recently reported quarter. For those who don't know, David Shaw and Jim Simons, the two founders of the former and latter, are worth nearly $40 billion combined, with their two firms easily the two most successful quantitative trading funds operating.\n\nBoth Shaw and Renaissance make most of their money relatively quickly. Their business is at least partly high-speed trading and leveraging data to make lots of bets on lots of stocks. For example, D.E. Shaw opened almost 594 new stock positions last quarter, added to another 1,607, and completely sold out of another 535 stocks. That's more than 2,700 stocks in a single quarter.\n\nWe don't know exactly when Shaw or Renaissance bought, held, or sold some of its Starbucks shares. But we do know that at the end of the quarter, they both still owned some. And with shares of the global coffee giant down over 6% since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023, and 20% off the high, there's likely some short-term opportunity for a profit for these firms.\n\nBut that's their game. For individual investors, we can't win there.\n\nHowever, Starbucks looks very appealing for the long term. Its business in China has recovered, with comps up 10%, and strong 5% same-store growth in the U.S., too. Management is looking for 15%-20% earnings-per-share growth this year as well. Combine that growth with a reasonable price below 23 times earnings and a dividend yield above 2.5%, and long-term investors can profit by owning Starbucks, too.\n\nBuffett Thinks There's Still a Future In Oil\n\nChuck Saletta (Chevron): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently elected to buy nearly 16 million shares of oil company Chevron, according to its most recently published filings of its quarterly holdings. This is yet another clear signal -- on top of Berkshire Hathaway's massive investments in energy pipelines -- that Buffett and his crew believe there's still a future in hydrocarbon-based fuels.\n\nThey're not exactly alone on that front. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's most recent Annual Energy Outlook, net demand for oil and natural gas is expected to hold relatively consistent at least through 2050. And of course, in a world where that demand is consistent over the next couple of decades, it's unlikely that people will simply stop using those fuels entirely as soon as 2051 rolls around.\n\nThe reality is that even if you assume a limited future for carbon-based fuels, at the right price, an investor can make a decent return by owning shares of companies involved in them. It's a value investing strategy based on good-old-fashioned practice of looking at what the company's cash flows will look like over time.\n\nTrading at around 14 times its earnings, an investor doesn't have to project massive growth to have a chance at decent returns from Chevron. That's particularly true when you recognize that Chevron pays its investors a decent dividend yield of around 4%.\n\nEven looking simplistically, with a 4% yield that holds steady, an investor would get his or her money paid back over the course of 25 years. That provides a potential path to a complete return of invested capital over that time, while the investor would still own the shares that generate those dividends. And of course, since demand is likely to continue beyond that point, there's a chance to earn even more.\n\nNet -- even in the absence of a massive growth story, there's good reason to believe there's still value to be extracted from the oil patch. And if that's good enough for Buffett, it just might be good enough for us mere mortals.\n\nAre you ready to follow these leading investors?\n\nRay Dalio's purchase on Nvidia, D.E. Shaw's and Renaissance's ownership of Starbucks, and Buffett's Berskhire Hathaway's buy of Chevron showcase that there are many ways to look to profit from the market. These leading investors appeared to follow three very different approaches to determine which stocks looked worthy of their money.\n\nThat should give you good reason to believe that you, too, should be able to find a path to decent returns from investing. Nobody -- not even successful billionaires -- can guarantee what you'll earn in the stock market, but as their successes over time has shown, a big part of making money in the market comes from simply showing up and following a reasonable strategy over time.\n\nSo get started now, and make today the day you decide to follow these great investors into the market, whether or not you actually buy the exact same investments that they do.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $540,321!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSomething weird happened in the stock market this week — besides the thumping from a surprise Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nMarket darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock fell into correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from a recent high.\n\nAt its low of around $830 midway through Tuesday's session, the stock was down 12.6% from its March 25 high. It has since recovered a bit to $900 but is still off by 5% from the highs.\n\n\"This is a breather for Nvidia, as more investors are playing the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of AI across the semi and software ecosystem,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. \"We view this as a digestion period for the Street for Nvidia and nothing more.\"\n\nMaybe that will prove correct. Who knows?\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes volatility in Nvidia is nothing new — the current sell-off marks the ninth time the stock has declined 10% or more since ChatGPT was launched back in late 2022.\n\n\"There are some market factors such as the recent rise in inflation, volatility (VIX), AI stock fatigue, rotation towards more cyclical sectors and possibly some pruning ahead of upcoming earnings season,\" Arya said. \"On a fundamental basis we have also heard of investor concern around rising competition and reducing lead-times (suggesting decelerating demand) for Nvidia GPU accelerators (though expected as new Blackwell demand grows).\" CEO Jensen Huang during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nI happen to think Nvidia's stock sell-off is a near-term headwind to the broader markets that should be respected way more than it is. Arya gets at it a bit in his note, but it warrants further amplification.\n\nHere is a stock truly beloved by Wall Street and Main Street — for real, fundamental reasons such as the AI explosion powering demand for super chips — losing ground. It's one of the clearest signs yet that investors think stocks have come on too hard and too fast this year against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the price action suggests investors who are actively seeking new reasons to buy stocks at peak valuations are coming up empty. Now, they may simply be waiting to buy top names like Nvidia at cheaper prices.\n\nThat wait-and-see mindset is what the pros are doing with Nvidia's stock and other stocks with a high valuation but well-understood investment thesis.\n\nAnd it's not like we haven't seen Nvidia leading the broader market lower before — it happened last summer!\n\nEvercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel correctly pointed out that Nvidia's stock did next to nothing from July 2023 to October 2023 (chart below). It ended up being the catalyst that brought the S&P 500 lower.\n\nBottom line: For the broader market to get its mojo back, its favorite stock has to get its mojo back.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Arm Holdings",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) have been in fine form on the stock market in 2024 with impressive gains of 75% and 66%, respectively, so far, and artificial intelligence (AI) has played a key role in this solid surge.\n\nWhile Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results, which were released in February, established the company's dominance in the fast-growing market for AI chips, Arm also joined the AI bandwagon following its latest quarterly results. However, if you are looking to buy an AI stock right now and need to choose between Nvidia and Arm Holdings, which one should you buy?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's eye-popping stock market surge can be justified by the company's terrific share of the AI chip market, which has led to a sharp acceleration in the company's revenue and earnings growth in recent quarters. The graphics specialist ended fiscal 2024 with $60.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 126% over the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up 288% in fiscal 2024 to $12.96 per share, driven by a jump of 14.6 percentage points in the company's gross margin. That's not surprising as the chipmaker has been enjoying immense pricing power in the AI chip market. Its flagship H100 AI processor reportedly carries a hefty margin of 1,000%, according to financial services and investment banking provider Raymond James.\n\nWhat's more, customers have been willing to pay the high prices of Nvidia's AI processors as they don't want to be left behind in the race to develop AI applications. Meta Platforms, for instance, is going to spend more money on procuring Nvidia's H100 processor in 2024. It is also worth noting that major cloud computing providers have already set their sights on deploying Nvidia's next-generation AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture.\n\nAll this indicates why Nvidia is anticipating that the demand for its upcoming AI processors will continue to be higher than supply, even though the company has been taking steps to boost its production capacity. The healthy demand for Nvidia's AI chips explains why analysts have significantly upgraded their revenue growth expectations from the company for the current fiscal year and beyond.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nEven better, analysts estimate that Nvidia's robust share of the AI chip market is likely to translate into healthy long-term growth, with its data center revenue alone jumping to $280 billion by 2027. As such, Nvidia could continue to be a top growth stock thanks to the fact that it currently controls more than 90% of the lucrative AI chip market, which is expected to generate more than $300 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade.\n\nThe case for Arm Holdings\n\nLike Nvidia, Arm Holdings is also a play on the AI chip market. However, unlike Nvidia, the company isn't involved in manufacturing chips. Instead, Arm licenses its intellectual property (IP), software tools, and architecture to chipmakers so that they can develop and manufacture different types of processors such as central processing units (CPUs), neural processing units (NPUs), and graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe demand for all these types of chips is increasing thanks to the growing adoption of AI servers, personal computers (PCs), and smartphones. Not surprisingly, the number of companies looking to develop AI chips with the help of Arm's IP has also increased. Arm reported that 27 companies are using its total access license at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 18 at the end of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company credits the new licensing agreements to the growing demand for \"high-performance CPUs etc. to embedded AI into every end device.\" The new licenses explain why Arm's revenue pipeline saw a significant improvement. Its remaining performance obligations (RPO), which refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts, shot up to $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3, up 38% from the year-ago period.\n\nThere is a solid chance that Arm will be able to sustain this newly found momentum in the long run as well. That's because the company's architecture powers more than 50% of the chips that have a processor inside them. Also, the adoption of the company's AI-specific Armv9 architecture, which commands double the royalty compared to the previous generation's architecture, is increasing at a nice pace.\n\nIn all, it is easy to see why analysts raised their revenue growth projections from Arm as well. ARM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAlso, analysts forecast the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of just over 44% over the next five years, which is higher than the 38% annual earnings growth expected from Nvidia.\n\nThe verdict\n\nBoth Arm Holdings and Nvidia benefit from the proliferation of AI chips. However, investors looking to choose one of these two AI stocks now would be better off investing in Nvidia.\n\nThat's because Nvidia stock is significantly cheaper than Arm Holdings right now from a valuation perspective. Nvidia's sales multiple of 36 is lower than Arm's reading of 44. A similar story unfolds if we look at their trailing and forward earnings multiples. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Arm, as the latter's revenue is expected to increase 19% this year. Arm, therefore, is expensive if you consider the potential growth that it is expected to deliver, making Nvidia the better AI stock to buy right now as it is not only delivering stronger growth but also has a much cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 unstoppable stocks that will make you richer. To skip the detailed analysis of the economy and market, go directly to the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nOn April 12, the week closed out with stocks tumbling as the  S&P 500 recorded its worst day since January 31, declining 1.46% on the day. On top of that, oil prices are rising significantly as tensions in the Middle East grow. The WTI Crude has risen around $10 since January and is at $85.5 per barrel. The stubbornness of inflation has kept investors and other experts wondering what would happen next.\n\nInterest Rates Amid Current Inflationary Environment\n\nThe latest inflation report showed a higher-than-expected increase of 3.5% which has shaken markets and raised concerns about the possibility of a recession. In an interview with Bloomberg, on April 11, BMO Capital’s strategist, Ian Lyngen, suggests that if inflation continues at these levels, the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to induce a recession in order to meet its 2% inflation target. Manulife Investment Management’s chief economist, Frances Donald also agrees with Ian Lyngen and thinks that inflation is going to “surprise upside” in the near term, causing the Fed to lose the data support to cut interest rates. She said:\n\n“That increases the probability of a recession and I remember members of my team, back in December said, the Fed is pivoted early, this is gonna provide indirect easing, we should lower our probability of recession calls for 2024. But now that we're back to an environment where we're losing those embedded rate cuts, we actually have to increase the chance of something bad happening here.\"\n\nBlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) CEO, Larry Fink told CNBC on April 12, that he still expects two rate cuts this year but the Fed isn’t likely to meet the 2% inflation target. We previously mentioned the comments from BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, that he keeps a bullish view of the current year and the years ahead. For more information on that, go to 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks that Made People Rich in 2023\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the forerunner among the stocks that have made investors rich in 2023, as the company surged nearly 240% last year and is continuing its upward run with year-to-date gains of over 83% on April 12. The stock isn’t on our current list as analyst price targets do not show enough upside for the stock. However, the company still has massive future growth potential despite new competitors rising to take away a bit of AI accelerator market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nNevertheless, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya still believes in the stock’s upside potential and says that the company’s commanding presence in business sales not only shields its market share but also positions it strategically to potentially increase its market share. On April 10, the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a $1,100 price target, up from $925.\n\nDuring the tech industry surge of 2023, there were a few multi-baggers that remained in the dark with all the news surrounding the AI revolution. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) was one such company that returned massively when everyone was busy looking at the Magnificent 7. It is a Connecticut-based company that handles less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping across North America. While the broader industrial sector significantly underperformed the market in 2023, XPO, Inc.’s (NYSE:XPO) share price gained over 163%. Additionally, the company's stock is up 48.2% year-to-date on April 12 compared to the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 23% gain over the same period. On top of that, the company isn’t looking to slow down in the next few years. Its CEO, Mario Harik made the following comments at the company’s latest earnings call:\n\n“For 2024, we expect our LTL capex level to be in the low-teens as a percent of revenue, and again, primarily allocated to our fleet. In terms of the 28 service centers, we acquired from Yellow, the largest impact on our capital strategy is timing. We've put forward dozens of real estate investments that we plan to make over the next several years. I'll add some strategic color to my earlier comments on the acquisition.\n\nThese service centers will deliver important benefits to the business for years to come. First, they'll get us closer to customers, and give us larger facilities in major metro areas. This should drive substantial cost efficiencies across our line haul, pickup-and-delivery and dock operations. Second, they'll enhance our yield growth by further improving, our service with fewer freight three handles, reduce damages, and better on-time performance.\n\nAnd third, that'll give us more capacity in key metros like Indianapolis, Columbus and Las Vegas. These are markets where we are currently turning away profitable customers, because we don't have enough door capacity. We plan to start bringing these locations online in April and have all of them operational within the next 12 months to 18 months. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS and our LTL operating ratio in 2025.”\n\nNow let us move on to unstoppable stocks of the current year that can potentially make you richer. The list includes Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH). 10 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 20 large to mega-cap stocks that have experienced a share price gain of at least 20% year-to-date as of April 11, and have an average analyst price target upside of at least 10%. We narrowed down our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upsides and listed them in ascending order of upside potential, primarily, and year-to-date gains, secondarily. Analyst ratings and price targets were taken from TipRanks.\n\nWe also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.48%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 30.49%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 129\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers ride-hailing services and operates through three segments, Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. For the quarter ended on December 31, 2023, the company recorded 28 million trips per day and 150 million monthly active platform consumers.

D E Shaw has increased its stake in the company by 30% to 14.39 million shares worth $886.123 million and is the most significant shareholder, as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nRiverPark Advisors stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n8. Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.78%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 23.82%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc.

(NYSE:CRBG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG), a provider of life insurance and retirement solutions, was a standout in the financials sector. Corebridge was previously a unit of AIG and a September 2022 IPO. Earnings and cash flow have been solid, aided by increased spread income in the general account due to higher reinvestment rates. We added Corebridge to the portfolio in Q1 2023. Our thesis is now that Corebridge is not a part of a large inefficient and capital-constrained parent, the company should have plenty of room to improve its competitive position. Establishing new processes that both improve capabilities and wring out efficiencies as a standalone entity should help improve ROE in coming years. It has a 4%+ dividend yield and a double-digit free cash flow yield, even in 2022 when negative fixed income and equity markets reduced fee revenue. In addition to the dividend, free cash flow will be used to ensure holding company liquidity, repurchase stock and support modest growth expectations.”\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.12%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 37%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.

The average price target of $93.10 implies an upside of 15.123% from the last price of $80.87, as of April 11.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius’ product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.”\n\n6. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.34%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 44.84%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 51\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses, through Garena, Shopee, and SeaMoney, respectively.

(NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH).\n\nLakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Meanwhile, the largest detractor was Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) (-17.1%), which sold off following the release of its quarterly results where earnings came in below expectations. For our part, while a headline drop in profitability can appear worrying, we aren’t overly concerned as it was merely a function of management’s intentional decision to increase investment towards e-commerce to drive growth. As the broader Southeast Asian e-commerce market recovers from some post pandemic headwinds and their primary competitor TikTok is entangled in a regulatory setback in Indonesia, we agree with management that now is the time to be aggressive and pivot back to growth mode and consolidate market share.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now 11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In 20 Biggest Iron Ore Mining Companies in Australia, 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Best Value Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Value Penny Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nWhen 2024 started many analysts were ringing warning bells regarding valuations of mega-cap technology stocks that touched their new highs in the last quarter of 2023 amid the AI boom. These analysts were right about some names (Apple, Tesla, among others) that failed to sustain their bull run, but proved wrong about the leaders in the AI domain (Nvidia, for example). During all this, many experts are also talking about a possible return of value stocks.\n\nThe Return of Value in 2024?\n\nIn March, a Bloomberg report talked in detail about how many investment firms were pouring money into value stocks from sectors like financials, energy, materials and utilities. Among the investors preferring these sectors included Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist of Hartford Funds, who liked stocks from these “unloved sectors.” The Bloomberg report also mentioned Presilium Private Wealth, which said it found value investing attractive in the current environment.\n\nBlackRock's Pivot Towards Value\n\nAnother pivot towards value investing came in January 2024 when BlackRock initiated a massive reshuffle to its model portfolios to reflect its preference for value versus growth. According to a Bloomberg report, Michael Gates, who leads Model Portfolio Solutions in the Americas within BlackRock's Multi-Asset Strategies & Solutions group, said that the company was switching to value from growth style to reflect a “bullish view on the economy and a soft landing.”\n\nIndicating confidence in value investing, Franklin Templeton said in a December 2023 report that value stocks were looking more “promising” for 2024 and beyond amid volatility in the financial markets. The report said comparing trailing P/E multiples for global growth and value stocks with their return over the next 10 years shows that “lower P/E stocks achieved higher future returns over the next decade, based on data from FactSet and MSCI. As such, with growth stocks’ stretched valuations, we see many opportunities to find compelling value opportunities with significant future return potential.”\n\nStory continues\n\nDavid Einhorn's Comments About Value Investing During The 2024 Sohn Conference\n\nBillionaire David Einhorn said during The 2024 Sohn Investment Conference that it’s a great time to be a value investor. But at the same time he’s been saying that value investing as an industry is dead (we covered Einhorn’s thoughts on the demise of value investing industry here). When asked about these apparently contradictory opinions during a program on CNBC, Einhorn said that value investing industry and value investing as an investing strategy are two different things. He said many fund managers who were paid heavily by people to research undervalued stocks for them have lost their jobs and assets under management amid a shift to index funds where “millions of dollars were redeemed” out of those conventional strategies. But Einhorn said that this development has decreased the competition in the industry and people like him are now in a unique position to find undervalued stocks. Best Value Penny Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nPerformance of Value Stocks\n\nVanguard Value Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTV) is up by 3.9% year to date through April 14, while Schwab US Large-Cap Value ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHV) is up 3.3% in the same period, compared to the S&P 500’s gain of 8%. Russell 1000 Index (INDEXRUSSELL:RUI) is up 7.7% in 2024 through April 13 while the index has gained about 23% over the past one year. RUI tracks mid-cap and large-cap US companies that have value characteristics.\n\nValue Investor Seth Klarman's Prediction from 2000\n\nLegendary value investor Seth Klarman in his 2000 letter to investors bemoaned the market's irrational behavior and said that sooner or later investors would come back to the traditional ways of valuing companies:\n\n\"I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value. Over time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.\"\n\nMethodology For this article we first used a stock screener to identify penny stocks with PE ratios under 15. From these stocks we picked 11 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We gave preference to stocks that come from sectors like consumer, healthcare, energy, materials and utilities.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence Stocks",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology. Companies across tech pivoted their businesses to the budding sector in an effort to take their slice of a $200 billion pie.\n\nThe AI market is developing rapidly. Data from Grand View Research projects it to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030 and hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion. As a result, it's not surprising that investors have flocked to the industry. Excitement over AI saw the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rise 67% in 2023, creating more than a few millionaires along the way.\n\nThe market has shown no signs of slowing. AI can potentially boost many areas, from cloud computing to e-commerce, consumer products, autonomous vehicles, video games, and more. As a result, it's not too late to invest in AI and enjoy significant gains from its development over the long term.\n\nHere are three millionaire-maker AI stocks to buy this April.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt shouldn't be too surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) on this list after the company cornered the market on AI chips last year. In 2023, Nvidia snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models.\n\nNvidia's years of dominance in GPUs allowed it to get a headstart in AI over many of its competitors, leading its stock to rise 214% over the last year alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily due to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nThe vast potential of AI suggests chip demand will continue rising, and Nvidia will likely continue seeing major gains from the industry.\n\nStory continues NVDA Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the chart above shows Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months. Consequently, now is an excellent time to consider investing in this millionaire-maker AI stock before it's too late.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has grown into a tech behemoth, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company by market cap earlier this year. The tech giant is home to some of the most widely recognizable brands, including Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on Microsoft's expanding position in AI this year. The company was an early investor in AI, sinking billions into a private company, OpenAI, in 2019. The lucrative partnership granted Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry and helped its stock rise more than 45% year over year.\n\nMicrosoft has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup and get ahead of its rivals. In 2023, the company added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features. OpenAI's models and Microsoft's massive user base could make the company unstoppable in AI.\n\nMicrosoft's P/E of 37 means its stock isn't exactly trading at a bargain. However, its prominent role in AI and $67 billion in free cash flow make its stock worth the high price point, as it has the funds to continue investing in its business and retain its lead. I wouldn't bet against Microsoft's ability to create even more millionaires from investors willing to hold for the long term.\n\n3. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nChip stocks have taken center stage amid soaring interest in AI, and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is another attractive investment option. The company was slightly late to the AI party as Nvidia beat it to the market. However, AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in AI over the long term.\n\nLast December, the company unveiled its MI300X AI GPU. This new chip is designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nAdditionally, AMD wants to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.  AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts.\n\nThis chart shows AMD's stock has significant potential in the coming years. The company's earnings could hit just over $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by AMD's forward P/E of 47 yields a stock price of $329.\n\nConsidering AMD's current position, these projections would see its stock price rise 93% by fiscal 2026. Alongside growing prospects in AI, AMD is a stock that could make you a millionaire.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Buying and holding great companies for a very long time is a proven strategy for making money in the stock market. This allows investors to not only make the most of secular growth trends but also helps compound their investments over time.\n\nFor instance, an investment worth $10,000 in shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) a decade ago is now worth $1.9 million. That translates into a whopping annual return of almost 70% over the past 10 years. During this time, Nvidia investors have benefited from the growing adoption of the company's graphics cards in the gaming, automotive, and data center markets, illustrating just why holding a solid company for a long time could be a rewarding thing to do -- even helping you become a millionaire.\n\nHowever, a stock jumping 100x and turning $10,000 into nearly $2 million dollars is a rare occurrence. But at the same time, if you have that much cash available after paying off your bills, saving for tough times, and clearing high-interest debt, it may be a wise thing to put that money into an undervalued stock with terrific long-term potential.\n\nDoing so will not only help you benefit from the power of compounding and secular growth opportunities but also allow you to construct a diversified portfolio.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why buying Nvidia right now as a part of a diversified portfolio could help investors become millionaires in the long run.\n\nHere's why Nvidia stock is undervalued\n\nYou may be wondering why I'm calling Nvidia an undervalued stock following stunning gains of more than 500% since the beginning of 2023. After all, the shares are trading at 36 times sales and 74 times trailing earnings. Both figures are significantly higher than the company's five-year average sales multiple of 18 and trailing earnings multiple of 65.\n\nHowever, Nvidia stock is undervalued based on the potential growth it is forecast to deliver. This is evident from the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36, which is lower than the five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39. Meanwhile, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) is another clear indication of the stock's undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe PEG ratio is determined by dividing a stock's P/E ratio by the projected annual earnings growth it is expected to deliver. In simpler words, the PEG ratio helps investors understand how expensive a stock is with respect to the growth it could deliver. A PEG ratio of less than 1 means that the stock is undervalued. As the following chart tells us, Nvidia is significantly undervalued based on the PEG ratio is concerned. NVDA PEG Ratio Chart\n\nBuying Nvidia at this multiple looks like the smart thing to do considering that it is sitting on lucrative secular growth opportunities in multiple markets. Let's take a look at them.\n\nThese solid opportunities can help Nvidia maintain its eye-popping growth\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the reason why Nvidia stock has surged so impressively in the past year or so. The good part is that the company's share-price surge is backed by solid growth in its revenue and earnings.\n\nAfter finishing fiscal 2024 with a 126% increase in revenue to $60.9 billion and a 288% jump in adjusted earnings to $12.96 per share, analysts are expecting Nvidia to sustain its outstanding growth over the next three fiscal years. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMore importantly, Wall Street is bullish about Nvidia's long-term prospects. For instance, analyst Vijay Rakesh of Japanese investment bank Mizuho is expecting Nvidia's data center revenue to increase to $89 billion in fiscal 2025 from last year's $47.5 billion. By fiscal 2028, Rakesh is estimating that Nvidia could generate $280 billion from its data center business alone thanks to the terrific growth opportunity in the market for AI chips.\n\nThat won't be surprising for a couple of reasons. First, the global AI chip market is predicted to generate $400 billion in revenue in 2027, according to Advanced Micro Devices. Second, Nvidia is leading the AI chip market by a huge margin, with an estimated market share of over 95%. The good part is that Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the top player in this space.\n\nFrom launching new AI graphics cards that are way more powerful than the existing ones at aggressive prices to making a reported move into the market for custom AI chips, there is a good chance that the company will continue to dominate this market in the long run. Meanwhile, Nvidia is also set to capitalize on new niches such as digital twins and AI personal computers (PCs).\n\nThese are multibillion-dollar opportunities for the company. For example, Nvidia management is forecasting a $150 billion addressable market for its Omniverse enterprise software, and it has started making headway. Similarly, the potential revenue opportunity for Nvidia in the AI PC market suggests that its annual gaming sales could jump by 5 times over the next four years.\n\nAll this shows that Nvidia could indeed remain a top growth stock in the long run because the market is likely to reward its healthy growth with more gains. That's why investors looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio can consider buying it while it remains undervalued.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Taking the Fight to Nvidia",
        "content": "If there is one stock that exemplifies the potential to profit from artificial intelligence (AI), it would have to be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that rendered lifelike images in video games. What makes these chips so effective is parallel processing, which takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Nvidia was able to adapt this technology to handle the rigors of AI, making it arguably the most successful company in the AI chip space.\n\nHowever, as demand for AI has accelerated, numerous technology stalwarts have been working furiously behind the scenes to come up with viable alternatives to Nvidia's industry-leading processors. This week saw a number of announcements as rivals unveiled the fruit of these efforts.\n\nLet's take a look at three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Intel\n\nEarlier this week, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its latest AI chip, dubbed Gaudi 3, in a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU dominance. The company claims that Gaudi can train AI models nearly twice as fast as Nvidia's H100 flagship data center processor and 50% faster for inference -- running AI models that have already been trained. The company also said Gaudi delivered all that performance with 40% better power efficiency than the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost,\" according to Intel.\n\nIt's important to note that Nvidia recently unveiled the successor to its H100, its Blackwell B200 AI GPU, which will begin shipping later this year. While Gaudi wasn't compared to the B200, the company said, \"We do expect it to be highly competitive\" against Nvidia's latest processor, calling Gaudi \"a strong offering.\"\n\nIntel is likely not looking to outperform Nvidia's most recent AI chips but rather offer enterprises a cheaper alternative. It's also worth noting that there's been an ongoing shortage of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips, creating a bottleneck in AI adoption. Intel's latest offering could help alleviate the backlog.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nNot to be outdone, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) announced the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v2, a custom AI chip that runs in the company's data centers. Meta announced that the latest version of its MTIA \"more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth\" of its predecessor. Early results suggest the new processor performs three times better than the first version.\n\nMeta noted that it's trying to provide \"the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity\" with its latest chip. The company isn't using these chips for AI processing; at least, not yet. Meta is using the processors to improve the speed and efficiency of its ranking and recommendation systems, used to surface relevant content on its social media sites and target advertising.\n\nMeta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, so if it is successful in its AI chip efforts, the company could reduce its dependency on Nvidia's AI processors.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAt the Google Cloud Next event this week, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) announced the availability of Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5p, the latest version of its AI-centric processor. The company said its Cloud TPU can train large language models (LLMs) -- which underpin AI systems -- three times faster than version 4.\n\nAs is generally the case, Google's TPUs won't be sold but will be available on Google Cloud later this year.\n\nHowever, in a blog post, Google noted that it's expanding its Nvidia GPU capabilities with the addition of the A3 Mega Supercomputer, which is powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs. Google Cloud customers will also have access to virtual machines (VM) featuring Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Grace Blackwell GB200 GPUs.\n\nGoogle also unveiled Axion, its first data center central processing unit (CPU), designed in conjunction with Arm Holdings. Google says Axion is 30% faster than the leading CPU, with 50% better performance and 62% greater efficiency than x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nAn important takeaway for Nvidia investors\n\nWhile Intel intends to compete directly with Nvidia for a piece of the AI chip market, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are developing their own AI chips for specific purposes, either in-house or for cloud customers. Furthermore, while Intel claims its AI-centric chips can compete head-to-head with Nvidia's flagship processors, Nvidia has already moved on and will soon be shipping the next version of its state-of-the-art AI processors.\n\nThis helps highlight Nvidia's enviable position in the industry -- its rivals are always playing catch-up. They claim to best Nvidia in terms of performance, but their bragging rights don't last, as Nvidia's next-generation chips are already on the way.\n\nIt's also important to point out that the market for generative AI is growing at a rapid clip, increasing the market for these cutting-edge processors. As a result, Nvidia will likely maintain its industry-leading position, even as rivals enter the fray.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The AI wars are starting to heat up.\n\nUp until now, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has dominated the market for AI chips with an estimated 98% share of the data center GPU market. However, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is now throwing its hat into the ring -- the company launched its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Intel, the new chip is well-positioned to grab market share from Nvidia. Intel claims:\n\nThe Gaudi 3 delivers 50% better inference on average and 40% better power efficiency on average than the Nvidia H100 The Gaudi 3 sells for a fraction of the H100's cost. Intel said the new chip would be available to serve manufacturers like Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and Super Micro Computer. It also announced new Gaudi customers and partners such as Bharti Airtel, Bosch, IBM, and NielsenIQ.\n\nWall Street had a mostly tepid reaction to the news. Intel stock rose 1% on Tuesday on high volume, before sliding 3% on Wednesday on concerns related to the hotter-than-expected inflation report.\n\nThough Intel stock soared through 2023 on hopes for a cyclical recovery in the semiconductor sector and excitement around AI, the stock has fallen flat in 2024, down 26% year to date, even as the rest of the chip sector has continued to climb on the AI boom. Intel tumbled in January on disappointing guidance in its fourth quarter, and the stock fell sharply just last week as the company revealed a $7 billion loss in its foundry segment in 2023 after it restructured its business segments. The company said that loss would expand this year before it moves toward break-even in the foundry biz by 2027, and then profitability from then on.\n\nIntel has a long history of underperforming its peers, and the stock is still down from its peak during the dot-com boom. Over the last decade, Intel shares have gained 38%, compared to a 176% gain for the S&P 500. However, the Gaudi 3 gives the company a shot at redemption. Image source: Intel.\n\nWhat Gaudi 3 means for Intel\n\nTo get a sense of the opportunity in data center GPUs, you only have to take a peek at Nvidia's recent results. The leading AI chip company brought in $18.4 billion in data center revenue in its fourth quarter, up 409% from the quarter a year ago. By contrast, Intel reported a 10% decline in data center revenue to $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news for Intel is that it doesn't have to take much market share from Nvidia to move the needle in AI chips -- even $1 billion in revenue per quarter would be meaningful.\n\nThere are still significant shortages of Nvidia's AI superchips like the H100, and its components are selling at a premium, which puts Intel in a good position to take some market share. However, putting a meaningful dent in Nvidia's AI leadership won't be so easy.\n\nNvidia steps up its game\n\nIntel's press release and white paper on Gaudi 3 tout its performance against Nvidia's H100 accelerator, attributing its better throughput and inference to its large high-bandwidth memory (HBM), its more efficient architecture, and its HBM capacity.\n\nThe problem with that comparison for Intel is that Nvidia's H100 is about to be replaced by the Blackwell platform it announced at its developer conference last month. According to Nvidia, Blackwell is four times faster than the H100 and can run trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy needs than the H100.\n\nIntel's Gaudi 3 may have narrowed the gap with the H100, but Nvidia is still winning the AI race with Blackwell, which is expected to be available later this year.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's CUDA software platform, which includes developer tools and libraries to assist with building AI applications, also gives Nvidia an advantage over challengers like Intel, which is trying to match CUDA's capabilities with an open-source platform.\n\nFinally, Intel's cost advantage might also be less of a benefit than it seems. There are billions and billions of dollars sloshing through the generative AI market right now, and investors and companies are willing to shell out at this stage to gain a sustainable edge in generative AI, which could be a multi-trillion-dollar market.\n\nWhile some customers may be more price-sensitive than others, computing capabilities, speed, and capacity are the key elements that Nvidia, Intel, and others like Advanced Micro Devices are competing on here, rather than price.\n\nFor Intel, dethroning Nvidia will be difficult -- the AI chip leader has been investing in this technology for several years, has a complementary software platform in CUDA, and will fight for market share in what's now the vast majority of its revenue.\n\nIntel may pick off enough revenue to make investors happy, but it's unlikely the Gaudi 3 will lead to a wholesale shift in AI leadership from Nvidia to Intel. Nvidia investors shouldn't be worried at this stage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Has 26% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year or so has made Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) a rock star among the Wall Street set. However, after gaining 224% over the past year (as of this writing), the stock has hit a wall, leading some investors to believe the best gains are already in the rearview mirror.\n\nBut at least one Wall Street analyst believes there's still plenty of upside ahead.\n\nProfiting from the AI boom\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed his price target of $1,100 while maintaining a buy rating on the stock. That represents potential gains for investors of 26% compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst addressed Nvidia's sell-off, calling it a \"refreshing pause,\" noting it's the ninth decline of 10% or more since late 2022.\n\nThe analyst goes further, saying Nvidia's fundamentals are solid, and these periods of consolidation \"tend to set the stock up for strong moves later.\" He reiterated his opinion that Nvidia is a \"top pick.\"\n\nThe wall of worry\n\nIf they're looking, Nvidia investors can find plenty to worry about. There's the specter of growing competition, inflation, and historically high interest rates. These concerns, taken together, may be leading some fair-weather investors to take profits ahead of Nvidia's next earnings report -- but that could be a costly mistake.\n\nI would suggest investors focus on what we do know. It's still early days in the evolution of AI, and adoption is proceeding at an accelerated rate. Until someone builds a better mousetrap, Nvidia is still the industry leader, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with 95% of the market. It's also the GPU leader in data center operations, with a dominant 95% share of that market.\n\nAfter three successive quarters of triple-digit, record-setting growth, Nvidia is forecasting another. The stock is trading for 36 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium compared to the price-to-earnings ratio of 28 for the S&P 500, it's an attractive price in light of Nvidia's opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best nanotechnology stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our introduction to the nanotechnology sector and how it covers a variety of applications ranging from healthcare to consumer technology, then you can skip ahead to read 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In.\n\nJust like artificial intelligence, nanotechnology is another set of technologies that once belonged to the realm of science fiction. Nanotechnology refers to items that are smaller than 100 nanometers. These are used in a wide variety of applications, such as sunscreen and medicines since the small size of the particles allows them to behave in ways that regularly sized items cannot.\n\nOne of the most lucrative applications of nanotechnology comes in the semiconductor industry. Modern day chips, such as those that power Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone or the latest artificial intelligence graphics processing units from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), are made of transistors that are often as small as just a couple of nanometers. In fact, the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is currently mass producing semiconductors with feature sizes as small as 3 nanometers. Nothing short of magic, making transistors that are just nanometers wide or long provides chips with dozens of benefits over their predecessors, with the most evident ones being improved electrical conductivity, better power efficiency, and of course, higher computing power.\n\nAnother well known user of nanotechnology is the medical industry. It is used for a wide variety of direct and indirect medicinal purposes, such as treating cancer, imaging diseases, and even making new tissues. One such company is the Paris, France based biotechnology firm Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX). A specialized biotechnology firm, Nanobiotix uses nano particles to fight cancers of the head, pancreas, and other regions and organs of the human body. The three analysts that cover the stock have rated the shares as Strong Buy on average, and priced in a hefty upside through an average share price target of $11.98. In fact, April 2024 is turning out to be a crucial month for Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) as the firm completed the dose escalation portion of its first phase trial of a lung cancer treatment called NBTXR3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe treatment targets small cell lung cancer, and it is aimed to help specifically those patients who cannot be treated by surgery or those who have seen their cancer return after earlier bouts of radiation therapy. It uses hafnium oxide nano particles, and Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) is optimistic that while the current trial is only working with lung cancer patients, future uses of NBTXR3 could apply to other cancers as well given hafnium oxide's mechanism of action. Wall Street, it seems, is having a hard time believing the firm, as the stock is down by 15% year to date.\n\nHowever, while Nanobiotix hasn't done well this year, what about the broader nanotechnology sector? Since nanotechnology covers a wide variety of use cases, some of which we've covered above, it is difficult to ascribe to the sector defined determinants of share price performance. In other words, for example, while the broader biotechnology sector tends to underperform when interest rates are high, the same cannot be said with certainty for all nanotechnology firms.\n\nYet, we can see how stock indexes that allow investors to track the sector are doing. One such stock index is the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index. It tracks \"companies that produce nanoscale materials, as well as those that use nanotechnology in their production lines or that build machines capable of measuring information at the nanoscale,\" which provides it exposure to the broader nanotechnology sector as opposed to customized use cases such as chips and medicines. So how are these nanotechnology stocks performing? Well, the index is up by 9.48% year to date, however, its performance over the past 12 months and three years hasn't been too encouraging. Over these two time periods, the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index has been negative 7.5% and negative 25.10%. These time periods have been marked by global economic turbulence in the form of soaring inflation, rising interest rates, and wars - which appear to have made their mark on nanotechnology stocks as well.\n\nSo, if you were wondering which nanotechnology stocks to buy, we made one such list today. Some top picks are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). 11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In\n\nIrina Kozorog/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best nanotechnology stocks, we looked at our previous coverage and some other nano medicine firms and ranked the companies by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

        "title": "7 Must-Own Tech Stocks to Capitalize on the AI Frenzy",
        "content": "In the current market scenario, the one sector that promises significant returns in the coming years is the tech sector. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the tech sector has been thriving, and tech stocks have been hitting new highs over the past few months. There is immense potential in the industry, and according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), AI-related investments will reach $200 billion globally by 2025. As the adoption of AI increases and it penetrates multiple industries, we will see companies report impressive numbers, and now is the time to watch out for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe companies not adopting or investing in AI could end up losing a lot of business. The success of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is proof of the impact of AI in our world, and it is currently crowned the winner in the AI race. However, there is still a long way to go, and several companies are investing in AI to make the most of the hype. If you missed out on the chance to buy NVDA stock, here are seven AI stocks to buy if you want to make the most of the AI frenzy.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) enjoys an early-mover advantage of having invested in OpenAI and integrated AI into its products and services. It has a comprehensive approach to integrating AI in all the services, allowing for higher revenue and growth in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has already achieved success with the cloud and is aiming to monetize through Microsoft Copilot. It has a subscription model, and the company has seen a massive rise in the number of subscribers, with over 1 million in October 2023. That will give a revenue boost to the company.\n\nI am certain its quarterly results will be impressive, and if you want to own only one tech stock, it has to be Microsoft. Up 14% year-to-date (YTD), MSFT stock will steadily keep moving higher, and the results could lead to a rally. The stock also pays a dividend and has a modest yield of 0.70%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) has been making big moves lately and is on an aggressive expansion spree. It is building 100 data centers and launched the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform to offer cloud services to other companies. The company has recently signed a deal with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) to combine their AI prowess.\n\nThe deal can be game-changing and improve the growth prospects of both companies. It also signed a contract with Nvidia, where both companies will market cloud offerings, AI chips and software. These deals show Oracle’s strength to win the market. It has also reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle also saw a 29% YOY jump in the order backlog. Trading at $123 today, the stock is up 18% YTD and 31% in the year. An established industry player, Oracle has all it takes to succeed in the thriving AI space.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the hottest tech companies right now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) plays a crucial role in expanding the AI industry. It is also a very important industry player for Nvidia since TSM makes most of the chips designed by Nvidia and the chips required to run AI technologies.\n\nThe company recently won $6.6 billion in government funding for chip production. That is aimed at increasing the company’s manufacturing capacity in the U.S. The company will expand its investment in Arizona by $25 billion to $65 billion and is set to add a third plant in the state by 2030.\n\nTSMC’s future looks bright, and the stock is already up 44% YTD. The company also reported the fastest monthly revenue growth since 2022, with sales hitting $6.1 billion in one month, up 34% YOY.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoaring higher than Nvidia, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is up 235% YTD and 785% on the year. Trading for $937 today, the stock might look expensive, but it is worth your money. Directly related to Nvidia, SMCI will grow whenever Nvidia does. It integrates its motherboard designs with Nvidia processors and is one of the best out there right now.\n\nWhile SMCI is heavily dependent on Nvidia, I believe it has one of the best liquid cooling products in the industry and it gets early access to Nvidia’s chips. AI servers require the right cooling servers and that is where Super Micro Computer is set to benefit. It is looking at expanding production, which will help improve the financials.\n\nIt reported impressive financials in the fourth quarter, with net sales hitting $3.66 billion and EPS up 62%, hitting $5.10 per share. Analysts have a high price target for the stock, and the company has to live up to the expectations.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) isn’t making as much noise in the AI industry as its counterparts, it is still gaining momentum. The company is working on an affordable AI chip and still has a strong hold on Google Search and Google Cloud. These are the two highest revenue-generating segments for the company and contribute to the business growth.\n\nOne big reason to invest in Alphabet is its sheer potential to innovate. It is working on the new Arm-based AI CPU, which could be a game changer for the business. Alphabet is a highly stable company with a rich history, and its solid market share makes it one of the best tech stocks to own.\n\nThe stock is up 15% YTD and is trading for $160 right now. It looks highly undervalued to me, and analysts say it could hit $185 very soon. Oppenheimer analysts set a price target of $185 for the stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), is slowly growing its AI products. It launched a series of microchips designed for AI applications and is ready to take on Nvidia.\n\nThe company launched the MI300X microchip, which will be used for servers and data centers. Some of the top tech companies, including Microsoft, have been buying these chips. AMD stock is up 18% YTD and exchanging hands for $170. It is up 80% in the year and could hit $200 very soon.\n\nIf you think Nvidia is too expensive, now is the time to grab AMD before it skyrockets. Considered an industry underdog, the market is highly optimistic about the future of AMD. It is looking for sales of $5.4 billion in the first quarter, and I believe it will report strong fundamentals. AMD has a history of excelling in the industry, and any dip in the stock is a chance to buy.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies has been crushing the market with its AI prowess. Up 35% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $22 and is on a rally. The stock has soared since February after the company reported impressive numbers driven by the artificial intelligence platform (AIP) boot camps.\n\nThe company is making the most of the rising demand for cloud and has integrated AI into its products. It signed 103 deals worth at least $1 million in the fourth quarter and has a backlog of boot camps. Palantir saw a 70% YOY increase in commercial revenue in the quarter and a 55% rise in consumer count.\n\nAs mentioned above, Palantir’s partnership with Oracle is set to benefit the business, as its applications will be available through Oracle’s cloud infrastructure. I wrote about Palantir earlier and believe it has the potential to double your money. Considering the high demand for AI in the industry, Palantir is set to have an exceptional 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Top 15 Cities Where Millennials Are Moving in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the top 15 cities where millennials are moving in the US. If you would like to skip our discussion on the relocation trends, you can go to the Top 5 Cities Where Millennials Are Moving in the US.\n\nMillennials are leaving their mark on the United States both culturally and demographically. This population segment, which is fast approaching middle age, is currently the largest one in the US.\n\nIn 2022, 25% of millennials made a move to a different city, according to SmartAsset. By 2023, millennials comprised 18% of the total population relocating between states. Studies have identified three primary motives driving millennials to move: access to better and more affordable housing, the pursuit of new job opportunities, and the desire to establish their own households. Hence, it comes as no surprise that the best cities for millennial families and the best cities for single millennials offer a blend of job growth, low cost of living, affordable housing, and decent quality of life.\n\nAffordable housing is one of the key reasons millennials move to a new city. Data from a recent survey by GOBankingRates showed that 32% of all millennial respondents moved to different states within the last two years in search of more affordable housing options. Data from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies indicates a trend of millennials migrating to suburbs, where housing tends to be more budget-friendly compared to urban areas. Despite the attractiveness of urban amenities, the affordability factor outweighs the desire for proximity to such amenities in urban areas.\n\nClosely associated with affordable housing is lower cost of living, a trend observed in areas where millennials are relocating, as highlighted in the Annual 2023 United Van Lines National Movers Study. This study shows that a significant portion of Americans are relocating eastwards and southwards. Moreover, it reveals that people are moving to less expensive areas that offer amenities comparable to major metropolitan cities.\n\nStory continues\n\nImpact of Remote Work on Millennial Migration\n\nNew job opportunities or transfers are another reason driving millennials to relocate. Statistics show that 13% of millennials have moved within the last couple of years, specifically for employment reasons. Millennials exhibit a higher likelihood of moving between cities for job-related purposes compared to other generations. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has played a key role in promoting the trend of remote work. This newfound flexibility in work arrangements has led to an increasing preference for remote work among millennials, influencing their relocation decisions.\n\nThe preference for remote work among employees has led many Fortune 500 companies to continue hiring remote workers. Many of these companies have also made it to the Fortune Best Workplaces for Millennials 2023 list. These companies include Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS).\n\nAtlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), an Australian company providing products and solutions for project managers and software developers, has a “Team Anywhere” policy. This innovative program grants employees the freedom to work and live in any location where Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) has a presence. While some essential in-person interaction is encouraged with up to four annual office visits, the policy prioritizes remote work.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known technology company. Despite having luxurious office spaces, Nvidia remains committed to providing remote-working options for its employees. Currently, the company has over 26,000 employees.\n\nHubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) is another Fortune 500 firm offering remote working options. In a move to empower its workforce, HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) introduced a flexible work arrangement program in January 2021. This program provides employees with the autonomy to choose from three work models that best suit their needs and preferences, namely office-centric, remote, or hybrid. Top 15 Cities Where Millennials Are Moving in the US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the top 15 cities where millennials are moving in the US, we analyzed data from the US Census Bureau for over 250 medium to large-sized cities. Millennials were defined as individuals aged 25 to 44 years old. The cities have been ranked based on the rate at which millennials moved in as a percentage of the city's total population as of 2022. Furthermore, we have provided the number of millennials who relocated to each city in 2022 to give an idea of the scale of migration.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Chip Boom Champions: 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Quadruple Your Money",
        "content": "The emergence of artificial intelligence stands as a force ready to transform several prominent industries. Investors looking to seize a rare chance to capitalize on these gains have aimed their efforts at leading semiconductor stocks to quadruple their money. Such a move clearly makes sense.\n\nDemand for high-powered AI chips powering self-driving cars and medical diagnosis continues to soar. This growth isn’t hype — 2024 forecasts unprecedented market expansion. AI demands advanced chip structures for data handling and computations. These stocks enable investors to profit from AI’s explosive growth.\n\nSemiconductors revolutionize modern life. Consider investing in semiconductor stocks in April as long-term bets. These are three of the top players in the sector that I don’t think get enough love. Accordingly, those looking for a more diversified chips portfolio should look at the stocks investors are looking at now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst off the list is the Asian semiconductor company Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company’s Q1 earnings were recently released, and these numbers impressed investors with Taiwan Semi’s excellent results.\n\nTSMC stock surged as the company reported 16.5% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. The company’s March-quarter sales hit $18.86 billion, easily surpassing estimates of $18.26 billion. Previous-year sales were $16.62 billion, signaling strong growth over time. TSMC’s Q1 revenue rebounded after four quarters of decline. Clients include some of the most prominent names in this space, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAnalyst Charles Shi maintained a buy rating for TSM stock, raising his price target to $168 from R133. He cited TSMC’s strength in AI and said that despite the impact of an earthquake, the company expects to meet its full-year growth target. Shi predicts a Q3 recovery, and I’m in line with this view.\n\nThe company also holds 50% of the contract chip manufacturing market to add to this thesis.  It dominates the highest-performing computing sector. Alongside AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom, TSMC also shares the success of AI chips as these companies rely on TSMC. With cutting-edge chip tech like 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes, TSMC drives AI innovation. Bullish forecasts predict over 20% revenue growth in FY24. Expanding with new plants in Germany and Japan, TSMC leads the AI revolution.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPredicted to have an upward trajectory until 2027, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor stock every investor should have in their portfolio right now. Analysts predict a 25% rise to $1,215 per share by 2025. Progression suggests $1,500 in 2026 and nearly $1,900 by 2027, doubling the current value. ASML’s dominance in chip technology, especially EUV lithograph, which is crucial for AI, supports this potential growth.\n\nBased in the Netherlands, the company revolutionizes semiconductor production for Intel and TSMC using EUV light, creating ultra-thin lines on silicon. Its lithography dominance, shielded by patents, faces challenges from espionage and trade disputes.\n\nASML’s future shines bright, particularly in lithography. Mordor Intelligence forecasts over 11% annual growth for EUV lithography through 2029. Demand for high-performance chips, essential for AI, fuels ASML’s prospects, with Taiwan Semiconductor as a critical client. Moreover, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst’s note highlights favorable risk/reward in ASML, driven by AI momentum.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently upgraded by analysts, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) excels in semiconductor and display equipment, favored by JPMorgan(NYSE:JPM) with a $260 price target. Strategic positioning and tech advancements, like HBM and GAA, position the company well for market share growth in a projected $110 billion market by 2025. Q1 results surpassed forecasts, underlining its market strength and strategic accuracy.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald also upgraded Applied Materials to overweight, raising their price target to $260 per share. Expectations of a strong semiconductor equipment market drove this shift. Applied Materials’ strategic position and tech advancements, including HBM and GAA transistors, fuel optimism for market share growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ GAAP earnings were $2.41 per share, exceeding the non-GAAP $2.13.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 239%, thanks to unprecedented demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia continues to create value, and it's now worth $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe trillion-dollar club is incredibly exclusive, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms being the only other members. However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\n\nAMD's AI opportunity transcends the data center\n\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\n\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\n\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\n\nAMD could be poised for significant revenue growth\n\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\n\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\n\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\n\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAMD's (mathematical) path to a $1 trillion valuation\n\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\n\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\n\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are a buy as the Nasdaq continues to make higher highs. These companies have been benefiting from the growing demand for electronic devices and the increased adoption of various technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G.\n\nThe semiconductor industry’s ability to continuously innovate and develop more efficient, smaller, and faster chips is a reason investors should follow this industry closely.\n\nGenerally, semiconductor stocks outperform all others in the Nasdaq composite, so if one wants to have market-beating returns, then a sizable investment into this industry could be suitable. Although the ups and downs of the industry may be significant, I feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks involved.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo with this backdrop in mind, here are seven semiconductor stocks that I feel have a reasonable chance of turning $100,000 into $1 million within seven years. Don’t miss out on this opportunity or you may end up regretting it.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a significant share price increase of 84.66% over the past year. This surge is part of the company’s strategic shift from focusing on traditional PC sales to emphasizing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAMD’s growth in the AI sector is propelled by its Instinct MI300 accelerators, which aim to deliver an eightfold improvement in AI training performance compared to older models. The company anticipates generating around $2 billion from AI chip sales.\n\nThere is a strong market interest in AMD’s new offerings, with several large hyper-scale customers, potentially including high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), OpenAI, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWhat makes AMD a buy for me is that it has courted the attention of Wall Street analysts, as well as reaching meme stock status. It could then easily become a multibagger due to these combination of factors, which makes it one of those semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nSilicon Laboratories (SLAB) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSilicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB) is another one of those semiconductor stocks that investors should consider but it’s a different beast to the marquee names.\n\nThe reason I like SLAB is that it has a concentration into the IoT market, and also has a diversified base of earnings from customers from different industries. This diversification could provide a more stable earnings base compared to companies solely dependent on the more cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, SLAB’s shares have seen a significant decline of 21.24%% over the past year. This is where my thesis kicks in, as I believe that SLAB is undervalued when compared to its long-term potential.\n\nAlthough its P/E ratio is negative, it trades for just 5 times its sales, and looking ahead, analysts predict that it will reach breakeven profitability in the near future.\n\nThis then makes SLAB one of those semiconductor stocks that could turn $100,000 to $1 million as its fundamentals improve.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (MPWR) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is a company that has momentum firmly on its side. I covered MPWR back in November last year, and it has since gained around 20% at the time of writing.\n\nI remain firmly bullish on the potential of MPWR for the following reasons. First, the company’s management has projected a top-line growth of about 12% annually over the next three years, and analyst expectations are even more bullish.\n\nNamely, analysts predict that MPWR’s EPS will increase around 49% this year, and there is incremental growth expected for this company moving forward.\n\nDespite its market cap of around $30 billion, I think that it still has plenty of room for growth, as evidence by its long-term growth prospects that have been guided by management. It’s then one of those semiconductor stocks to investors to consider.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a significant move with the introduction of its Falcon Shores GPU, designed specifically for AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nTo get the most out of the AI craze, it’s also leveraging significant capital expenditure. This includes a substantial $20 billion investment in constructing two new chip fabrication facilities in Ohio.\n\nI think that INTC also falls under meme stock status due to being the primary underdog of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the chips arms race, which is a positive contributing factor when considering a semiconductor stock to buy.\n\nAnd despite it’s underdog status, I think it has a strong possibility of remaining competitive thru the announcement of its new AI chip. The chip, named Gaudi 3, boasts a 50% performance increase over Nvidia’s older H100 model in inference applications and offers 40% greater power efficiency at a lower cost. This is embelic of its ongoing efforts to carve out a space in the competitive AI accelerator market.\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (MX) AI. Circuit board. Technology background.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (NYSE:MX) designs and manufactures analog and mixed-signal semiconductors.\n\nI think that MX is primed for a rebound despite its stock price falling 40.55% over the past year.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a revenue uptick from approximately $240 million to $290 million in 2024, with estimates ranging from a low of $265 million to one analyst’s projection of $380 million for 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Magnachip boasts a net cash per share of around $4.2, alongside an active buyback program, having repurchased $25 million worth of shares in the last quarter and announcing an additional $50 million allocation.\n\nIf investors want to 10x their investment, it makes sense that risky investments are indeed that have high implied volatility. MX then ticks this box well, and I think it’s long-term prospects make it an attractive investment that should not be overlooked by those with strong ambitions in the industry.\n\nHua Hong Semiconductor (HHUSF) Here's How Broadcom Stock Fell Back into Favor with Investors\n\nSource: ©iStock.com/lef2481\n\nHua Hong Semiconductor (OTCMKTS:HHUSF) is one of the most prominent semiconductor stocks and chip foundries in China, and thus is worthy of one’s consideration.\n\nIn 2023, the company achieved a milestone by obtaining approval for a $2.6 billion listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest in China for the year. I think this move will expected to enhance its future positioning.\n\nMy thesis for HHUSF and other Chinese semiconductor stocks on this list is due to China’s turn to high-tech manufacturing and increase in internal consumption by the government’s top brass. HHUSF is employing its $2.6 billion listing to fuel its expansion and concentrate on specialized semiconductor technologies, and I believe that the majority of those chips will go towards China-based firms.\n\nAs the premier foundry in China, HHSUF will be vital in producing some of the components needed to fuel China’s high-tech pivot, and trading at around $2 per share, I think it has multibagger potential.\n\nIntchains Group (ICG) BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntchains Group (NASDAQ:ICG) is a provider of high-performance computing ASIC chips and software. ICG also has a notable presence in the blockchain industry, and is therefore tied to the ongoing and exponential growth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nThere are a few reasons I think that ICG could be an outperformer. For one, The company recently acquired assets from the Goldshell brand, based in Singapore, for $550,000. This acquisition includes intellectual property essential for Web3 infrastructure.\n\nIt also has $97 million in cash and short-term investments and minimal liabilities totaling $1.9 million. One can say that its fundamentals are strong, and due to its expanding presence in Web3, the future is accretive.\n\nICG is another company based in China, and despite the country outlawing Bitcoin mining, it remains as a key player in the industry and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. ICG along with HHUSF could then be complementary plays in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Billionaire Investors Are Selling Nvidia and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest game in town for investors. Much of the big gains for the stock market in 2023 and 2024 have been driven by surging interest in everything AI.\n\nNo company has been more at the forefront of the AI boom than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's share price skyrocketed 239% last year and is up close to 75% this year. But is the enthusiasm about Nvidia beginning to fade? Maybe so. Two billionaire investors are selling Nvidia and buying another AI stock instead.\n\nThumbs down to Nvidia\n\nDavid Tepper is known to many as the owner of the Carolina Panthers. However, he amassed enough money to buy the NFL franchise by achieving tremendous success with the hedge fund he founded in 1993, Appaloosa Management. Today, Tepper's net worth stands at $20.6 billion.\n\nTepper is bullish about AI. Eight of the top 10 holdings in Appaloosa's portfolio are AI stocks. Nvidia ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest position, but Tepper seems to think the stock's tremendous momentum could be near an end. In the fourth quarter of 2023, he sold almost 23% of Appaloosa's stake in the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker.\n\nHe isn't the only billionaire investor now noticeably less excited about Nvidia. Chase Coleman first made his mark in the investment world by working with legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Coleman next ran his own hedge fund, Tiger Global Management, which later expanded into venture capital. He's now worth $5.7 billion.\n\nTiger Global Management reduced its position in Nvidia in Q4 by nearly 13%. Nvidia still claims the No. 10 spot in the hedge fund's portfolio with a stake valued at roughly $480 million at the end of 2023. However, Coleman is taking some of his profits off the table with the stock after making big gains.\n\nThumbs up to Amazon\n\nBoth Tepper and Coleman saw Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as a better AI stock to buy in Q4. Tepper's Appaloosa fund increased its position in the e-commerce and cloud-services giant by more than 5%. Coleman's Tiger Global Management upped its stake in Amazon by 24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are these two billionaire investors more bullish about Amazon than Nvidia? I suspect Tepper and Coleman might think Nvidia's valuation is now at a level where any sign of trouble could cause a steep sell-off. At the same time, Amazon appears to be building sustainable momentum.\n\nAI is definitely a key growth driver for Amazon. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the top cloud-services provider based on market share. AWS is especially investing heavily in supporting generative AI development.\n\nAmazon is using generative AI internally as well. CEO Andy Jassy said in the company's Q4 earnings conference call, \"[W]e believe it [generative AI] will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nOf course, Amazon isn't just an AI stock. The company's efforts to increase profitability in its e-commerce business continue to pay off. Amazon has delivered seven consecutive quarters of improving operating margins in its North America business segment.\n\nIt has also become a key player in the digital-advertising market. Amazon's advertising revenue soared 26% year over year in Q4. And that growth came before the company launched its ads on Prime Video.\n\nBuying more shares of Amazon has already paid off for Tepper and Coleman. The stock is up over 20% year to date.\n\nShould you buy Amazon too?\n\nInvestors shouldn't sell Nvidia and buy Amazon only because two hedge fund billionaires have. However, it's not a bad idea to examine the potential reasons behind Tepper and Coleman's moves.\n\nI think the reasons Tepper and Coleman added more shares of Amazon in Q4 are still applicable now. The company's profits will likely continue to rise. AI and advertising remain strong growth drivers. Amazon is still an excellent long-term pick, in my view.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready for a Split",
        "content": "Many top technology stocks have completed stock splits in recent years, from Amazon to Alphabet, as their shares roared higher. The move involves a company issuing additional shares to current holders in order to lower the price of each individual share. This doesn't change the market value of the company or the value of your investment -- but it's positive for the company because it makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nAnd for investors, a stock split often signals that a company has been doing well and management expects the momentum to continue -- and that could, once again, drive up the shares over time. So it's worth taking a close look at stock-split companies, as some might make interesting long-term investments.\n\nCompanies that make great candidates for a split often are active in a high-growth industry and have seen their shares climb quickly, even reaching the $1,000 mark. This is the case for two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks right now. They haven't announced a split, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do so in the near future, thanks to their incredible performance over the past few years. Let's take a closer look at these AI stocks that look ready for a split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has climbed 500% over the past three years as the company established its position as the world's AI chip giant. The company sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most crucial steps in any AI project: the training and inferencing of AI models. This allows those models to then do what we'd like them to do, such as solve complex problems.\n\nThe tech giant's GPUs initially were known for powering video games and graphics, but the introduction of programming platform CUDA made it easy to use GPUs for general computing -- and this opened the door to using them for AI. Now, instead of generating most of its revenue from the video game business, Nvidia instead generates it from the data center business. Last year, revenue and profit soared in the triple digits, and considering we're in the early days of the AI boom, growth could continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has split its stock five times in the past, with the most recent operation happening in 2021 after the stock posted a period of gains -- and at that point, the shares traded for less than $250.\n\nThis year, Nvidia stock has climbed higher than $900, bringing it very close to the $1,000 level -- one that could dissuade some investors from buying the stock. Right now could be a great moment for this AI star to launch a stock split due to the current stock price and due to the fact that a new growth driver could be just ahead. The company plans on releasing its new Blackwell architecture and chips later this year, and growth from that platform could supercharge Nvidia stock.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has skyrocketed, even surpassing Nvidia when it comes to share performance in recent times. The stock has soared more than 2,200% over the past three years and climbed beyond $1,000 earlier this year before dipping to the current level of about $940.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro has seen its revenue stream transform thanks to demand for AI. The 30-year-old company, a maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment, announced its first $3 billion quarter ever just recently as AI customers flocked to its products. Supermicro works closely with top chipmakers including Nvidia so that it can quickly integrate their products into its platforms, and this has kept demand soaring to records. It also means that Supermicro benefits from not only its own new product releases, but the new chip releases from all the big chip companies -- from Nvidia to Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nCustomers also like Supermicro's products because they are specifically tailored to their needs, and the company's building blocks manner of construction means it can quickly fill orders.\n\nSupermicro's earnings have soared in recent times, and the company has made moves to maximize its economies of scale to keep the good times rolling. The tech giant is doing this by expanding production, with a new Malaysia facility to focus on lower costs and higher volume.\n\nSupermicro has never split its stock, but now would be the perfect time to launch such an operation, considering the stock's price today -- and the potential for a new wave of growth ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Is Down 11% From Record Highs: Will This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Development Bring More Bad News for Investors?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) hit record highs last month, with shares of the chipmaker jumping to $974 on March 8. But investors haven't had much reason to cheer since then, as this red-hot stock has been cooling down ever since.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia stock now trades just over 11% below that record high. Wall Street is worried that the stock's bubble may have popped, and its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered growth could fizzle out thanks to intensifying competition in the market for AI chips. So it wasn't surprising to see Nvidia stock retreat another 2% on April 9 following Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) launch of a new AI chip, which took direct aim at Nvidia's hottest performers.\n\nLet's see if Nvidia investors have reason to worry following Intel's latest move to target the fast-growing AI chip market.\n\nIntel takes aim at Nvidia's AI supremacy\n\nIntel has been trying hard to sink its teeth into the AI chip market, but the company's efforts have not gone far. At the end of 2023, Intel's potential revenue pipeline from AI chips was \"well above $2 billion and growing,\" according to CEO Pat Gelsinger. That pales in comparison to Nvidia's fiscal 2024 data center revenue of $47.5 billion, indicating that it is miles ahead of Intel in the AI chip market at present.\n\nHowever, Chipzilla is taking another shot at Nvidia's AI dominance with its latest Gaudi 3 accelerator. The press release announcing the launch pointed out that this new Intel chip is \"delivering 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100 -- at a fraction of the cost.\"\n\nThe press release went on to add that Gaudi 3 can reduce the time taken to train the Llama2 large language model (LLM) with 7 billion and 13 billion parameters -- as well as the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model -- by an estimated 50%. Intel added that multiple companies are set to deploy the Gaudi accelerators and server manufacturers, and Dell Technologies, Super Micro Computer, Lenovo, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are also expected to offer systems based on this new chip.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Intel claims that Gaudi 3 could equal the performance of Nvidia's upcoming H200 AI graphics processing unit (GPU). Given that Intel's latest AI chip is built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process, it is not a surprising claim. That's because Nvidia's current flagship, the H100, is manufactured using a custom 5nm process from TSMC.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's upcoming H200 processor is also going to be based on TSMC's N5 process, which refers to its 5nm process node. So investors may be thinking that Intel may indeed be able to cut into Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market thanks to a mix of aggressive pricing and solid performance.\n\nBut investors should note that Nvidia's H100 GPU was unveiled a couple of years ago, and it entered mass production later in 2022. Intel's Gaudi 3 chip is expected to enter mass production in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. But by the time Intel starts shipping these chips, Nvidia would have upped its game.\n\nDislodging Nvidia is easier said than done\n\nNvidia announced the Blackwell GPU architecture last month, claiming that this new platform will allow \"organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\"\n\nMoreover, the Blackwell B200 GPU is expected to be four times faster than the H100 during AI training and 30 times faster while inferencing. This massive jump in the B200's performance over the previous generation of Nvidia's GPUs can be attributed to the advanced 4nm process node on which the chip is built.\n\nEven better, Nvidia is reportedly going to price the Blackwell processors aggressively. And considering the performance and efficiency gains that Nvidia is promising, it may be able to mitigate any cost advantage that Intel is promising. All this explains why major cloud computing providers such as Amazon, Alphabet's Google, MetaPlatforms, Microsoft, and Oracle are expected to deploy the B200.\n\nNvidia says that chips based on the Blackwell architecture will be available later this year, indicating that the company could steal Intel's thunder and maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. Not surprisingly, Nvidia's data center revenue is expected to double in 2024 to $95 billion, according to analysts' estimates.\n\nThis suggests that the market is expecting Nvidia to remain the leading player in the AI chip market, where it reportedly commands a share of over 80%. So investors would do well to look past Intel's AI chip announcement, as the new Gaudi 3 processor may not pose much of a challenge to Nvidia considering that the latter is set to move to a new generation of more powerful and efficient chips.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can Taiwan Semiconductor Stock (NYSE:TSM) Replicate Nvidia’s Performance?",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chipmaker, recently posted impressive revenue figures for March. Notably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has gained 242.5% in the past year, relies on TSM for chip manufacturing. However, TSM’s stock performance (up 71.5% over the same period; see the comparison image below) has been relatively subdued. This begs the question: can TSM replicate NVDA’s stellar performance? The answer is likely a “yes.”\n\nWith the ongoing AI boom, increased funding from the U.S., and an attractive valuation, TSM looks like a compelling buy right now.\n\nPre-Earnings Numbers Point to Positive Outlook for Upcoming Earnings\n\nOn April 10, TSM unveiled impressive revenue figures for March, marking the highest month-over-month growth since November 2022 at 34.3% year-over-year, totaling 195.2 billion New Taiwan dollars (approximately $6.1 billion). Additionally, Q1 revenues are projected to increase by 16.5% year-over-year, reaching 592.6 billion New Taiwan dollars (around $18.4 billion).\n\nIt’s worth noting that TSM anticipates mid-20% revenue growth for FY 2024, fueled by strong demand for its latest nano chips amid the AI surge. Moreover, the company reaffirmed in January 2024 that its AI revenues are growing rapidly at approximately 50% annually. This reaffirmation is particularly reassuring following the revenue decline reported in 2023.\n\nTSM manufactures the chips and supplies them to tech titans like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Ahead of its Q1 earnings release expected on April 18, let’s take a look at what the future holds for TSM.\n\nAI Revolution Will Spur Growth at TSM\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm. I firmly believe that its growth trajectory is enduring. The AI industry, still in its infancy, is projected to witness remarkable expansion across diverse industries and applications. According to Next Move Strategy Consulting, the industry is anticipated to burgeon into a $1.85 trillion behemoth by 2030, compared to around $208 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSM’s customers heavily rely on the company for the production of chips they design. An uproar in demand for everything AI has led to a huge demand for AI chips.\n\nTo add to the AI growth spurt, TSM got yet another boost to its manufacturing operations, as it received approval for direct federal funding worth $11.6 billion under the U.S. government’s CHIPS Act. The company will receive $6.6 billion in grants to expand its manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition, TSM is eligible for an incremental loan of $5 billion.\n\nTSM has already invested in building two plants at the site and will use the funding to build an additional factory. The firm’s total investment across all three factories is estimated at $65 billion. This marks the “largest foreign direct investments in a greenfield project in U.S. history,” according to the press release.\n\nTSM plans to produce 2-nanometer technology chips at the second factory starting in 2028. In the coming years, TSM should reap the benefits of massive investments that will greatly enhance its manufacturing operations and bring in the latest technological advancements.\n\nSharing his optimism, TSM Chairman Mark Liu stated, “Our U.S. operations allow us to better support our U.S. customers, which include several of the world’s leading technology companies. Our U.S. operations will also expand our capability to trailblaze future advancements in semiconductor technology.”\n\nTo date, the majority of TSM’s manufacturing capabilities are based in Taiwan, which poses a geographical risk (potential threat of Chinese invasion, earthquakes, etc.). With the latest expansion announcement, that risk will be alleviated. With increased manufacturing in the U.S., TSM will likely more efficiently cater to its top-notch clients like Nvidia, AMD, and Apple based in the U.S. On top of that, record-high crypto prices are creating higher demand for chips, adding to TSM’s growth outlook.\n\nTSM Is Trading at a Cheap Valuation\n\nIn terms of its valuation, TSM looks cheap. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 23x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices is trading at a higher forward P/E multiple (49x), while the AI prodigy Nvidia is trading at a forward P/E of 36.4x.\n\nWall Street analysts expect TSM’s EPS to reach $9.02 in FY 2026. If TSM keeps the same forward P/E multiple by then, its share price will be about $207, 45% higher than the current price. Therefore, it makes sense to consider buying TSM stock at current levels, given the strong growth potential in the AI space.\n\nIs TSM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys. TSM stock’s average price target of $154.14 implies 8.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: TSM Presents a Strong Opportunity for Long-Term Growth\n\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant surge, largely driven by the AI boom. TSM, along with its AI-focused counterparts, stands to gain from this relentless demand. With strategic investments and expansion plans in place to meet future demands, TSM appears well-positioned for sustained growth. Considering these factors, I am inclined to buy the stock at its current levels, anticipating long-term benefits from its AI potential.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Whether you believe them or not, analyst ratings have long been a strong indicator of the stock price’s direction. There is a direct correlation between how Wall Street analysts rate a stock and how it performs. After all, analysts aren’t just pulling these price targets out of thin air. They use complex formulas that include analyzing the company’s past and present fundamentals to predict its future price multiple.\n\nSo should we blindly follow analyst ratings or price targets? We shouldn’t ever just rely on one rating to buy a stock. Rather, we should use analyst ratings as one indicator combined with other research like fundamentals and technical analysis. If you are looking for some stocks to watch in April, check out these Wall Street analyst favorites.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. As of April 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap with a value of $1.3 trillion. Meta is a favorite of Wall Street analysts and is currently trading right at its average price target of $519.12. The top end of the price target range sits at $600.00, representing a further 14% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn March alone, Meta received 60 analyst ratings, 20 of which were a Strong Buy with 32 more being a Buy rating. This is almost as consensus as it gets among Wall Street analysts. Meta has more than two billion daily active users (DAU) across its platforms and has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the past five years.\n\nDespite gaining more than 145% over the past year, Meta’s stock has gotten cheaper on a price multiple basis. It is now trading at just 10x sales and 26x forward earnings. This makes Meta cheaper than peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NYSE:UBER) is the global leader in ride-sharing with over 130 million monthly active users in more than 70 countries worldwide. The stock has an average price target of $86.56 from analysts which represents an 11% upside from Uber’s current price. The Street-high analyst price target is $100 per share.\n\nEarlier this year, Uber reported its first-ever profitable quarter. This came on the heels of Uber being added to the S&P 500 just a couple of months earlier in December 2023. Now, with the company finally at scale and its delivery growth soaring, analysts are calling Uber a stock to buy. In March, 45 of 48 analyst ratings were a Buy or Strong Buy which indicates just how much Wall Street loves this stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsually, there are some valuation concerns after a stock has gained 143% over the past year. It depends on which metric you use with Uber. The stock is trading at a lofty 60x forward earnings but only four times sales. This divergence is usually caused by rapidly growing revenue with minimal profits, which is exactly the case for Uber. Its revenue has grown at a three-year CAGR of 50%!\n\nTransMedics Group (TMDX) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) is an American medical device and technology company that was founded in 1998. This stock isn’t the most widely covered company, but analysts do have an average price target of $99.40. TMDX is currently trading at a lower price than the lowest end of the one-year analyst price target range of $95.00.\n\nThis company has a market cap of just $2.8 billion and is far from being profitable, but a deeper dive tells you exactly why analysts love this stock. TMDX is the largest ex-vivo organ transplantation company in the world. It designs and implements new technologies to safely transport organs from donors to patients. Some analysts with an Overweight or Strong Buy rating include Oppenheimer, TD Cowen, and most recently initiated by Piper Sandler.\n\nDespite being unprofitable and in hyper-growth mode, TMDX only trades at 11.4x sales even after seeing year-over-year revenue growth of 158.7%. Over the past three years, TMDX has seen a revenue CAGR of 111%. TMDX is an industry leader growing at an exponential rate and it is only a matter of time until the stock price follows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In a setting historically dominated by male leadership, women at the helm of major corporations is still considered something of a novelty. You don’t see many articles about a company’s first male CEO, but there’s always a buzz when the first woman gets hired to the same position.\n\nAs of January 2023 only 10% of the Fortune 500 companies were run by a woman. That’s surprising considering a study conducted by S&P Global found that in the two years following their appointment, “female CEOs saw a 20% increase in stock price momentum.” Companies with more gender diversity on their board of directors are also more profitable.\n\nInvestors may not specifically consider stocks with women CEOs when looking at here to invest. However, the women on this list and the companies they represent are great examples of how female leadership can turn a company around or help it continue to thrive in an otherwise tumultuous market. Their different upbringings and paths to business bring a unique perspective that can change the outlook of a company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nMary Barra has been the CEO of General Motors (NYSE:GM) since January 2014. She is the first female CEO of the “Big Three” automakers that includes Ford (NYSE:F) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). She is currently the only female CEO in the U.S. auto industry.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), GM stock is up 23.51%. According to Tip Ranks, it has the best price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of all its competitors at 6.04. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently struggling, stands at 38.32. GM has a 15.69% upside with an average price target of $51.17. Based on 19 ratings, analysts consider GM a moderate buy, but Barra has a history of navigating GM through some of its toughest challenges. The future of the company looks bright under her continued leadership.\n\nIn her time as CEO, Barra has spearheaded the process of modernizing General Motors, focusing on the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and improving customer experience. She has also championed the cause of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which many business executives believe is important for positive business growth. Thanks to her efforts and successes, she was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nThe average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO is 7.2 years for men and 4.5 years for women. Clearly Barra is doing something right. Not only has she doubled the time in her position as the average female CEO but outperformed her male counterparts as well. Her length of time in the job must mean she’s doing something right. As the auto industry continues to face challenges, Barra’s strong leadership at GM make it not just one of the great stocks with women CEOs, but also a great choice for automotive stocks as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVS Health (CVS) the storefront of a CVS pharmacy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKaren Lynch has been CEO of CVSHealth (NYSE:CVS) since February 2021. While she’s only been at the company a short time, she has made waves with her new approach to the healthcare industry. Part of her grand plan for CVS is to create better health outcomes in the community, including a focus on how the company addresses Medicare as the ever-increasing senior population turns 65.\n\nWith a current average price target of $87.88, CVS stock has a 17.83% upside. While YTD it’s down 8%, it’s doing considerably better than rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is down 28% in the same time frame. Walgreens is not doing well right now, while CVS’ performance in 2023 points toward a much healthier future. Recently, the quarterly dividend for CVS was increased by 10%, indicating confidence in the company’s financial future.\n\nLynch recently published “Taking Up Space: Get Heard, Deliver Results, and Make a Difference.” In it, she chronicles her rise to becoming CEO of the sixth-largest Fortune 500 company. Her barrier-breaking attitude towards life is mirrored in her approach to business, and that bodes well for CVS.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLisa Su has been the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) since October 2014. Like Barra, Su has held her position as CEO longer than most others on the Fortune 500 list. She has also led the company through one of the greatest recent turnarounds in the technology sector.\n\nIf you invested $10,000 at the time Su became CEO, you’d have over $430,000 today. The company was on the edge of bankruptcy when she took over. Her vision, though, led the company to shed its investments in unnecessary divisions. Instead, she honed in on its money-makers: high-performance central and graphics processing units (CPUs and GPUs).\n\nWhile Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to be every investor’s favorite tech stock darling right now, AMD is a solid competitor. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is actually a first cousin once removed of Su, so they’ve kept their success in the family. Despite concerns that both AMD and Nvidia are overvalued, some think AMD is still a good buy. According to TipRanks, there’s still a potential 18.56% upside in comparison to NVDA’s 12.65%. Su’s unique perspective as a female leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sector might just provide the edge the company needs to outperform its industry sibling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "Why AMD (AMD) Stock Is Nosediving\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 5.1% in the morning session after the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials told major telecoms companies in the country to \"phase out foreign chips that are critical to their networks.\" This could affect chip manufacturers such as AMD, with a presence in the country. According to AMD's latest annual report, China accounted for more than 10% of the revenue generated in 2023.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAMD's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 24 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 24 days ago, when the company dropped 6.3% on the news that competitor Nvidia announced a new AI chip family called Blackwell at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC). NVDA's event raised the bar for the industry. For instance, the company gave a specific example of a 75% reduction in power consumption for an LLM training project on Blackwell vs Hopper, an existing chip line. In addition, NVDA is also investing heavily into and making quick progress in the areas of services, omniverse, and robotics. To keep pace, competitors may need to invest more or face reduced market share.\n\nAMD is up 17.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $162.93 per share it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,854.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "Nvidia NVDA, a major player in chipmaking, recorded a notable downturn in its stock value this week. It entered a \"correction territory\" on Apr 10, 2024, but closed the day at about 8% lower than the peak, per a CNBC article. However, the shares have jumped 4.1% on Apr 11, 2024.\n\nReasons Behind the Decline\n\nThe exact cause for the decline remains uncertain. However, ripe valuation can be a cause of concern. It's possible that investors are booking profits as Nvidia shares topped 200% gains over the past year. Additionally, the unveiling of a new AI chip by rival Intel, touted for its efficiency in powering large language models, could have contributed to the downward pressure, per the above-mentioned article.\n\nAnalyst Insights and Future Projections\n\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson see a potential shift in the AI arena, with a forecasted reduction in demand for Nvidia's products over time. While anticipating strong performance from Nvidia in the near term, they express concerns about future prospects, citing factors such as diminishing model sizes, steady growth in demand, evolving investments by major players and increased reliance on proprietary chips by Nvidia's largest clients. This outlook hints at a looming cyclical downturn for Nvidia by 2026.\n\nPattern of Brokers’ Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAbout 15 analysts covering the stock, 11 analysts upped earnings estimates for the April quarter over the last 60 days while four raised estimates over the past month. None made downward estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current quarter has been raised to $5.44 from $5.32.\n\nBroker Rating\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 40 recommendations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 87.5%, while Buy represented 5%.\n\nNvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock comes from a top-ranked Zacks sector (top 31%) and Zacks industry (top 10%).\n\nIs Nvidia Overvalued?\n\nThe forward P/E ratio of the stock is 36.70, way higher than 24.57 recorded by the underlying industry. Price-sales ratio stands at 35.72, much higher than 2.56 delivered by the industry. Earnings yield of NVDA was 2.73% as of Apr 10, 2024, lower than the underlying industry’s figure of 3.78%. However, Nvidia is cash-rich. Its cash flow per share is $12.41, way above $4.94 recorded by the industry. This means the company has enough cash to invest in the future growth prospects.\n\nModerate Upside Ahead in Short-Term?\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $914.75. The forecasts range from a low of $475.00 to a high of $1,200.00.

        "content": "The collective of leading technology companies, often referred to as the Magnificent Seven, has seen an increase in their dominance within the S&P 500 Index, despite not all members performing to expectations. This group, which includes some of the most influential names in the tech industry, has expanded its share of the index, now representing nearly a third of its value, surpassing several other major sectors combined.\n\nEven with varied performance among its members, this tech ensemble has reached a new peak in its contribution to the benchmark index. This rise is attributed to the remarkable gains of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared by approximately 81% due to the high demand for its AI computing chips. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also seen significant increases in their stock values, with jumps of 47% and 24%, respectively. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have surpassed the overall S&P 500's performance, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a decline of about 9%.\n\nConversely, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen its shares decrease by around 30% this year, as the electric vehicle manufacturer grapples with slowing demand and investor uncertainty regarding its recovery prospects.\n\nThese tech giants' growing influence within the S&P 500 underscores the significant impact the technology sector has on the broader market, even as individual companies within the group experience varying degrees of success.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Billionaire Leon Cooperman’s Family, Children and Investments",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Leon Cooperman's family, children and investments. If you want to skip our detailed overview of one of the most successful billionaires in Wall Street history, then you can skip ahead to Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Family, Children, and Investments: Top 5 Stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to shrewd takes on the stock market, you're unlikely to find too many that lag behind Leon Cooperman's analysis of the stock market and the broader financial environment in the United States. Over the course of his career, the billionaire has seen it all. An octogenarian, Cooperman started his career in 1967 - an era on Wall Street that was yet to be dominated by mega cap technology stocks. Back then, Wall Street investors were facing their own historic environment. While right now folks in the hedge fund and the broader finance industry are adjusting to an era of high interest rates and the 'end of free money' as Mr. Cooperman would put it, in the late 1960s, they were rejoicing on the Federal Reserve's decision to allow a portion of stock purchases to be funded by taking out loans.\n\nNaturally, this meant that more stocks changed hands and the euphoria would continue for the next couple of years until rising costs and dwindling interest led to the government stepping in and helping brokers manage the market. In this turmoil, Cooperman was working for the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and he would continue to work for the bank until 1991, a period that would see him live through one of the most well known and devastating stock market crashes called Black Monday. A couple of years after Black Monday, Cooperman would leverage the skills he learned while managing stocks for one of the biggest investment banks in the world to try his own hand at wealth and fame by setting up a private investment partnership.\n\nWhile working at Goldman saw the famed investor make his mark on Wall Street by winning laurels, on the personal side, he had already achieved milestones. Characteristic of folks from his generation, even before Cooperman started working for Goldman to set him on a path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, he had already married his wife Toby Cooperman in 1964. Like Cooperman, Mrs. Cooperman also attended New York's Hunter College and graduated in the year of their marriage. During their time in college, the pair were quite close and would take up class positions such as president and vice president.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe start of Cooperman senior's journey at Goldman Sachs was accompanied by his six month old toddler, and today, he has two sons, Wayne Cooperman and Michael Cooperman. Both of these have followed their father into the finance industry, and Wayne Cooperman even has his own hedge fund called Cobalt Capital Management. Michael Cooperman, on the other hand, is more involved in his family's charitable endeavors and has been known to work at the Leon & Toby Cooperman Foundation. Cooperman Sr. is quite charitable too, and like several other well known hedge fund and investment professionals such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Mario Gabelli of GAMCO, he has also signed the giving pledge.\n\nWayne's trysts in the finance industry have also generated their fair share of controversy. One infamous period in Cooperman Sr.'s long and illustrious career on Wall Street was in 2010 when he had yet to shut down his investment firm. Back then, the billionaire's investment firm had held a stake in the oil and gas midstream company Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. Atlas announced a $682 million sale of an asset to the Canadian firm Enbridge, and Cooperman Sr. was accused of improperly profiting from the deal by buying more Atlas Pipeline shares with the inside knowledge that the deal would be announced soon. To make things interesting, the accusations tipped off the SEC to investigate Cooperman, who started to look into the matter purportedly after Wayne Cooperman noticed unusual derivative activity for Atlas shares right when the deal was to be announced.\n\nIn a rather interesting set of events, it appeared as if Cooperman Sr. had raised his son to detest insider trading while all the while trading stocks with inside knowledge himself! The saga lasted for six years, and despite the SEC offering him to settle in return for a five year ban, the investor stood his ground and settled for a fine without admitting to any wrongdoing.\n\nSince then, Cooperman shut down his firm in 2018 after he grew tired of the fast paced and stressful nature of professionally investing in stocks. He now invests through his family office Omega Advisors, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Mr. Cooperman's family office had a portfolio value of $2 billion by the end of last year's fourth quarter.\n\nSo, which stocks is the legendary investor who was voted the number one portfolio strategist by Institutional Investors for nine consecutive years investing in? We took a look at Leon Cooperman's investment portfolio today, and some names that stick out are Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP), and Apollo Global Management, Inc.

        "title": "GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN &amp; META Pose Threat to NVDA With In-House Chips",
        "content": "As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) race heats up primarily due to a boom in the generative AI space, the demand for cutting-edge chips that can handle AI-related massive workloads keeps rising. These chips are equipped with strong computing power that makes the training of large language models seamless.\r\n\r\nIn this backdrop, strong endeavors being made by the cloud trio — Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL — as well as the social media giant Meta Platforms META, to put their AI-specific customized chips on the table remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis underscores the idea of staying self-sufficient in the intensifying AI battle in order to accelerate the development process of AI models, which, in turn, will help them pace up advancements in the AI world.\n\nWill NVIDIA Face Challenges?\n\nNVIDIA NVDA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is riding on solid demand for its next-generation chips for AI models. Reportedly, it holds more than 90% of the AI chips market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, the strategy of building in-house chips of these tech giants in order to reduce dependency on outside chip providers does not bode well for NVIDIA. It will stiffen the chip competition for NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nAlso, NVDA will start losing market share if its major customers start making their chips. This is a major concern.\r\n\r\nNotably, the waiting time for its flagship AI chip is months long, which is causing the scarcity. Nvidia can produce only a limited number of chips at a time because it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor to assemble the chip designs.\r\n\r\nThis is the primary reason why AI behemoths are now coming up with their chips.\r\n\r\nEven if the chips being made by Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are not as strong as NVIDIA’s, they can be customized. This will not only save their costs but will also save time.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow GOOGL, META, MSFT & AMZN Fare in AI Chip Race?\n\nAlphabet’s Google recently heated the AI battle with the introduction of its central processing unit (CPU), namely Axion, to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are marked as the company’s first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nAlphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, intends to scale Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine and the YouTube Ads platform on Axion soon.\r\n\r\nGoogle will make Axion available to its cloud customers later this year. Customers will be able to use Axion in cloud services like Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow and Cloud Batch.\r\n\r\nFollowing Google’s move, Meta announced advanced infrastructure for AI to push deep into the AI chip race. It introduced the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. Notably, MTIA is the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s advancement over MTIA v1 — its first-generation AI inference accelerator, which was designed in-house with Meta’s AI workloads.\r\n\r\nNotably, MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth. It is capable of managing the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users, seamlessly. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft unveiled two customized chips, namely Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, late last year. While the Arm-based Cobalt 100 is made for general computing tasks, Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes.\r\n\r\nNotably, Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like LLM training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors. The Zacks Rank #3 company collaborated with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. It is currently being tested on Bing’s AI chatbot Copilot, the GitHub Copilot coding assistant and GPT-3.5-Turbo.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, unveiled AWS Trainium2 chips made for training and running AI models. These chips are designed to power the highest-performance compute on AWS for training foundation models quickly at a lower cost, while consuming less energy. Further, they are capable of delivering up to 4 times better performance and two times better energy efficiency than the first-generation Trainium, which was introduced in 2020.\r\n\r\nNotably, a cluster of 100,000 Trainium chips can train a 300-billion parameter AI large language model in weeks versus months. Trainium 2 chips will be available in Amazon EC2 Trn2 instances, containing 16 Trainium chips in a single instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With its growing exposure to cloud technology and generative AI products and services, Celestica is a solid, strong buy option. CLS is poised to continue its upward trajectory and still offer investors a fair valuation.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

It also provides hardware and software for a machine learning and generative AI platform.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Nvidia announced its earnings result for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, stating that total revenue more than tripled to just over $22 billion year-over-year. Earnings per share for Q4 FY 2023 were fifty-seven cents, and for Q4 FY 2024, they increased to four dollars and ninety-three cents. Most notably, its data center revenue rose more than fivefold, and its professional visualization segment saw its total sales double year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter this stellar earnings report that beat analysts’ expectations, its share price surged by over 16% and has continued to experience growth.\n\nNvidia is a very strong option for investors seeking exposure to the technology industry, which has been on a very impressive trajectory recently. Strong attention is being placed on the burgeoning generative AI industry and other related fields in which NVDA is a massive player. This has assisted in the large increase in Nvidia’s share price, which has more than tripled since April 2023.\n\nViant Technology (DSP) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration.

It has seen a resurgence in investors’ interest following its dramatic decline in 2021, when it started trading publicly.\n\nInvestors are seeking greater exposure to the online advertising industry, which has been performing very well lately. Such is the case with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), for example. Its advertising revenue is its most profitable segment, which increased in revenue by over 24% from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023.\n\nOn Mar. 4, earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023 were released, stating that total revenue increased by 18% year-over-year. It reported a net loss of 8 million for Q4 2022 and a net income of $3.3 million in Q4 2023. These earnings were mostly in line with what analysts expected. It announced first-quarter guidance in which expected revenue should land in the range of $49 million to $52 million.\n\nViant had a rough start in 2021 going public, but more recently, it has performed remarkably well through the last year. With the growing importance of online advertising, it is a great time for investors to look into investing in DSP, which is still trading at a great valuation and could offer significant upside with a strong buy rating.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "One of the most successful and prominent companies in the world that investors should not miss out on is Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Since 2004, which was their IPO year, GOOG stock has been attractive. Due to its constant stock splits, a $100 investment back in the year would be valued at $1.2 million now.\n\nDespite its strong position in search, cloud, and YouTube, Alphabet’s stock trades at a low valuation, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.5-times and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.5-times, considering its substantial net cash. The company’s underrated AI initiatives, particularly in cloud services, contribute to its long-term appeal, aiding deal expansion.\n\nWhile Alphabet may yield different returns than in its early years, it remains a solid investment for potential millionaires.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm-Based AI Chip\n\nAt Alphabet’s cloud computing event, partnerships and products showcased the potential for Google’s stock. Google unveiled a custom AI chip based on Arm Holding’s architecture to empower cloud customers. Additionally, the event introduced the A3 Mega AI processor utilizing Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 technology, with plans to integrate Nvidia’s Blackwell platform by 2025.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s CEO, Thomas Kurian, unveiled the company’s inaugural custom AI chip, Google Axion, leveraging Arm’s AI architecture. Tailored for high-performance internet data center servers, it’s set for release in late 2024.\n\nUnlike past practices, Alphabet will offer these chips exclusively through cloud services for business rentals. Despite five generations of Tensor processing unit chips since 2015, Google has yet to market them directly to external clients.\n\nAlliance with Palo Alto Networks\n\nAmid the rise of generative AI, tech giants rush to develop training models utilizing proprietary data. Alphabet aims to license its Gemini large language model globally while expanding its cloud computing partnership with cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nThe cybersecurity company reiterated its commitment to securing Google Cloud with a generous investment. Palo Alto also named Alphabet their preferred provider for infrastructure services and artificial intelligence.\n\nPalo Alto Network CEO Nikesh Arora is optimistic about the partnership with Alphabet. The company also to expand more of its security services in different sectors.\n\nMore Than Just a Search Engine\n\nAlphabet currently holds the largest market share in search engines worldwide. In 2023, Alphabet reported a whopping 8% increase in revenue compared to 2022, when it had $175 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the same year, its cloud business also saw an excellent revenue growth of 26%, surpassing average growth rate. While Google Cloud recently turned profitable, its scale is crucial due to significant fixed costs. YouTube, another critical sector, saw an 8% revenue increase to $31.5 billion, with its premium services boasting over 100 million subscribers and contributing $15 billion.\n\nThough there are concerns about AI disrupting Google’s search dominance, the potential for AI to monetize non-advertised searches presents a significant opportunity for Alphabet’s future growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "The stock market has enjoyed a good run to start the year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up by roughly 10% year-to-date. However, these indices are likely to face resistance soon.\n\nStocks don’t continue to march up higher. They will face resistance and go through corrections. A correction occurs when a stock, index, or fund loses at least 10% of its value from its peak. Assets only exit their corrections after claiming fresh all-time highs.\n\nCorrections and market downturns can feel intimidating when they happen, especially if this is one of your first corrections. However, these corrections present long-term opportunities for investors. People fretted in 2016, 2017, 2018, and in other years that exhibited slight dips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCorrections are normal and healthy for the stock market in the long run, but these corrections create discounts. Make sure you look into these must-buy stocks whenever the market falters.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has outperformed the stock market for many years thanks to its highly profitable advertising business. Google and YouTube dominate the industry and continue to grow. Google Advertising revenue jumped from $59.0 billion in Q4 2022 to $65.5 billion in Q4 2023. That’s an 11% year-over-year increase.\n\nGoogle Cloud was another big winner, generating $9.2 billion in revenue during the quarter. That’s a 25.7% year-over-year growth rate. Alphabet as a whole reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 52% year-over-year net income growth. The company’s profit margins reached 24% which is a 33.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts are feeling optimistic about the stock. Alphabet has a “Strong Buy” rating and a projected 8% upside. The highest price target of $180 per share suggests that the stock can reward shareholders with an 18% gain at current levels.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) checks many of the boxes for growth investors. The company has high revenue growth, users rushing to create accounts and engage with the app, and a switch to profitability. Net income reached $12.1 million in Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of $13.9 million in the same period last year.\n\nThe educational tech company helps millions of people learn new languages. It’s also expanded into other subjects like math and music. The app had 26.9 million daily active users in Q4 2023 which is 65% higher than the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEverything’s going smoothly for the company, but investors will have to swallow a lofty valuation. Duolingo shares currently trade at a 128-forward P/E ratio. The corporation is poised to expand its profit margins and tap into growing markets. That’s why analysts are still projecting a 15% upside for the stock. Some analysts set even more aggressive price targets. A market pullback will make Duolingo’s valuation more attractive.

Expanding profit margins have made the stock easier to justify, but a pullback would make the stock look more desirable.\n\nInvestors shouldn’t expect these growth rates to last forever. Revenue reached $22.1 billion in the quarter which is a 22% improvement from Q3 FY24. Sequential revenue growth is still impressive but is slowing down. Full-year revenue increased by 126% year-over-year.\n\nWhile year-over-year growth rates are set to decelerate after Q1 FY25 thanks to challenging benchmarks set by last year’s hypergrowth, the stock still offers growth opportunities. Nvidia shares currently trade at a 36.5 forward P/E ratio and a 1.19 PEG ratio.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) An image of the Caterpillar tractor brand logo.\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been on a roll with a 169% gain over the past five years. The construction equipment company has also gained 30% year-to-date after another quarter of rising profit margins. The company reported 3% year-over-year revenue growth and 84% year-over-year net income growth in Q4 2023. Those results helped the company turn in a 15.7% net profit margin.\n\nThe stock has an 18 P/E ratio. The valuation hasn’t been this high since the end of 2021. Caterpillar has delivered steady EPS gains over the past few years. Continued growth can make the P/E ratio become more reasonable, but it’s still a better value stock than many contenders.\n\nCaterpillar also offers a 1.37% yield and an impressive dividend growth rate. The company’s dividend has maintained an annualized 8.20% growth rate for the past decade. Caterpillar only has a 24.80% dividend payout ratio which leaves the door open for more dividend hikes.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best stocks to buy on a pullback. The corporation has consistently outperformed the stock market and is up by 252% over the past five years. The $3 trillion tech conglomerate is expanding its market share in multiple industries like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, software, and cybersecurity.\n\nCopilot can open up new opportunities for the company. The recent launch of Copilot for Security offers an additional revenue stream and further establishes Microsoft as a cybersecurity leader. While the company has many exciting avenues for future growth, cloud computing is the company’s most important segment.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud grew by 24% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and came to $33.7 billion. Revenue for Microsoft as a whole increased by 18% year-over-year to reach $62.0 billion. Net income increased by 33% year-over-year. Microsoft’s ability to expand profit margins and tap into many industries makes it a compelling long-term stock. A short-term drop due to general weaknesses in the stock market can result in a good buying opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, NOW, NVDA, and MSFT.

        "content": "While robotics has been transforming major industrial spaces for decades, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) could create even more efficiencies in this burgeoning field. In particular, with the advent of novel AI technologies, robotics could enter a new era of growth. Older industries, such as manufacturing and healthcare, as well as newer ones will benefit from automation in one way or another. iShares Automation & Robotics ETF (OTCMKTS:IIVPF), which holds some 153 robotics and automation linked stocks, has risen more than 23% over the past 12 months, underscoring investors are interested in this sector.\n\nWall Street has also made it clear which robotics stocks are their favorite. Below are three of them to help balance investors’ long-term returns with exposure to cutting-edge technologies in April 2024.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is a leader in autonomous warehouse solutions, which use AI to optimize the storage, retrieval and transportation of goods. Symbotic’s warehouse solutions consist of software, robots and racks that work together to increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of warehouse operations. While SYM’s revenue has doubled consecutively since 2020, management expects there to be more recurring revenue and, therefore, top-line predictability as more products are deployed. Symbotic ended 2023 on a high note. Top-line figures ended the year at $1.2 billion, representing a jaw-dropping 98% year-over-year increase from Symbotic’s 2022 revenue figures. The AI-enabled robotics firm is currently trading at around 13.8x forward sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere are about 15 analysts covering Symbotic’s shares, and 12 have rated the automation firm’s shares either a “Buy” or “Strong Buy.” If we step back a little and review the sector in which Symbotic operates, it’s not difficult to see why. While older industries have been slower to adopt digital transformation trends, they stand to benefit the most from them. Although SYM’s shares have taken a dip in 2024, likely due to its high trading multiple, the automation firm’s strategy to engage on both the software and hardware aspect of the automation space could give create long-term growth tailwinds and shareholder value.\n\nHitachi (HTHIY) the hitachi logo on a building\n\nSource: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking about bridging novel AI technologies and industrial automation, our next entry on the list is doing just that. Hitachi (OTCMKTS:HTHIY), a Japanese industrial conglomerate, which makes swaths of industrial equipment to robots, announced a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to help bring generative AI to the forefront of its businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI has created efficiencies in a number of enterprise and consumer applications. However, it has yet to make its way into the industrial sphere of the market. These kinds of spaces in which Hitachi operates require heavy amounts of capital investment, and while interest rates remain elevated and will be that way for the foreseeable future, companies operating warehouses, logistics sites, or manufacturing facilities are going to look for ways to reduce their long-term costs. Digital transformation through generative AI could bring these cost efficiencies into fruition.\n\nThe conglomerate expects to utilize Nvidia’s Omniverse technology to simulate and optimize industrial processes. Moreover, Hitachi will also be combining its own Lumada AI library with Nvidia’s AI Enterprise and Modulus platforms to help customers, operating in a range of industries, to create their own AI-centric solutions.\n\nAlong with creating automation tools for the industrial sector, Hitachi has also developed several robotics technologies, including an autonomous dual arm that creates efficiencies in the logistics space.\n\nHitachi’s shares have beat the market, rising more than 28% on a year-to-date basis, yet they remained relatively undervalued, trading at only 23.6x forward earnings.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) continues to play an influential role in transforming the way in which surgeons operate complicated surgical procedures. This robotics firm is the pioneer and market leader in robotic-assisted surgery. The company’s flagship product, the da Vinci Surgical System, enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures with enhanced precision, control and dexterity. The system has been used in over 14.2 million surgeries across various specialties such as urology, gynecology, general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery. In its Q4 earnings report, Intuitive Surgical announced procedures had increased by 22% from last year with 2.3 million procedures performed in 2023.\n\nWall Street, overall, has remained upbeat about Intuitive Surgical, with the majority of analysts covering the stocks issuing a “Buy” or “Strong Buy” rating for the robotics firm’s stock. In fact, investment banks Stifel and Citigroup have raised their price targets to $430 and $462, respectively.\n\nISRG shares have appreciated nearly 16% on a year-to-date perspective.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2024, with shares of the chipmaker registering stunning gains of 70% so far this year as its artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled growth shows no signs of stopping.\n\nNvidia's revenue and earnings are topping Wall Street expectations. Even better, Nvidia is expected to sustain its impressive growth going forward thanks to its 90%-plus share of the AI chip market and an aggressive product roadmap. The company is set to launch even faster AI graphics cards that will allow its customers to train even bigger large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe stock's terrific surge also goes some way toward explaining why it is now trading at 74 times trailing earnings. That's substantially higher than the Nasdaq-100's trailing earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Still, there is a good chance that Nvidia will be able to justify its valuation thanks to the solid growth opportunities it is sitting on. The stock looks cheap when we consider the projected growth that it may deliver.\n\nEven then, value-oriented investors are likely to look for alternatives to Nvidia so that they can capitalize on the AI chip's market growth without having to pay an expensive valuation. This is where Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) comes in. Let's see why this chipmaker could turn out to be a solid Nvidia alternative for investors looking to benefit from the AI boom.\n\nBroadcom's AI-related revenue is growing at a faster-than-expected pace\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Feb. 4), Broadcom reported total revenue of $11.9 billion, an increase of 34% from the year-ago period. Excluding the revenue contribution from VMware, which Broadcom fully acquired in November 2023, the company's revenue increased 11% year over year on an organic basis.\n\nThat points toward an acceleration in Broadcom's growth, considering that it ended fiscal 2023 with organic revenue growth of 8%. AI played a key role in accelerating Broadcom's growth last quarter. The company sold $2.3 billion worth of AI chips in Q1 of fiscal 2024, a 4x increase over the prior-year period. Broadcom's AI revenue displayed a significant jump from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company now forecasts at least $10 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which would represent a quarter of its estimated revenue of $50 billion for the full year. Analysts were originally expecting Broadcom to end the year with $8 billion in AI-related revenue this year. However, the company seems to be benefiting from an increasingly strong demand for custom AI chips.\n\nMajor cloud computing companies are opting to make application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for powering their AI servers in a bid to reduce costs and boost efficiency. These companies are turning to Broadcom to make those custom chips. Meta Platforms and Alphabet are already its customers, and Broadcom recently revealed that it has won an additional customer for its custom AI processors.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, custom chips could make up for 30% of the overall AI chip market by 2027 and produce an estimated $55 billion in annual revenue. This explains why Japanese investment bank Mizuho is forecasting Broadcom's AI-related revenue to increase to $20 billion a year by 2027. That won't be surprising as, according to JPMorgan, Broadcom enjoys a 35% share of the high-end market for ASICs.\n\nHealthy bottom-line growth could send the stock higher\n\nBroadcom stock has jumped nearly 19% in 2024. However, investors who haven't bought the stock yet should consider doing so soon, as it seems built for more upside considering the potential earnings growth it could deliver. AVGO EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe chip stock is currently trading at 29 times forward earnings, which is lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30. Assuming Broadcom trades at 30 times earnings after three years and achieves $65.43 per share in earnings, as the chart indicates, its stock price could jump to $1,963. That would be a 48% increase from current levels.\n\nHowever, Broadcom could deliver even stronger gains, as its earnings could increase at a faster pace thanks to the growing demand for custom AI chips. That's why investors looking for an attractively valued AI stock that could deliver healthy appreciation should consider buying it before it jumps higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Intel's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Send It Soaring Past Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is known as the world's top seller of artificial intelligence (AI) chips because its product has been unbeatable so far. The company makes the most powerful chip out there today, helping companies power the tasks of training and inferencing for their AI models. This has helped Nvidia's earnings soar in the triple digits last year -- and its share price followed, with an increase of more than 200% over the past year.\n\nMeanwhile, rival Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) hasn't fared as well. Lower personal computer demand in recent times has weighed on revenue. On top of this, Intel fell behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race. All of this has left its shares trading at half their 2020 level.\n\nThe tide may be about to turn, though, as Intel ramps up its AI portfolio. Just this week, the company announced its new AI chip Gaudi 3. Can this new product send Intel soaring past Nvidia? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGaudi 3's performance\n\nLet's start with some details about this new Intel chip. The company says Gaudi 3 offers 4x more AI compute and a 1.5x increase in memory bandwidth, compared to its predecessor.\n\nImportantly, Intel's new chip may challenge Nvidia's top-performing graphics processing unit (GPU), the H100. The Gaudi 3 may deliver a 50% faster training time than the H100 when used on certain large language models (LLMs) -- for example, Llama 2.\n\nIts inference throughput could outperform the H100 by an average of 50%, and the product is more power-efficient than Nvidia's, too. Intel didn't offer a price range for the Gaudi 3 but said it delivers superior performance to the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost.\" The company plans to make Gaudi 3 available to companies that build platforms with these chips in the second quarter.\n\nDoes this mean Intel could be on the way to unseating Nvidia? Not necessarily.\n\nIt's important to remember that the Gaudi 3 performance levels are \"on average\" and using certain LLMs at specific parameters. And Nvidia isn't sitting still when it comes to product innovation. The company recently announced its new Blackwell architecture, and its most powerful chips ever, the B100, are set for release later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if Intel's Gaudi 3 outperforms the H100, it's very likely Nvidia will surge into the lead from a performance perspective when it releases the Blackwell platform. I don't see Gaudi 3 as a threat to demand for Nvidia's products or the company's long-term earnings prospects.\n\nAn important catalyst for Intel\n\nI do see the product as an important catalyst for Intel's earnings and share-price performance. Demand for AI chips is high and likely to keep on growing -- with the AI market forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. It's unlikely that just one company will serve all of this demand.\n\nHere's another point to keep in mind: Cost is a significant factor that comes into play for many companies as they launch AI programs, and some of them don't necessarily need the world's most powerful chip. This leaves plenty of room for a high-quality product offering great performance at a reasonable price to carve out a spot in the market.\n\nIntel probably won't soar past Nvidia to become the world's biggest AI chipmaker, but the Gaudi 3 could offer the company a much-needed boost to earnings. As more and more companies -- with a wide range of budgets and needs -- launch AI programs, opportunities will multiply for Intel and other companies producing high-performance chips. Intel's focus on performance at a lower cost could help it carve out a niche.\n\nAn Intel survey of 430 tech professionals showed that only about 10% of their organizations had sent generative AI models to production last year. This reinforces the idea that we're in the early days of the AI boom.\n\nAs for share performance, if Gaudi 3 and Intel's other new AI products take off, Intel stock could beat Nvidia when it comes to percentage gains. After declining 45% over the past three years, Intel is ripe for recovery. Trading for 27x forward earnings estimates means the stock is reasonably priced.\n\nWhile the Gaudi 3 launch isn't bad news for Nvidia, it's definitely great news for Intel and its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): More Cyclical Than You’d Think",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs semiconductors used in everything from AI to gaming to crypto mining. The company also owns Cuda, an AI training software. I’m bearish on Nvidia, which trades at 76x earnings and what are likely peak profit margins. I believe the company is more cyclical than most people think.\n\nNvidia, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicles, has enjoyed a first-mover advantage in AI. The problem is that, like Tesla in electric vehicles, the competition has increased exponentially, and the company is cyclical and vulnerable to a recession.\n\nA Terrific Company, But More Cyclical Than You Think\n\nNvidia is no doubt a revolutionary company. The AI language models that it helps power are changing the world. Search has become faster and easier than ever before, and AI will not stop there, with many more use cases on the horizon.\n\nHowever, much of this revolution is now baked into Nvidia’s financials, with net income having increased from $4.37 billion in year-end 2023 to $29.76 billion in year-end 2024. This is an enormous increase.\n\nNvidia and the AI revolution look comparable to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Internet revolution of the late 1990s. I recently checked Intel’s financials from 1993-2000, the period marked by the inception of the Internet. Intel’s net income increased at a much slower pace than Nvidia’s.\n\nIt took seven years for Intel’s net income to increase 360% vs. one year for Nvidia’s net income to increase 581%. During the recession of 2001, as the Internet bubble deflated, Intel’s net income collapsed 88% from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001.\n\nI suspect Nvidia’s profits will be no less cyclical than Intel’s. Yet, the market is pricing in an unending upward trend in the company’s earnings. The fact that Nvidia’s net income increased so fast means there’s less growth ahead, not more. If Nvidia’s customers suffer in a recession, which I believe they will, Nvidia will suffer too in terms of falling earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Nvidia’s annual report, the company outlined these risks, saying, “Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty.”\n\nCompetition Is Coming\n\nNvidia’s operating margin is at a record high of 54%, but if we look at the company’s history, its average operating margin is closer to just 20%. In a cyclical industry like chip designing, this is a red flag. It means earnings could fall more than 50% just to get back to the norm. In recessions, things can get even worse. Nvidia’s operating margin approached the low single digits in the recession of 2003 and went negative in 2009.\n\nThere are two reasons Nvidia’s margins could contract. One is the economic weakness we discussed earlier, which could affect Nvidia’s customers. Two is increasing competition, which is now coming from everywhere, including Nvidia’s own customers.\n\nThis risk was outlined in Nvidia’s annual report, which stated, “Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.”\n\nAll the semiconductor investment we’re seeing, spurred by AI hype and governmental support, is bad news for Nvidia. Big tech companies are spending billions on in-house solutions, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel are racing to catch up, and China is attempting to become semiconductor self-reliant.\n\nI hate industries that are seeing a lot of investment and increasing competition because that’s usually bad for future profit margins. Nvidia was developing AI solutions in a sleepy market for years, but that has all changed now. AI is the hottest market there is, and new competitors are spending R&D money hand over fist. For this reason, I cannot be sure who will have the technological edge in 10 years’ time. Just as Intel has, Nvidia could easily lose its edge over the years.\n\nNVDA Stock’s Valuation Is Extreme\n\nDespite having seen its net income and margins explode upwards, Nvidia is now trading at 76x earnings, 36x sales, and 51x book. Normally, you see the market pricing in that a company is nearing a cyclical peak when earnings surge 581% year-over-year by assigning lower multiples. However, this is certainly not the case for Nvidia.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, 39 out of 41 analysts covering NVDA give it a Buy rating, two rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average Nvidia stock price target is $989.53, implying upside potential of 9.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $620 per share to a high of $1,400 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on NVDA Stock\n\nI believe Nvidia is comparable to Intel near the peak of the dot-com bubble. Intel benefited from the Internet boom, with a dominant position in semiconductors used in PCs and technologies used for Wi-Fi. However, as competition increased, overinvestment ran rampant, and demand fell, Intel’s stock and earnings collapsed alongside those of other dot-com names.\n\nThe same could happen to Nvidia as semiconductor investment has surged in big tech land and China. With a 581% year-over-year increase in earnings, Nvidia’s profits could be nearing a peak. The next recession may mark the end as orders for Nvidia’s products can quickly be canceled due to an industry-specific downturn, wide-scale recession, or substitution for another company’s products.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "12 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our introduction of what counter cyclical stocks are and how they behave with respect to the economy and other macroeconomic indicators, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in.\n\nWhen we talk about dividing stocks based on their share price behavior in response to economic events and news, the two widely used categories are consumer cyclical and consumer defensive. As their titles suggest, consumer cyclical stocks are those that follow economic cycles. The latter, on the other hand, are also called counter cyclical stocks, and they are considered as a buffer against the broader stock market downturns that often take place if investors believe that the economy is in trouble.\n\nThis bifurcation of the stock market between cyclical and counter cyclical stocks is based on their underlying business models. Cyclical socks are typically present in high growth industries such as consumer technology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. This means that their business models and markets are dependent on factors such as consumer purchasing power, inflation, and interest rates. These three major economic indicators fluctuate with the economy, and when economic performance is robust and authorities are taking a proactive approach to managing monetary policy, then purchasing power is stable and inflation and interest rates are typically low.\n\nOn the flip side, in the case of poor economic performance, both businesses and consumers find it difficult to splurge on luxury items or pricey items such as artificial intelligence processors from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). These processors are believed to cost as much as a whopping $2 million a piece. Consequently, if a business is struggling during an economic downturn or capital is hard to raise due to high interest rates, then companies might be unwilling to buy these chips. As a result, NVIDIA becomes a cyclical stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile NVIDIA's consumer or enterprise products are typically considered a luxury, after all, few people need a GPU to just live, stocks such as the mega retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are counter cyclical stocks. To be clear, counter cyclical does not imply that if there is say a recession in America then Walmart's shares will rise. Instead, it means that in such a scenario, the stock will tend to lose a smaller portion of its value when compared to the high growth cyclical stocks that we've identified above.\n\nSo why do counter cyclical stocks tend to hold their ground when everybody else is running for cover? Well, the answer is relatively simple, and while Walmart is a good example for illustration, we've got an even better example of a counter cyclical stock to pickle your brain. This stock belongs to none other than one of the biggest tobacco companies in the world, the Stamford, Connecticut based counter cyclical giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). Phillip Morris sells cigarettes, a highly addictive combination of nicotine and the first type of anti depressants developed called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\n\nThis makes cigarette smokers vulnerable to an unending cycle of low dopamine and no dopamine, meaning that they simply have to buy and smoke the tobacco sticks no matter what state the economy is in. Consequently, the demand for cigarettes is unelastic not only to price but also to the smoker's economic condition, and investors, aware of this, pile into these stocks to protect their money in a weak economic environment.\n\nYet, just because counter cyclical stocks are portfolio buffers in a troubled economy doesn't mean they can't perform well when the economy is kicking. In fact, one counter cyclical stock that has held its ground this year has been Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) whose shares are up 42% year to date. Here's what Artisan Partners had to say about the stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nCelsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius' product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at hedge funds' favored counter cyclical, or consumer defensive stock picks. A handful of notable names are The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). 12 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best counter cyclical stocks, we ranked the forty most valuable counter cyclical stocks in terms of their market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares during Q4 2023.\n\nFor these top counter cyclical stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "Micron's DRAM Supply Temporarily Hit by Taiwan Earthquake, But Long-Term Outlook Remains Strong\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) announced that the April 3 earthquake in Taiwan will likely reduce its dynamic random access memory (DRAM) supply for the calendar quarter by up to a mid-single-digit percentage.\n\nWith operations in four Taiwanese locations, Micron plays a significant role in the global chip supply chain, sparking concerns about potential disruptions due to the earthquake.\n\nHowever, the company clarified that while it hasn’t reached full DRAM production capacity post-earthquake, the event will not affect its long-term DRAM supply capabilities, Reuters reports.\n\nThese chips, designed for use in Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 graphics processing units for AI applications, have seen tremendous market demand.\n\nThe booming AI industry’s demand for DRAM chips has led to a surge in Micron’s stock as investors recognize the company’s growing role in supplying the technology sector.\n\nIn response to the increasing demand, especially from the AI sector, Micron began mass production of its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips in February.\n\nA 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan on Wednesday at 8 a.m. local time, with Hualien in eastern Taiwan as its epicenter. This was the most severe earthquake to hit the region in 25 years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) quickly evacuated its factories, raising concerns about potential production impacts.\n\nHowever, TSMC reassured that its safety protocols were effective, reporting a swift recovery of over 80% in tool functionality at its facilities, including the advanced Fab 18 in Tainan, expecting full operational status by day’s end. Meanwhile, Nvidia communicated that, after consulting with its manufacturing partners, it foresees no disruptions to its supply chain due to the earthquake, as reported by Reuters.\n\nAnalysts flagged Micron’s HBM3E due to its outstanding thermal and power efficiency, highlighting its 30% reduced power consumption over SK Hynix and its technological edge over Samsung, which faced delays.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey predicted Micron would dominate the HBM market, potentially exceeding $1 billion in HBM revenues by the 2024 calendar year, positioning Micron as a significant player in the semiconductor sector.\n\nMicron stock surged over 96% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI) and Invesco Semiconductors ETF (NYSE:PSI).\n\nPrice Action: MU shares traded higher by 3.16% at $126.06 on the last check Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Micron\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Micron's DRAM Supply Temporarily Hit by Taiwan Earthquake, But Long-Term Outlook Remains Strong originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "All-Time High Flyers: 7 Stocks to Buy as the Market Peaks",
        "content": "If you’re wondering which stocks to buy in April, here’s a good place to start. The stock market is off to a difficult start in the second quarter. With the timing of interest rates getting pushed out further, the major averages have turned downwards. Since peaking on March 28, the benchmark S&P 500 index has declined nearly 2%. The dip has some on Wall Street wondering aloud if we’re at or close to the market’s peak and now entering what could be a steep selloff. Many analysts say a pullback is overdue with all three major stock indices hitting all-time highs throughout the first quarter.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained more than 25% from the end of October through the end of March, which is quite a strong rally. Stocks in certain sectors rallied particularly hard, notably artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, cybersecurity, and weight-loss medications. But much of the rally was predicated on expectations for lower interest rates, the timing of which has been thrown into doubt with inflation remaining high and the economy showing resilience. Here are all-time high flyers: seven stocks to buy as the market peaks.\n\nStocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to assert its dominance in AI and its stock has been responding. In the last 12 months, MSFT stock has increased nearly 50%, including a 15% increase this year. The company and its stock continue to be viewed as one of the best ways to play the bull market in AI that is helping to push the stock market to record highs. Recently, Microsoft further expanded its global reach in AI, announcing an investment of $2.90 billion to enhance its AI business in Japan.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe money, which represents Microsoft’s biggest ever investment in Japan, will go towards the development of advanced AI semiconductors at two facilities in the Asian nation. Microsoft also plans to allocate funds towards an AI reskilling program in Japan that will see three million workers trained on the technology. And, the company plans to establish a new AI lab in Tokyo for research and development on robotics and machine learning. This is just the latest example of how Microsoft is staying ahead in the AI race.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn addition to AI, another major catalyst for the market continues to be cryptocurrencies. And one of the best ways to play the boom in crypto is to own shares of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange have been white hot amid the rise in crypto prices. In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 277%. Already in 2024, the company’s share price has gained 60%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more upside ahead for Coinbase and its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) recently raised their price target on COIN stock to $276 from $200 and reiterated a “buy” rating on the shares. The price target is 11% higher than where Coinbase’s stock currently trades. In a research note, Oppenheimer said that Coinbase is likely to benefit from the long-term adoption of blockchain technology. The brokerage also raised its earning estimates for Coinbase.\n\nThe analyst upgrade comes as Coinbase announced that it has received regulatory approval to begin operating its cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has now become the biggest crypto trading platform north of the border.\n\nStocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nNo corner of the market is hotter right now than semiconductor stocks. Microchips and semiconductors are viewed as the key to unlocking the potential of AI, fueling a huge rally. And among chip and semi stocks, one of the best to own is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), commonly known as TSMC. The Taiwanese company currently manufacturers more than half (50%) of all the microchips in the world, with some estimates putting its market share as high as 60%.\n\nThe dominance of TSMC when it comes to making microchips and semiconductors for third parties such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has pushed its share price sharply higher. Through 12 months, TSM stock is up 62% and currently trading near its all-time high. The company and stock just got a boost from news that the U.S. government is giving it $6.60 billion to help fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona.\n\nThe government funding is coming from the U.S. CHIPS Act that aims to increase America’s chip security and lessen the country’s reliance on foreign made microchips and semiconductors. TSMC is spending about $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix, Arizona. In announcing the funding, the U.S. government said that TSMC’s Arizona plants have already created more than 25,000 jobs and attracted 14 semiconductor suppliers to the southwestern state.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow that General Electric has successfully divided itself into three publicly traded companies, it might be an opportune time to invest in GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), which retains the company’s original industrial business, including its aircraft engine manufacturing unit. Not only has GE stock doubled in the past 12 months as the company hived itself into three, but GE Aerospace just announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by an astounding 250%.\n\nGoing forward, GE Aerospace will pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share, up from eight cents previously. Last fall, management outlined plans to return 75% of the company’s free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks once the dust settled on the three-way split. GE Aerospace has said that it expects to generate more than $5 billion of free cash flow this year, which could lead to windfall for current and future shareholders. This makes GE Aerospace a stock to buy as the market peaks.\n\nStocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a buy-the-dip candidate. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has seen its stock decline 5% so far in 2024. Through 12 months, the company’s share price is down 7%. Now might be the time to buy JNJ stock as the company continues to grow through an acquisition strategy. Johnson & Johnson has just announced that it is buying Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ:SWAV) for $13.10 billion as it grows its treatments for heart disease and other pulmonary ailments.\n\nThe purchase of Shockwave Medical is the largest by Johnson & Johnson since its $16.60 billion acquisition of heart pump maker Abiomed in 2022. Shockwave Medical specializes in medical devices that use shockwaves to break down calcified plaque in heart vessels. It’s a process that is similar to how kidney stones are broken apart and removed. Under terms of the deal, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $335 per share in cash to acquire Shockwave Medical. The acquisition is expected to close this summer.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nAnother stock that looks like a deal at current levels is United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The company’s stock is also down 5% this year and looks cheap right now trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend that yields 4.34%. Like the other names on this list, goods things are happening at United Parcel Service with catalysts that are likely to send UPS stock higher in the coming months.\n\nSpecifically, United Parcel Service has just struck a deal to become the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service, replacing archrival Federal Express (NYSE:FDX). FedEx previously had the air cargo contract with the U.S. Postal Service for 22 years and earned $1.73 billion from it in 2023. The contract with the U.S. Postal Service now switches to United Parcel Service in September of this year and will give its earnings a boost going forward. UPS stock has declined 21% over the last year.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn healthcare, nothing is working right now quite as well as weight-loss drugs. And Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is leading in this area with its in-demand medications Ozempic and Wegovy. Sales of the weight-loss drugs are rising fast, sending NVO stock higher as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s share price has gained 57%, including a 22% increase so far in 2024. The growth has made Novo Nordisk one of Europe’s largest publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of nearly half a trillion dollars.\n\nEven with the growth from the weight-loss drugs, the Danish pharmaceutical giant isn’t sitting idle. Novo Nordisk has announced that it is buying privately held Cardior Pharmaceuticals for $1.10 billion. The acquisition strengthens Novo Nordisk’s pipeline of cardiovascular medications. The company has said that it is expanding its diabetes and weight-loss drugs to also include cardiovascular and heart treatments.\n\nThe acquisition includes Cardior Pharmaceuticals’ lead compound CDR132L that is in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. The purchase of Cardior is expected to close in the current second quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

The CMA said it wanted to learn from the past in digital markets where a winner-takes-all dynamic led to the rise of a small number of all-powerful platforms.\n\n“When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive officer of the CMA, said.\n\nThe CMA’s remarks reflect concerns around how the biggest US tech companies have potential concern is how the biggest US tech companies have acquired stakes in many of the most promising AI startups, deals that involve both funding and strategic access to infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft is OpenAI’s biggest backer, has invested in French AI startup Mistral and recently hired most of the team from Inflection AI. Google, owner of the AI lab DeepMind, has invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, as has Amazon. Chipmaker Nvidia has backed dozens of startups, including large language model startup Cohere.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch deals may attract less regulatory scrutiny than full acquisitions, though the EU is probing Microsoft over the nature of its relationship to OpenAI and Mistral. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s antitrust chief also said Thursday that AI is going to change the marketplace and regulators need to be vigilant.\n\n“We see a lot of entrenched market power when it comes to technology,” Vestager said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “It’s really important that now when we have technology, which is not just a new technology but is basically a new world that we’re looking into, that we make sure it’s a competitive new world.”\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission also launched inquiries into Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft’s AI partners. The CMA also has a separate initial investigation into Microsoft’s OpenAI investment.\n\nRead More: Big Tech’s Year of Partnering Up With AI Startups\n\nThe CMA will be assessing the market over the coming months and may use existing merger and investigations reviews to intervene. It is also considering whether to include this behavior in its new powers under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that will come into force this summer.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Meta didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Katharine Gemmell, Katie Greifeld and Annmarie Hordern.\n\n(Updates with EU’s Margrethe Vestager)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, the Amazon chief said the technology is the company’s next major product opportunity, up there with Marketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nJassy also laid out why Amazon is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of generative AI, explaining how the company has all of the pieces in place to be the go-to tech firm for both enterprise customers’ and consumers’ generative AI needs.\n\n“The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all,” Jassy wrote in his letter. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.”\n\nAmazon has kept a relatively low profile when it comes to generative AI compared to the likes Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which have spent the last year boasting about their AI offerings and debuting new generative AI-powered products and services.\n\nBut Amazon has been investing heavily in the technology, including pouring $4 billion into AI startup Anthropic, which has become a kind of flagship offering for the company akin to how Microsoft positions its relationship with OpenAI.

Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nNow, Jassy seems ready to push Amazon as a major generative AI player like its rivals. That includes laying out the company’s approach to the technology from the chips used to train and run AI models to apps like its Rufus chatbot for Amazon’s Marketplace and Amazon Q, which writes and debugs code for AWS users.\n\nIn his letter, Jassy touted Amazon’s investments in its Graviton CPU chips, as well as its Trainium chip for training AI models and Inferentia chip for inferencing those models, as key offerings that set Amazon apart from the competition. Inferencing refers to using AI models to complete tasks.\n\nAnd while Jassy said that Amazon offers a vast array of Nvidia (NVDA) chips to its customers for training and deploying AI models, he positioned Amazon’s chips as viable alternatives that can meet customers’ needs at a time when Nvidia’s chips are in short supply and the price to run AI models soars.\n\nStory continues\n\nJassy also appeared to take a shot at his Big Tech rivals when it comes to the AI models themselves, saying that Amazon offers models from a slew of companies including Anthropic, Stability AI, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, and Amazon’s own models, rather than just one major AI model. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“Customers don’t want only one model,” Jassy said. “They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications.”\n\nWhile Microsoft and Google offer multiple AI models to their enterprise customers, the companies have spent much of their time hyping their respective AI platforms. Microsoft regularly points to its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI as a major factor that differentiates it from other Big Tech firms, while Google is focused on rolling out and hyping its Gemini foundation models.\n\nJassy also pointed to Amazon’s efforts to build its own generative AI apps including its Amazon Q platform for AWS developers and Rufus chatbot. I used an early version of Rufus, and while I found it helpful in some respects, it’s also still prone to errors when answering some queries.\n\nNow that Amazon is going full force into the generative AI realm, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft and Google respond. We’ll find out more when both companies host their respective developer conferences next month.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "7 Non-Pharma Penny Stocks on the Brink of 100% Gains",
        "content": "Penny stocks and pharmaceutical stocks are highly interrelated. Both asset classes are speculative in nature and many of the highest potential penny stocks tend to exist in the pharma sector. The reason is simple: returns for successfully developing a therapeutic drug or medical device are very high but the chances of failure are also very high. It’s also very easy to find pharma penny stocks that can double. It’s more difficult to identify non-pharma penny stocks that can double.\n\nYet, that is the focus of this article. We will be discussing shares of non-pharma penny stocks priced below $10 with the potential to double.\n\nPer usual, only invest in penny stocks what you could comfortably lose. While they have the potential to produce outsized returns they’re also notorious for producing losses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven non-pharma penny stocks for investors to consider buying.\n\nVinFast Auto (VFS) EvCard charging station. EvCard is China's first electric vehicle rental service. As of July 2017, it had around 6,000 cars and 3,000 stations in Shanghai. Chinese EV stocks\n\nSource: abolukbas / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is one of the lesser-discussed EV stocks but one worth considering for its potential and unique story. The company is the first Vietnamese automobile manufacturing company.\n\nThat’s important because domestic automobile manufacturing is an important step in bringing a given country to the world stage. That’s what makes VinFast an interesting story. Vietnam is quickly rising to the world stage as it becomes part of a China de-risking strategy in relation to supply chains.\n\nThe company is working to establish itself as the EV manufacturer of choice in the fast-growing southeast Asia region. The company is also expanding its network into the Philippines at present with a plan to expand to more than 50 countries this year. It’s one of those non-pharma penny stocks.\n\nSales and deliveries are growing quickly but did come in below guidance. It is expected that the stock will more than double and perhaps triple as the sector rebounds. such a performance will be predicated upon better deliveries figures moving forward.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding mobile phone with web page of US eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. Archer Aviation Stock Analysis\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NASDAQ:ACHR) Continues to make strides and is likely to become one of the top, if not the top, flying car firm. Thus, its stock is one to watch and one that is expected by many to double in price.The company continues to head toward FAA certification and a commercial launch in 2025.\n\nThe company is also expected to complete a high-volume manufacturing facility this year. It is expected that the company will produce 650 Vehicles annually beginning in 2025. Meanwhile, Archer Aviation boasts an order book valued at $3.5 billion dollars. It includes orders for 700 of its eVTOL vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company simply has to continue its test flights in order to certify those vehicles. Then it has to fulfill those orders. Flying cars are going to represent  a burgeoning growth opportunity in the coming years and will play an important part in commercial aviation among other sectors.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it. favorite Lithium stocks\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock continues to flourish after a long period of skepticism connected to the decline in lithium prices. It’s been about two months since LAC shares fell below $4. They’ve rebounded from that bottom rising above $7 as I write this article.\n\nThere are likely a few reasons for that strong rebound to have occurred. One of the most important is the fact that Lithium Americas received a $2.26 billion dollar loan from the Department of Energy for the construction of its Thacker Pass site. However, that happened one month ago and thus cannot fully explain the run-up in price over the past two months.\n\nMy guess is that investors are simply coming to the realization that the long-term growth of the EV industry implies a rebound in lithium prices over the midterm. lithium Americas is expected to begin production within that time frame. Yes, it is an upstart but it is not at risk of failure given its funding. This makes it one of those non-pharma penny stocks to consider.\n\nEnovix (ENVX) Energy Storage. battery stocks\n\nEnovix (NASDAQ:ENVX) Is another firm with connections to the EV sector. The stock represents a lithium battery producer that is rapidly improving its fundamental business. it deserves a look from investors seeking non-pharma penny stocks that are set to double.\n\nThe company is currently in growth mode. That truth is evidenced by its most recent earnings report. It shows that the company’s revenues increased from $1.1 million during the 4th quarter of 2022 to $7.4 million a year later. A lot of that growth was attributable to its acquisition of Routejade  in late 2023 as well as a strong business with The U.S. Army.\n\nInvestors should expect the company to continue to expand. The company built out 250,000 ft of its high capacity manufacturing plant in Malaysia.The company is expected to produce its first battery samples from that plant this month. Shares currently trade for between $7 and $8 a piece. Some estimates expect that those shares could rise to $36 in value over the coming year and a half.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nPlanet Labs (NYSE:PL) benefits from multiple opportunities in the coming years. It is a company and stock that is positioned to grow as the space race heats up. The company is wholly focused on satellite imagery.\n\nIt wouldn’t be fair to describe the company as stable but there are some things to truly appreciate about it. Planet Labs operates without debt. That means the company has a distinct advantage in this high rate environment. However, Planet Labs is burning through cash at a fairly rapid rate. in time that could necessitate additional moves that could include debt financing. For now, that isn’t the case.\n\nThe company also benefits from a strong relationship with the defense sector and recently secured a contract with the U.S. Navy. The company will assist with monitoring throughout the Pacific ocean. There is an obvious and continuing opportunity there in relation to the ongoing rivalry between the U.S. and China. That is part of the bigger narrative that supports an investment in Planet Labs.\n\nLanzaTech Global (LNZA) A concept image of a penny sitting on a stock chart\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLanzaTech Global (NASDAQ:LNZA) is a company that turns waste carbon into the basic materials used in consumer goods such as sustainable fuels, fabrics, and packaging. Shares currently trade for $3 and are expected to rise to $7 per consensus opinion.\n\nThe company has been selected by the department of energy to receive $200 million dollars in funding. LanzaTech Global was selected by the DoE along with Technip Energies to receive that award in connection to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).The two companies will collaborate to produce sustainable ethylene from captured carbon dioxide. The value of that market is expected to approach $200 billion by 2030.\n\nFourth quarter revenues reached $20.5 million, an increase of 77% on a year over year basis.During 2023 overall revenues increased from $37.34 million to $62.63 million. At the same time, LanzaTech Global is not without risk. Net losses increased by approximately 90% during the same period. This makes it one of those non-pharma penny stocks.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is the must know stock name for investors concerned with AI voice. It’s been a bumpy ride for shares following the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) filing showing that the firm owned 1.7 million shares of SOUN stock. Prices approached $9 after that revelation and have since fallen back toward $5.\n\nSoundHound AI’s connection to Nvidia is deeper than a position alone. SoundHound AI utilizes Nvidia’s Drive platform for specific in-car voice applications. Nvidia and SoundHound AI are aligned in order to create novel applications.\n\nSoundHound AI is also growing very rapidly. Q4 revenues grew by 80%, reaching $17.1 million.\n\nThe stock represents one of the best-known names in the AI voice sector. That’s a sector that some believe is the next natural step for generative AI.\n\nThe company has a strong position the AI voice restaurant sector. SoundHound AI purchased SYNQ3 which had 10,000 partnerships and 100,000 restaurants in its pipeline at that time. That acquisition strengthens an already strong position in conversational AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Fantastic Growth Stocks That Have Turned $10,000 Into $3 Million in 20 Years",
        "content": "Investing in top growth stocks can not only make you a millionaire, but a multimillionaire. And in some cases, you can achieve those kinds of results by investing just $10,000. Three examples of fantastic long-term investments over the past 20 years are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). These stocks have turned $10,000 investments into more than $3 million today. Here's how they've done it, and whether they are still good stocks to own today.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nChipmaker Nvidia has taken off in value over the past few years as investors have grown excited about the company's long-term prospects in artificial intelligence (AI). Whether it's creating chatbots or new AI models, Nvidia has become synonymous with AI investing. Many top tech companies have partnered with it as there's no shortage of customers eager to buy Nvidia's chips.\n\nTwo decades ago, this was still a big name in the computing world, and if you had invested $10,000 in the stock in April 2004, your investment would top $4 million right now. That's an amazing return, but it's hard, if not impossible, to predict winners like this.\n\nWhile you would be unlikely to generate returns like that from Nvidia if you bought the stock today, it can still be an excellent investment, nonetheless. In the trailing 12 months, the company has accumulated $30 billion in profits on revenues of $61 billion for an impressive profit margin of just under 50%.\n\nThe stock's relatively low price/earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG, of 1.2 also implies that analysts still see a lot more growth from the business down the road, and that the market may not be necessarily overvaluing the stock currently. If you're bullish on AI, it's hard to go wrong with Nvidia, even if you're buying the stock today.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple, the popular iPhone and iPad maker, has enjoyed a long and illustrious growth trajectory over the years. The business has evolved, and today has created a whole ecosystem that revolves around its products and related services. That can make acquiring a user particularly powerful, since the prospect of switching to an Android phone can be both costly and cumbersome.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough this year hasn't been a particularly strong one for Apple with its shares down 12% thus far in 2024, it has still been an exceptional stock to have owned over the long term. If you invested $10,000 into the stock 20 years ago, your investment would be worth approximately $3.5 million today, and about $4.1 million with dividends reinvested.\n\nApple is another example of a high-margin business as over the past four quarters, its net income has totaled $100.9 billion, which is 26% of its top line during that stretch ($385.7 billion). Now that the stock is taking a bit of a breather, investors may want to consider loading up on Apple's stock as it trades at 26 times earnings, which may not prove to be all that high for a business that still has a top brand and plenty of room to grow its revenue, particularly on the service side of things.\n\n3. Monster Beverage\n\nEnergy drink company Monster Beverage has built up a strong brand for decades. The company has been growing globally, and today it's a top beverage brand. It has partnered with the Ultimate Fighting Championship as key deals like that have helped Monster's brand become synonymous with high performance and athleticism.\n\nThe business is much smaller than the others on this list, generating revenue of just over $7.1 billion last year. But with strong profits of $1.6 billion, its profit margins have also been high at around 23%.\n\nOne thing that hasn't been modest has been the profit long-term investors would have accumulated from owning the stock. Like with Apple, a $10,000 investment in Monster's stock 20 years ago would have grown to a value of nearly $3.5 million today.\n\nAt 35.2 times its trailing earnings, however, the stock may be getting a bit pricey as its sales rose by just 13% last year, though earnings per share (EPS) rose by 38%, somewhat justifying the market's expectations. While Monster has historically been a good buy over the years, its future gains may be a bit more muted compared with the other stocks on this list. Monster can still make for a good investment, but investors should be careful not to expect sky-high returns just because of its past performance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Decades of Consistent Returns",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are finally cycling back into portfolios after a few years’ worth of higher interest rates put fixed-income options ahead of dividend distribution yield for income investors. As those investors circle back toward dividend stocks, a few things have changed about how to best look at the many available offerings – but that’s true for most stock segments today.\n\nFor example, today’s growth-minded investors demand stronger financial and fundamental credentials compared to the ZIRP era, when any company forecasting significant future profits could easily attract investor funds. That sentiment generally held no matter the company’s underlying financial management (or lack thereof). Investors now exercise more caution, shying away from speculative stocks with a more discerning eye.\n\nThis change also applies to dividend stocks, though in a somewhat opposite manner. While seeking greater stability in growth stocks, investors expect long-term growth potential from their value investments. Although short-term Treasuries still offer a yield of over 5%, income-producing stocks need to provide either a higher yield, the prospect of long-term capital gains, – or both – if they want to stand out from the pack.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nWe may be rounding the corner on tax season, but H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is now a top dividend stock to buy year-round. Breaking free from tax software’s inherently cyclical nature, H&R Block is increasingly looking to diversify revenue streams to keep cash coming in no matter the month.\n\nTo counter the tax sector’s seasonal nature, H&R Block launched a mobile banking service, which saw quick success and continued growth momentum. H&R Block’s latest report reveals over $456 million in net customer deposits and a total of 316,000 customer signups. Additionally, H&R Block is keen on leveraging new technologies for more efficient tax filing, working on an AI-powered tax assistance product alongside industry-heavyweight Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe appeal of H&R Block as a must-buy dividend stock is further solidified by its impressive total yield of 11.5%. This substantial yield, backed by a modest 33% payout ratio, indicates that H&R Block retains a considerable portion of its earnings for growth initiatives while still providing significant rewards to its shareholders.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently tops lists of dividend stocks to buy now, and for good reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty’s Dividend Aristocrat status, monthly distributions, and Treasury Bill-beating 5.65% yield make it a favorite among income and dividend investors. Despite its 7% dip since January and 13% loss over the past year, Realty Income’s fundamental strength remains solid, offering an excellent opportunity for long-term investors focused on wealth accumulation.\n\nThe company boasts a high occupancy rate exceeding 98% across its portfolio, with 80% of its retail tenants operating within recession-resilient industries. Realty Income’s triple-net lease model transfers all operational risks and costs, including property maintenance expenses, to its tenants, shielding the company from rising materials and labor costs. Additionally, it enjoys the stability of long-term leases, with an average length exceeding 15 years and an active average lease duration sitting close to ten years.\n\nBeyond its core focus, Realty Income is pursuing growth opportunities, notably through a recent sale-leaseback deal with the French company Decathlon SE. This strategy, combined with Realty Income’s growth potential, relatively low share price, and status as a dividend aristocrat, positions the dividend stock as a top pick in today’s market.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Realty Income, AT&T (NYSE:T) remains a must-buy dividend stock, even after losing its Dividend Aristocrat status in 2022. AT&T distinguishes itself with a forward-thinking approach and continues to innovate as it matures in the market.\n\nOne growth initiative is AT&T’s substantial investment in AST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) plan to launch satellite-based cellular services, targeting a commercial launch later in 2024. While not immediately transformative for AT&T, this venture demonstrates the company’s readiness to explore new growth avenues and stay competitive in a crowded market.\n\nAT&T’s late January earnings release revealed some missed targets but highlighted strong growth areas, including nearly 4% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenue. This growth signifies AT&T’s success in overcoming economic hurdles to maintain and expand its customer base with strategic pricing. Notably, AT&T added 526,000 postpaid phone subscribers, surpassing the expected 487,500, showcasing its competitive edge in a tough market.\n\nDespite criticisms of being a yield trap, AT&T upholds a 6.73% dividend yield with a manageable 56% payout ratio, making it an appealing choice for investors focused on dividends.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s tough to beat Warren Buffett when it comes to value investing, and one dividend stock he currently loves is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). With an 18% payout ratio delivering a 3.85% total yield, the stock offers considerable benefits for both income and growth-focused investors.\n\nBuffett significantly increased his investment in OXY throughout the past few years, especially in 2023, eventually securing a 27% ownership in the oil and gas company valued at over $14.5 billion. He also holds warrants that could increase his stake to 33%. And, though Occidental Petroleum has a range of net-zero and sustainability-focused initiatives, it still stands to benefit from higher crude oil pricing that’s currently creeping into markets.\n\nOver the past few months, OXY’s share price usually fluctuated between $55 and $65. But, partially on its own merits and partially due to crude price surges, Occidental Petroleum shares are closing in on new 5-year highs. It isn’t too late to ride Buffett’s coattails on this dividend stock pick, though, as it remains a unique growth play within a mature industry.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRecent telecom turbulence tested many established companies, including dividend aristocrat Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Despite this, Verizon showcases significant long-term potential for investors seeking reliable dividend stocks for long-term holding.\n\nThe primary cause of the stock’s suppression was last summer’s lead shielding scandal, which ultimately impacted telecom companies’ financial performance less than initially feared. However, Verizon’s shares have yet to rebound fully. The stock has remained relatively stagnant over the last year, with a mere 3.8% return, starkly contrasting to the S&P 500’s 21% gain during the same timeframe.\n\nVerizon’s latest earnings report reflects continuous growth, promising capital gains alongside dividend income for investors. The company reported a remarkable increase of 16.9% in postpaid phone additions in the most recent quarter compared to the previous year, marking its strongest performance in four years. Such significant expansion in the mature telecom industry suggests Verizon is effectively capturing market share from competitors and optimizing its marketing strategy.\n\nWith a current yield of just under 6.5%, some may view Verizon as a value trap for similar reasons to AT&T. But the company’s per-share pricing dips, coupled with promising growth indicators, position it as a prime choice among dividend stocks for long-term investment.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Walmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT), the global leader in supermarket and general merchandise retail, ranks as a must-consider option among undervalued dividend stocks due to its widespread popularity and resilience in economic downturns.\n\nOperating over 11,500 stores across 27 countries, Walmart boasts strategic proximity to 90% of the U.S. population within 10 miles, establishing itself as a primary choice for consumers seeking budget-friendly options.\n\nThe appeal of Walmart as a dividend stock stems from its longstanding distribution track record. Since initiating dividends in March 1974 at 5 cents per share, the company now offers a 1.88% total yield, demonstrating an average annual growth rate of 8% across the last five decades, a testament to its performance through various economic cycles.\n\nWalmart’s ability to secure favorable prices from suppliers due to its large scale and pass these savings onto customers underpins its success. Despite the challenge posed by Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) dominance in the online marketplace, Walmart has emerged as a formidable eComm competitor. This sales stream will likely keep growing in popularity, particularly as we start edging toward summer sales season again.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe medical stock sector experienced dramatic fluctuations during and after the pandemic. Understandably, investors became wary of the significant surges and declines in company stocks, casting a shadow over the industry. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a leading MedTech stock, saw its market cap fall by nearly a third post-pandemic. However, recent indicators suggest a robust recovery, and its 3.5% yield continues to satisfy investors during the wait for a rebound. At the same time, investors can rest easy with Medtronic’s dividend program, as it consistently raised its annual dividend for nearly 50 years.\n\nBut, in the medical device industry, Medtronic’s impact goes beyond the financial. The company is celebrated for its innovation and advancements in medical technology and is now shifting towards more collaborative and risk-based contracts with hospital networks. These agreements aim to improve patient outcomes and lower expenses, positioning Medtronic as a crucial ally in a time when healthcare delivery costs are rising. Concurrently, ongoing collaborations with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) position Medtronic at the cutting edge of health technology trends, solidifying its status as a long-term dividend stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "If you think about it, many of today’s high-flying stocks were once ignored by the Street. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a struggling video-game chip maker, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was a fledgling online book seller and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a formerly successful PC maker, fighting to stay in business. Indeed, the Street tends to shun stocks with great potential that are not yet delivering huge revenue gains or impressive partnerships. Therefore, it’s certainly worthwhile for long-term investors to consider buying stocks that are largely being shunned by the most popular business-news pundits and the largest investors. Here are three such overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nEisai (ESAIY) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Street is still not enthusiastic about Japanese drug maker Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESAIY), co-owner of the first-ever Alzheimer’s treatment, Leqembi, that has shown a significant amount of effectiveness.\n\nAccording to data reported late last year, 60% of a small group of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients who received the drug meaningfully improved. Among a larger group of patients with varied stages of the disease, cognitive decline was slowed by 27%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor a variety of logistics-related reasons, the uptake of the drug has been slower than expected. Neurologists have been unenthusiastic about the treatment. Insurers’ reluctance and IV-only delivery likely explains physicians’ reticence.\n\nThankfully, Eisai has begun seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous version of Leqembi which should ease the drug’s administration. Additionally, Eisai’s U.S. partner, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), is reportedly working to increase insurance coverage of the treatment.\n\nIn spite of the problems, Eisai predicts that the drug will generate almost $2 billion in sales by fiscal year 2027 and $8 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2031.\n\nEntain (GMVHY) sports betting stocks man celebrating winning bet on match, bookmaker app\n\nSource: Motortion Films / Shutterstock.com\n\nEntain (OTCMKTS:GMVHY), a UK-based online betting giant, delivered strong financial results in 2023. It also may greatly benefit from selling a stake in a joint venture to MGM (NYSE:MGM) and could itself become a takeover target.\n\nLast year, Entain’s revenue climbed 11% to 4.77 billion British pounds, while its operating profit, excluding certain items, jumped 18% to 641.8 million British pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Entain and MGM’s joint venture, BetMGM, rose 36% last year, and the joint venture generated positive EBITDA in the second half of the year. BetMGM’s revenue and EBITDA are likely to climb tremendously as the platform expands to more states and as the popularity of online betting spreads in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have been rumors that MGM would look to buy Entain’s stake in BetMGM. If that does occur, Entain would likely have several billion dollars of cash that it could return to shareholders or use to acquire a profitable firm.\n\nFurther, the London Times recently reported that private equity firms are interested in buying Entain. If that occurs, of course, the company’s shares would soar.\n\nAll of Entain’s positive catalysts make it one of the best overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nStem (STEM) Conceptual background of artificial intelligence, humans and cyber-business on programming technology element, 3D illustration. Next trillion-dollar companies. top AI stocks billionaires buy\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nStem’s (NYSE:STEM) AI-powered software maximizes the efficiency of electricity use. The electrification of transportation and the rapid proliferation of AI should cause Stem’s software demand to surge going forward.\n\nStem recently launched PowerBidder Pro to help energy traders and asset owners optimize their asset bids and manage risk. It also enables them, using AI, to predict their energy usage. The product appears to be geared to the owners of energy storage batteries, a sector that’s rapidly growing in America.\n\nEncouragingly, Stem already obtained a major customer and leading independent energy and commodity group,Mercuria, for PowerBidder Pro. Mercuria’s decision to purchase the product so soon after its launch bodes well for its outlook.\n\nStem expects to generate $50 million of cash this year, making it a prime choice among overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in STEM, ESAIY and MGM.

        "title": "Yikes! Don’t Get Trapped as Super Micro Computer Stock Rolls Over.",
        "content": "Some traders are buying Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock because the company sells artificial intelligence enabled servers. They’re looking for the “next” Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It’s a dangerous quest, though, and this is the worst possible time to invest Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nTruly, this is a recipe for disaster. As we’ll discover, the sentiment and expectations surrounding SMCI are sky high. Chasers get punished eventually, and with Super Micro Computer, I believe the reckoning will be sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Dizzying Ascent of SMCI Stock\n\nWhy did SMCI stock zoom from $100 to around $1,200 during the past year? And, just as importantly, why is the stock apparently starting to roll over?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe most obvious answer is that, as I alluded to earlier, AI-hardware hype is in full effect and everybody wants the “next” Nvidia stock. That’s not the only contributing factor, though.\n\nCurrently, Super Micro Computer is “double-dipping” as it’s a member of both the S&P 500and theRussell 2000. Thus, when funds and individual investors buy these indexes, they’re indirectly propping up SMCI stock.\n\nOne might whether Super Micro Computer can continue to be a member of a large-cap index and a small-cap index for much longer. Investors may also ask if Super Micro Computer’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.93x is sustainable.\n\nA Bad Sign for Super Micro Computer\n\nNow, after the wild share-price ascent, Super Micro Computer has to live up to high expectations. For example, JPMorgan analysts set a $1,150 price target on Super Micro Computer stock, while Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi envisions the stock rallying to $1,300.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer lifted its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance from a range of $10 billion to $11 billion, to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. That’s a big revenue-guidance hike, and it appears that the market has already priced its lofty expectations into the shares.\n\nYet, there’s a development that prospective investors can’t afford to ignore. Specifically, Super Micro Computer announced its plan to sell 2 million shares of the company at $875 apiece.\n\nThe news release for that announcement is dated March 19. On that day, Super Micro Computer stock traded at around $900; just a few days earlier, it traded at nearly $1,200. Thus, the company was evidently prepared to sell its shares at a discount.\n\nIt’s not a positive sign that Super Micro Computer is willing to sell millions of shares to the public to raise capital. This raises some questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow desperate is Super Micro Computer for capital? And, will the company resort to share-value-dilutive capital-raising measures in the future?\n\nSuper Micro Computer Stock Isn’t a Confident Investment\n\nSuper Micro Computer benefited from AI-hardware hype, “next” Nvidia fantasies and “double-dipping” in two major stock indexes. Now, with Super Micro Computer at a very high valuation, SMCI stock looks like it’s rolling over.\n\nOn top of all that, investors should be concerned about Super Micro Computer’s large-scale share sale.\n\nIn the final analysis, the risk-to-reward balance is unfavorable for Super Micro Computer stock. This is a great time to take profits on the stock, or if you’re not invested, just avoid it altogether.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Bill Ackman Owns $1.9 Billion Worth of This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably the world's most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stock, as evidenced by its 215% gain in the past year alone. It's not a claim without merit, because the company's revenue more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 28) on the back of its industry-leading AI data center chips.\n\nBut if investors want to know where the AI industry is headed next, it can be helpful to know where billionaires are putting their money. Bill Ackman, for example, manages a $10 billion stock portfolio for his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, and he doesn't own Nvidia at all.\n\nInstead, Ackman owns a $1.9 billion position in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Not only has he made solid gains on that investment already, but the stock is also still cheap and could be poised for further upside thanks to the company's AI initiatives.\n\nHere's why it's not too late for investors to follow Ackman's lead. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nMicrosoft created an opportunity for Ackman to buy Alphabet\n\nIt's no coincidence Bill Ackman bought Alphabet stock in the first quarter of 2023 when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced its $10 billion investment in leading AI startup OpenAI. Microsoft quickly integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its Bing search engine, in an attempt to disrupt Google's 91% market share in the internet search industry.\n\nTraditional search engines like Google typically make the user sift through web pages for the information they need, whereas Bing's new chatbot interface can instantly provide a direct answer to almost any question. It's a far more convenient experience. Alphabet stock plunged because investors feared the company fell way behind Microsoft on the AI front, but Ackman viewed that as a buying opportunity.\n\nIn a recent interview with David Rubenstein, Ackman said Alphabet's valuation had fallen so much that he was getting a great deal on the company's existing businesses, like search and YouTube, while getting its AI initiatives basically for free.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's interesting to note that Ackman felt Alphabet's AI technology was neck-and-neck with OpenAI's when he made the investment, even though Alphabet hadn't launched its own AI chatbot yet.\n\nAlphabet's Gemini now outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models\n\nShortly after Microsoft announced its OpenAI investment, Alphabet reminded investors it had been working on AI for years. After all, Google acquired AI startup DeepMind way back in 2014. That's why it took only a few months to launch Google Bard, a chatbot designed to compete directly with ChatGPT.\n\nThe quality of a generative AI application comes down to the quality of the developer's data, and since Google has been the window to the internet for decades, it arguably has more useful information with which to build AI applications than any other company.\n\nBard paved the way for Alphabet's latest and greatest family of AI models called Gemini, which were launched in December. According to Alphabet, Gemini outperforms OpenAI's most advanced GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, it's capable of interpreting and generating text content, images, videos, and computer code more accurately.\n\nAlphabet announced the release of Gemini 1.5, which is even more advanced, in February. The company says it's far better at \"in-context learning,\" meaning it can learn new skills from users' prompts without needing additional fine-tuning from developers. In one test, Alphabet gave Gemini 1.5 a grammar manual for a rare language called Kalamang -- which has fewer than 200 speakers worldwide -- and it could translate it at a similar level to human subjects who used the same learning material.\n\nGemini is now available as a standalone chatbot, but its technology is also woven into the traditional Google Search engine to feed users text-based responses in their search results. That reduces the amount of time users have to spend clicking through to third-party web pages for the information they need, striking a balance between traditional search and the chatbot experience.\n\nAckman is sitting on big gains, but Alphabet stock can still go higher\n\nAckman bought the bulk of Pershing Square's Alphabet position in the first quarter of 2023, at an estimated average price of $96.56. That implies he's sitting on a 60% gain based on the stock's current price of $154.85. Ackman added to his holdings in the second and third quarters of 2023, and he's sitting on a profit on those positions, too. But it isn't too late for investors to follow his lead, because the stock is still relatively cheap.\n\nAlphabet generated a record $307.4 billion in revenue in 2023, with $5.80 in earnings per share (that is, profit). The latter places Alphabet stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7. That means Alphabet is the second-cheapest stock among the six U.S. tech giants valued at $1 trillion or more: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe advertising dollars generated by Google Search still account for most of Alphabet's revenue. However, Google Cloud is the company's fastest-growing segment thanks to its growing portfolio of AI services. Businesses and developers can access the latest data center infrastructure and ready-made large language models, including Gemini, on Google Cloud to build their own AI applications.\n\nAlphabet is also weaving Gemini into its other products, such as Google Docs and Gmail, offering a productivity boost to customers who can now use AI to rapidly craft content in those applications. Longer-term, Alphabet is reportedly negotiating with Apple to make Gemini the default AI chatbot on that company's devices, including the iPhone. Details are scarce, but it could be an incredible opportunity, considering Apple has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices worldwide.\n\nI think Ackman made a spectacular bet on Alphabet, and his $1.9 billion position is likely to continue to grow in value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Most of the major stock market indexes dropped over -1% on Wednesday as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% year over year in March and was up 0.4% from the previous month.\n\nAccelerating from February’s 3.2% YoY uptick, another hot inflationary reading is starting to leave doubt that the Fed will implement three rate cuts in 2024 and may instead shift to two cuts later in the year.\n\nWhile this was the catalyst for today’s broader market selloff here are two highly-ranked Zacks stocks that were able to withstand the pullback and should serve as viable buy-the-dip candidates if the opportunity is presented. U.S. Bureau OF Labor Statistics\n\nImage Source: U.S. Bureau OF Labor Statistics\n\nNvidia NVDA\n\nInvestors searching their watchlist to see if Nvidia’s stock cratered in today’s market selloff may have been surprised to see NVDA up +2%. Although Nvidia’s stock is 12% from its highs of $974 a share seen in early March, today’s resistance was reassuring as NVDA was able to hold its 50-day moving average and is comfortably above the 200-day. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, with Nvidia right at the cusp of its 50-day moving average, meeting this SMA (Simple Moving Average) and bouncing upwards after doing so is typically considered a long-term entry point. It wouldn’t be surprising if this scenario materializes given that earnings estimate revisions are noticeably higher for the AI chip leader over the last 60 days and the Average Zacks Price Target of $912.12 a share suggests 7% upside from current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGlobal Partners GLP\n\nPointing out Global Partners' “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value is very intriguing considering crude oil prices have stayed on a bullish course towards $90 a barrel which many analysts see by the summer. Notably, the energy sector was higher on Wednesday with Global Partners stock up +1% as broader markets fell. Yahoo Finance\n\nImage Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nControlling one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products on the East Coast, Global Partners’ annual earnings are expected to rise 4% this year and are projected to jump another 14% in FY25 to $4.47 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore compelling is that GLP trades at 11.4X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the Zacks Oil and Gas-Refining and Marketing-Master Limited Partnerships Industry average of 13.4X and the S&P 500’s 21.9X. Plus, Global Partners stock trades well below its decade-long P/E highs and at a 38% discount to the median of 18.6X. It’s also noteworthy that GLP has a 6.26% annual dividend yield and earnings estimate revisions are slighlty up in the last two months for both FY24 and FY25.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors may be on edge for more market volatility but buying the dip in Nvidia or Global Partners stock should pay off if the opportunity is presented. To that point, both stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $870.39, marking a +1.97% move from the previous day. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.95% for the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.09%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.84%.\n\nThe maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen a decrease of 7.14% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.67% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.78%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.48, showcasing a 402.75% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $24.17 billion, indicating a 236.08% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $23.84 per share and a revenue of $105.13 billion, demonstrating changes of +83.95% and +72.56%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 3.09% upward. Nvidia presently features a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 35.8. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 24.57 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that NVDA currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.16. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 2.25 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, positioning it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The dividend kings are a select group of dividend stocks made up of companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. That may be a throw-away statistic. But consider everything that’s happened to the economy in the past 50 years.\n\nBeing able to continually issue a dividend speaks to the blue-chip nature of these companies. They deliver rock-solid revenue and earnings with a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nNaysayers will say those dividend payments come at the expense of growth. And, it’s true that you won’t find an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) among this group of stocks. But that’s not to say you won’t get share price appreciation and possible market-beating growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn 2024, only 54 stocks have earned the distinction of being a dividend king. And the three dividend stocks we’ll explore have the added benefit of receiving one or more strong buy ratings from analysts.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1886, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock has been a tough hold in the last year. The stock was down around 7.8% in that time. And 2024 isn’t getting off to a much better start with JNJ down 2.9%.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant will be paying the settlement in its talc lawsuit for some time to come. And investors are now pricing the stock without its consumer products division that it spun off and now trades as Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE).\n\nBut things could change quickly, Johnson & Johnson plans to buy Shockwave Medical (NYSE:SWAV) for $13.1 billion. The deal still must be approved by Shockwave shareholders. But if it goes through, JNJ will have access to Shockwave’s first-to-market Intravascular Lithotripsy technology (ILT).\n\nAnother potential catalyst is that JNJ stock is cheap at just 11x trailing earnings and 14x forward earnings. The consensus price target of 19 analysts is $176.38, which marks a 15.9% upside. Plus, 7 out of 23 analysts give the stock a strong buy rating.\n\nGorman-Rupp (GRC) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.\n\nSource: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com\n\nGorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) is a picks and shovel play on the country’s need to bolster its infrastructure. GRC makes pumps and pumping systems primarily for water-related products.\n\nThe company has delivered higher year-over-year (YOY) revenue and earnings in each of the last four quarters. Also, it’s increasing its cash while decreasing its debt, which justifies the 64% gain in the GRC stock price.\n\nAt 24x forward earnings, some investors may feel that Gorman-Rupp is richly valued. To be fair, you’re largely on your own when it comes to assessing GRC stock. Gorman-Rupp is a small-cap company with a market cap of just over $1 billion. Only two analysts have issued a 12-month price target for the stock. Yet both give GRC an upside of about 10%. Plus, the one analyst that has issued a rating in the last three months gives the stock a strong buy rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past five years, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has proven that it’s not just one of the best dividend stocks investors can own, it’s one of the best stocks period.\n\nIf you’re looking for growth, WMT is up 81% in the past five years. And if it’s income you’re looking for, Walmart has a highly reliable dividend that has increased for 52 consecutive years.\n\nIn 2023, the retailer continued to be a go-to location for consumers looking to get some relief from inflation. Walmart hasn’t been immune to the effects of inflation and notes that its consumers are prioritizing staple items over discretionary goods.\n\nThat’s why the company did post YOY gains in revenue and earnings. Plus, the company is forecasting high single-digit earnings growth in the next 12 months.\n\nCurrently, the stock trades for 31x earnings, and some investors may be concerned about its valuation. That could be a reason the stock has pulled back about 0.45% in the last month. But, analysts are forecasting 9.5% share price growth, and 26 out of 39 analysts give WMT stock a strong buy rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The tech sector has been on an upward trend ever since AI came into the spotlight. Some companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), saw massive growth in industry coverage and valuations and have shown no signs of slowing. However, a high-performing sector does not equate to all stocks performing well. Some stocks get battered during the sector’s upward journey — this drop allows us to look at discounted tech stocks to buy.\n\nFor courageous investors willing to take the chance, looking for oversold stocks during a bull market can be a golden opportunity to buy a stock before it bounces back. While a contrarian approach is a high-risk strategy, you can win big if you get the timing right.\n\nThe question now is which stock to choose. Companies performing poorly with trading prices but showing earnings growth might be attractive picks — and I have three for your consideration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOppFi (OPFI) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAI may be the darling of the tech sector, but fintech will always have its place in an evolving economy. For example, companies like OppFi (NYSE:OPFI) help Americans gain access to credit through its specialty products. The company uses an AI-powered proprietary algorithm that helps its customers opt into its programs, like the OppFi TurnUp Program, which helps them find affordable credit options in the market.\n\nOppFi offers a payroll deduction scheme for its customers under its SalaryTap as part of its secured installment loan offering.\n\nOppFi ended FY’23 strong, with nine consecutive positive net income years.\n\nFor 2023, the company reported a respectable 12.4% revenue growth, a massive 1082% net income growth, and another excellent 763.0% adjusted EPS growth.\n\nIts CEO, Todd Schwartz, emphasized OppFi’s commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and profitability and scaling its expenses efficiently for FY’24. While it may be underperforming in the market, it’s consistent profitability and strong management make OPFI stock worth adding to your tech stocks to buy list.\n\nLantronix (LTRX) Digital data flow on road with motion blur to create vision of fast speed transfer. Concept of future digital transformation, disruptive innovation and agile business methodology. LTRX stock\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a high-potential technology that could shape the future. Companies like Lantronix (NASDAQ:LTRX) are some of the players in the market that want to take advantage of this potential. The tech could be a game changer for various industries, enterprises, and smart cities.\n\nLantronix offers remote environment management Software as a Service (SaaS) and turnkey solutions for the IoT. The company recently announced the release of Percepxion, an easy-to-deploy pre-configured IoT solution that allows customers to connect to its existing connect and compute products. It also expanded the M110 Mobility Solutions family, which is pre-configured with Percepxion IoT Software.\n\nStory continues\n\nLTRX stock is down about 44% YTD, offering investors a chance to pick it up at a nice discount and ranking it as one of the potential tech stocks to buy. Meanwhile, the company’s financial report shows a different trend.\n\nLantronix reported a record revenue of $37 million for Q2 ’24, representing an 18% YOY increase, doubling its non-GAAP EPS from $0.04 the prior year to $0.08.\n\nIn addition, the company anticipates continued growth with full-year revenue ranging from $155-$165 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.35-$0.45 per share.\n\nWith a growing portfolio of products and impressive financial results, its current price performance weakness may be the best time for investors to take advantage of Lantronix’s growth potential.\n\nCalix (CALX) rural broadband: a cell phone tower over a long stretch of hills and forest\n\nSource: Steve Heap / Shutterstock\n\nCalix (NYSE:CALX) offers its subscribers various managed services that enable broadband service providers to innovate and transform their businesses. Its platform includes Calix Cloud, Revenue EDGE and Intelligent Access EDGE, which helps gather data that uses machine learning to provide real-time insights to its customers.\n\nThe company previously announced that it remains the sole company with the TR-369 and TR-398 Broadband Forum certifications. Having sole certification on these broadband protocols highlights the strength of Calix’s business.\n\nThe company ended FY’23 with excellent numbers, benefitting from its strong cloud and managed services portfolio. Revenue grew 19.8% YOY and Calix expects Q1 ’24 EPS to end between $0.17 and $0.23 with revenues around $225-$231 million. Despite its short-term challenges and underperformance, its growth expectations and upcoming surge in broadband investment can be worthy catalysts for picking it up when it finds a bottom.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI will change work, for better and worse",
        "content": "It’s been both fascinating and alarming to watch the generative AI explosion unfold. A new, interesting technology has captured the public’s imagination thanks to its ability to generate everything from text to video. But there are fears those same capabilities make it a potential threat to a host of jobs ranging from programmers and artists to human resources workers and financial professionals.\n\nThere’s little doubt generative AI will impact some jobs. According to Intel, we could eventually see the rise of AI technologies so powerful they’ll replace entire corporate departments. But the generative AI job-pocalypse won’t destroy every job it touches. As with all things, it’s a bit more complicated than that. And the truth is, there’s still a lot we don’t know.\n\n“It is going to be a major disruption that unfolds over many years, at least 10 years,” Columbia Business School professor Daniel Keum told Yahoo Finance. “And it'll create losers and winners. But what that exactly looks like, we don't know.”\n\nAccording to experts, generative AI will make some jobs easier, while creating others. The thinking is similar to how the internet and e-commerce displaced some positions while helping to bring about entirely new categories of jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella are championing AI in the workplace. (AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“It might be an existential threat to a very narrow set of jobs just like any technology,” explained professor Sonny Tambe, co-director of The Wharton School’s AI at Wharton program.And we’ve seen these kinds of changes before.\n\n“Even something much more general purpose like, say, a tractor, has a large impact on a narrow set of jobs,” Tambe said. “For most of us, I think it is actually a really useful tool, but not an existential threat, necessarily.”\n\nWe still don’t know what jobs are most at risk\n\nAccording to a July Pew Research Center report, 19% of jobs will have some kind of exposure to generative AI. That means AI will augment some parts of those positions, though not necessarily replace them.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperts I spoke with said customer service workers, tax preparers, and others could face pressure as companies begin using generative AI-powered chatbots to answer customer queries or instantly fill documents. However, if you’ve used a chatbot to try to get a comprehensive answer to questions about anything from your health insurance to how to return a shirt, you know they can be frustratingly ineffective.\n\nHarvard Business School professor Andy Wu says generative AI could lead to the creation of programs that respond to voice directions. According to Wu, users could someday control complex apps like Adobe’s (ADBE) Photoshop using natural language instructions, meaning rather than clicking through menus to edit photos, they’ll simply be able to tell apps how they want an image to look.\n\nThat could help photo editors by making their jobs easier or give middle managers an easy reason to replace them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays shows off the company's latest AI chips at Nvidia GDC 2024. (Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, many of these tools are still flawed as well. Generative AI images feature glaring errors like people with oddly placed hands or Google’s multicultural Nazis. Generative AI chatbots are also prone to hallucinations, a fancy term for errors that seem authoritative. Even AI transcription apps often pick up the wrong words.\n\nNew jobs will emerge\n\nJust as AI is all but certain to impact some jobs, it will also help create new opportunities. Take the Photoshop app example. By making apps and services more easy to access, more people can begin using them, bringing more creativity into various fields.\n\nWith the advent of blogs and social networks, more people than ever can share their thoughts with the world, something you previously needed a media organization to do.\n\nAnd with the development of large graphics engines from the likes of Unity and Epic, individual programmers can develop their own games rather than relying on an entire fleet of developers. That doesn’t mean programmers for big-name games have gone away, but rather that gamers can now get access to both highly polished major game releases and independent games.\n\nIt will take time before we feel the full impact of AI\n\nWhether good or bad, it’ll likely be some time before we feel the full force of generative AI’s impact on the job market. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“If you look at the data, less than 10% of US firms report that they've adopted [generative AI] in some fashion, and probably still in an experimental phase,” Pew Research Center senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar told Yahoo Finance. “So we don't know. It’s too early to say which way things are going.”\n\nOf course, if you listen to Big Tech companies ranging from Nvidia and Microsoft to Google and Intel, we’ll start feeling generative AI’s changes any day now. But the reality is that it will still take years, if not more, to sort out the technology’s impact on the job market.\n\nRemember how self-driving trucks were supposed to steal truckers’ jobs? That’s still far from reality. And early predictions that self-driving cars would be ferrying us around by now? Those have fallen decidedly flat.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is deploying a new homegrown chip to help power its artificial intelligence services, aiming to decrease its reliance on semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. and other outside companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nThe chip, announced Wednesday, is the latest version of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA, which helps rank and recommend content across Facebook and Instagram. Meta released the first MTIA product last year.\n\nMeta’s pivot to AI services has brought increased demand for computing power. Last year, the social media giant released its own version of an AI model to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It also added new generative AI features to its social apps, including customized stickers and celebrity-faced chatbot characters.\n\nIn October, the company said it would spend as much as $35 billion on infrastructure to support AI, including data centers and hardware. “AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told investors that month.\n\nA significant amount of that spending will likely still flow to Nvidia, which builds the popular H100 graphics cards that power AI models. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said the company would acquire 350,000 of those chips, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nBut there’s a growing movement among tech giants to develop chips in-house. Meta is joining rivals Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in trying to wean themselves off a very expensive dependency. It won’t be a quick fix, though. So far, the efforts haven’t made a dent in the industry’s insatiable need for Nvidia’s AI accelerators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI boom has helped turn Nvidia into the world’s third-most-valuable tech company, behind only Microsoft and Apple Inc. Its sales to data center operators totaled $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024, up from just $15 billion the year before. Analysts predict that the sum will more than double again in fiscal 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.’s record-breaking, artificial intelligence-fueled rally has added $1 trillion in market value since its darkest days of 2022, and yet by some perspectives it’s still trading at a discount.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Apple’s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Billion in China Shift US Core CPI Tops Forecasts Again, Likely Delaying Fed Rate Cuts\n\nIts shares traded at 24 times estimated earnings early Wednesday, roughly in line with their 10-year average and just below the 25 times of the Nasdaq 100. Among the Magnificent Seven group of big tech companies, only Alphabet Inc., with a multiple of about 21, is cheaper.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the biggest driver of gains and the largest future tailwind investors see for the stock. Meta has been heavily investing in AI to improve ad targeting and recommend content to its massive user base, a bet investors see paying off big time. Profits tripled in the social media giant’s most recent quarterly report while revenue growth surged. The earnings were so strong that Meta also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend.\n\n“Outside of chip or hardware companies like Nvidia or Dell, no company has benefited more from AI than Meta, just in terms of the impact on growth,” said Conrad van Tienhoven, a portfolio manager at Riverpark Capital. “There’s been a clear shift in Meta’s ability to target and measure ads through AI, and executing on this has set the company up for another five to seven years of growth.”\n\nMeta has soared more than 450% from its nadir almost 18 months ago, including a gain of about 46% this year that’s behind only chipmaker Nvidia Corp. among the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe selloff that preceded the current rebound erased more than three-fourths of Meta’s valuation and featured a historic wipeout in market value, largely due to concerns over spending on the its metaverse initiative. While the Menlo Park, California-based company continues to invest in that virtual reality world, it also made cost cuts a focus, dubbing 2023 the “Year of Efficiency.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Meta has figured out how to get rid of unnecessary spending, which has been a real balance sheet plus, and it continues to innovate. If you’re late to the game, there’s always some drawdown risk buying this high, but I don’t see a reason to get out,”said Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanely strategist. “When I look out five or 10 years to where Meta could be, it still looks like a great core holding that is trading at a very favorable price.”\n\nRead More: Magnificent Seven? It’s More Like the Blazing Two and Tepid Five\n\nOf course, investors looking for exposure to ad revenue could also snap up Alphabet, which has a cheaper valuation and has gained about 12% this year, a much more modest performance than Meta’s rally. Though Wall Street is bullish on both names, average price targets signal that analysts see slightly more upside for Alphabet at current levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, Alphabet continues to face investor skepticism over its AI products and ability to translate them to growth. Meta is expected to deliver bigger revenue gains this year, with estimates at 17%, compared with 12% for Alphabet. Net earnings growth at Meta is expected to be roughly twice as strong.\n\nRBC Capital Markets wrote that Meta is “clearly outperforming” Alphabet, its biggest rival in the market for digital advertising, citing its own analysis of spending in the digital ad industry in an April 3 note. RBC raised its price target on Meta to $600 from $565, saying that its outperformance over Alphabet prompts a higher multiple.\n\nMeta is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings results on April 24 after the market close. Top of mind for investors is ad revenue growth, how AI solutions are working and how the company can monetize products such as Reels.\n\n“I’m dying for updates on all of that,” said Scott Acheychek, CEO of Rex Shares LLC.\n\nMeta’s dominant position has also been put into sharp relief by struggles at its social-media peers. Both Pinterest Inc. and Snap Inc. have reported weak sales, putting the stocks in negative territory for the year, while the newly public Reddit Inc. has failed to generate much excitement from analysts.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik wrote that mid-sized social platforms could be “structurally disadvantaged and too sub-scale to compete” in Meta’s shadow.\n\n“What hope is there for the smaller social players including Reddit to reach engagement, monetization, and profitability levels seen over at Meta — the North Star?” he wrote, starting coverage on Reddit with an underperform rating.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida have enlisted Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. to fund a new joint artificial intelligence research program, as the two nations look to improve collaboration around the quickly emerging technology. Apple Inc. assembled $14 billion of iPhones in India in the last fiscal year, doubling production in a sign it’s accelerating a push to diversify beyond China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in AI development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers. BMW AG’s sales of fully electric vehicles at its core brand surged in the first quarter, outperforming rivals like Tesla and Volkswagen, which have struggled to cope with faltering demand.\n\nEarnings due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stock-picking hedge funds gained more than any other major strategy in the first quarter thanks to some high-flying tech names — and it still wasn’t good enough to beat the markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Apple’s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Billion in China Shift US Core CPI Tops Forecasts Again, Likely Delaying Fed Rate Cuts\n\nAs a group, stock-pickers gained 7.9% during the first three months of the year, according to PivotalPath’s Equity Sector Index. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index returned 10.6% and 9.3%, respectively.\n\nSeveral top equity hedge funds fell short of those marks, including Renaissance Technologies, Greenlight Capital and Pershing Square Capital Management — which all landed near the bottom of the group — as well as tech-focused firms such as Viking Global Investors, Coatue Management and Tiger Global Management.\n\nAs for some of the stock-pickers that managed to beat the benchmarks, those gains were largely driven by wagers on a small number of tech names in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, including Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Investors paying high fees for hedge funds tend to favor returns that are uncoupled with markets or come from less popular trades.\n\n“There’s not a whole lot of impressive equity performance this year,” PivotalPath’s Jon Caplis, who founded the hedge fund research firm, said in a interview. “Many of the returns are being driven by large tech stocks. Equities have risen across other sectors and across geographies, too, so it’s hard not to be making money.”\n\nRead more: Oldest Hedge Fund Strategy Wins Cash After Two-Year Exodus\n\nMany hedge funds that ratcheted back exposure to equities during the 2022 stock-market rout have been slow to restore it to typical levels, Caplis said. That’s particularly true of some tech-focused funds. While the average tech fund ramped up its exposure to the Nasdaq by 37% — the highest level since May 2022 — that’s still far from a peak at the start of that year, PivotalPath data show.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight Street Capital Management, which oversees $760 million, returned more than 35% in the first quarter, and Whale Rock Capital Management gained more than 22%. Nvidia was Light Street’s largest holding as of Dec. 31, while Microsoft Corp., Meta, Amazon and Nvidia were top picks for Whale Rock, regulatory filings show.\n\nThose four stocks accounted for more than 46% of the S&P 500’s gain in the first quarter.\n\nAdam Singleton, chief investment officer of external alpha at Man Solutions, expressed concern that momentum in popular stocks can lead to crowded trades, heightening the risk of heavy losses if they quickly unravel.\n\n“I have seldom felt so nervous,” Singleton wrote in a report earlier this month. Momentum trades have done well this year, “suggesting that winning trades keep on winning, which is either driven by or leads to crowding.”\n\nIt’s hard to effectively measure the risk of crowding and, as a result, it’s difficult for hedge fund investors to avoid, he wrote.\n\nYet demand is growing. Stock-picking funds attracted a net $1.5 billion in February — the first inflows in two years — according to data platform Nasdaq eVestment. And tech-focused funds may be back in favor.\n\nRead More: Oldest Hedge Fund Strategy Wins Cash After Two-Year Exodus\n\n“After a couple of choppy years, we’re seeing investors in hedge funds now starting to eye tech managers, by doing research and taking meetings again — hoping to capitalize on the recent momentum in equities,” said Jon Naga, head of business development at Williams Trading, which advises hedge funds on raising capital.\n\nEquity hedge funds as a group beat most multistrategy funds, including the Schonfeld Strategic Partners fund, a top performer that gained 6.2%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "The AI gold rush has turned several chip stocks into globally important firms. Of course, none has become more important than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company’s AI accelerator GPUs are in high demand. Share prices have surged to astronomical levels, leading some to believe they are overvalued. While that may or may not be the case, we are looking for overlooked chip stocks today.\n\nSome firms are connected to the AI gold rush, while others possess different catalysts. Regardless, each represents an undervalued opportunity as chip stocks continue to strengthen.\n\nThe tube sector is notoriously cyclical. It ebbs and flows. Thus, investors who catch cyclicality at the correct times can make out handsomely. These undervalued chip stocks represent a way to capture those gains potentially.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSTMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is a strong stock choice in the auto chip application sector. The automotive semiconductor industry has not fared exceptionally well of late. That’s part of the reason STMicroelectronics remains undervalued. Combine that with the fact that the company doesn’t have much connection to generative AI and a contrarian opportunity merges.\n\nThe company provides processors and microcontrollers primarily applicable to the automotive sector. The opportunity there broadly relates to the continued adoption of electric vehicles. EVs require roughly twice the number of chips as do traditional cars. That suggests STMicroelectronics will continue to have a strong opportunity to satisfy future demand.\n\nThe stock’s P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that suggest it is undervalued and continues to present an opportunity to investors. Shares are cheaper than 92% of semiconductor competitors based on that metric. An overview of STMicroelectronics’ fundamentals suggests it is a well-run company.\n\nIndie Semiconductor (INDI) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIndie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI) is another automotive chip that appears to be undervalued. Vehicle autonomy and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) represent strong growth. The ADAS market will grow at an annual rate of 12% between this year and 2030.\n\nMorgan Stanley also recognized Indie Semiconductor as the fastest-growing semiconductor company in the world over the past two years. Revenues surged past $70 million during the fourth quarter. That represented 112% growth on a year-over-year basis. 2023 revenues also reached triple-digit growth, increasing by 101%.\n\nThe company is projecting that Q1 revenues will grow by nearly 40%. Indie Semiconductor isn’t undervalued based on traditional metrics but rather because its growth remains underappreciated currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be completely clear, Indie Semiconductor is a riskier investment than other chip makers. The opportunity here will materialize once rate cuts are enacted. Those cuts have been notoriously difficult to predict with any accuracy. However, that’s what investors should look for.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on traditional metrics, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) doesn’t stand out as an undervalued chip stock. However, if recent history has taught us anything, metrics don’t matter in the chip sector.\n\nAnd, of course, reference stocks like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Pricing for chips with a strong connection to the AI opportunity is notoriously fickle. The fundamentals suggest that a share should be priced for much less. If it has a strong connection to AI, it doesn’t matter.\n\nThat’s precisely the story with Micron Technology.\n\nIt all comes down to the opportunity to have high bandwidth memory. In that regard, Micron Technology has been selected as a critical partner to Nvidia. High bandwidth memory can increase the power of artificial intelligence chips.\n\nThe company also recently reported strong results for fiscal quarter Q2 2024. Thus, Micron Technology appears undervalued based on its connection to and opportunity within high bandwidth memory. It can become a vital supplier to Nvidia and other leading AI chip firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy” first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Strategy underperformed the benchmark in the quarter. The small-cap growth universe revealed a stark dichotomy despite the positive performance of the benchmark Russell 2000 Growth Index, which returned 7.58% in the first quarter. The Strategy posted gains in 5 of the nine sectors in which it was invested on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection detracted from performance, partially offset by positive sector allocation effects on a relative basis. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy featured stocks NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On April 9, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $853.54 per share.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $2.134 trillion.\n\nClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"While large cap benchmarks get a lot of attention for a handful of mega cap stocks driving the lion's share of performance, we would highlight even more extreme and unprecedented concentration in small cap benchmarks. Year to date, one stock, Super Micro Computer has driven 37% of the return of the benchmark, closely followed by MicroStrategy, a unique stock that is largely considered a bitcoin proxy. Together, they accounted for over half of the benchmark's first quarter return. This compares to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which accounted for 24% of the return of the S&P 500 Index. The 32 top-performing stocks in the Russell 2000 Growth Index accounted for 100% of its return, versus 81 names driving the S&P 500's performance this quarter.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "Although Wall Street offers few guarantees, short-term volatility is one of them. Since the curtain opened on 2020, Wall Street's three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years (through 2023).\n\nWhen equities are getting whipsawed by uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to seek the safety of industry-leading stocks, such as the companies that make up the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPatient investors have gravitated to the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. Listed in descending order of current market cap (as of April 5, 2024), these seven titans are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two defining traits that have made the Magnificent Seven such popular holdings for investors. To start with, they're undeniable outperformers. Over the trailing decade, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a rock-solid 182%. Comparatively, Nvidia's stock has zoomed higher by approximately 19,230%, the shares of Amazon and Tesla have gained more than 1,000%, and Alphabet is bringing up the caboose with a gain of \"only\" 464% from its Class A shares (GOOGL). MSFT Chart\n\nThe other reason investors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven is because they all offer clearly defined competitive advantages or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure service platform Azure ranks second in global market share. Meanwhile, Windows remains the clear leader in desktop operating systems. Apple's iPhone has accounted for a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable versions in 2020. Apple also has the largest share repurchase program on Wall Street. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for a 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon sits at the top of the pack in e-commerce and among cloud infrastructure service platforms. Its e-commerce marketplace oversaw nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) gobbled up a 31% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the September-ended quarter. Alphabet's Google has a virtual monopoly in global internet search, with a 91% share in March 2024. Alphabet is also the parent of the second-most-visited social network (YouTube) and the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms' social media networks attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) during the December-ended quarter. This includes Facebook, which alone lured in 3.07 billion MAUs. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's been generating a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced almost 1.85 million EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors have been selling all but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nBut in spite of the overwhelming success of the Magnificent Seven, many of Wall Street's most prominent billionaire investors began kicking these outperformers to the curb during the December-ended quarter.\n\nAll told, six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks were either jettisoned from billionaires' portfolios or meaningfully pared down, including:\n\nNvidia: Eight highly successful billionaire money managers reduced their positions in this AI titan, with Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold), Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold), and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) leading the way. Microsoft: Seven accomplished billionaires were sellers of Microsoft stock in the December-ended quarter, including Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares sold) and Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares sold), who both closed out their respective funds' positions. Alphabet: Seven top-tier billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Alphabet during the fourth quarter. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont (3,302,342 shares sold), Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel (3,113,001 shares sold), and Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman (1,278,300 shares sold) were the respective top sellers. Meta Platforms: Six tenured billionaires gave shares of Meta the boot in the quarter ended in December. The top sellers included Jeff Yass of Susquehanna (3,037,082 shares sold) and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global (1,430,767 shares sold). Apple: Four respected billionaire money managers reduced their stakes in Apple during the fourth quarter. This included Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who oversaw the sale of a little over 10 million shares of Apple. Tesla: A total of three well-known billionaire investors sold shares of EV maker Tesla in the final quarter of 2023. Billionaires John Overdeck and David Siegel, who co-founded Two Sigma Investments, saw their funds sell all 1,015,385 shares of Tesla they'd owned as of the previous quarter.\n\nThe one name missing from this list, and the only Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires are absolutely piling into, is e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the fourth quarter, eight billionaires added shares of Amazon to their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why billionaire investors can't stop buying Amazon stock\n\nIf you're wondering why billionaires are buying shares of Amazon stock while paring down or exiting their stakes in the other Magnificent Seven stocks, look no further than Amazon's trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments: AWS, advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates very low margins. The bulk of the cash flow and operating income Amazon produces come from its trio of ancillary segments.\n\nNone of these segments is more important than AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit sales growth should be the expectation for AWS. Even though this segment only accounted for a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it provided about two-thirds of its operating income.\n\nAmazon's advertising operations are another source of sustained growth. In a typical month, Amazon's website is the destination for well over 2 billion visitors, many of whom are motivated shoppers. This makes Amazon one of the primary platforms that merchants want to target when getting their message(s) in front of consumers.\n\nThe third key operating division is subscription services. The last time Amazon updated its global Prime subscription count was April 2021, when then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company had surpassed 200 million. With Amazon gaining the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, there's a high likelihood this subscription total has jumped further.\n\nCollectively, the lure of these higher-growth segments is their cash flow generation. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock. Patient investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for just 13 times consensus cash flow in 2025. Even approaching its previous all-time high, Amazon stock is historically inexpensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven,\" All Eyes Should Be on the \"Fab Four\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the broader market last year. This group of the world's largest technology companies impressed with 2023 returns ranging between 48% and 238%. That's impressive for companies already worth trillions of dollars in some cases!\n\nBut 2024 has represented a changing of the guard of sorts. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have hit some headwinds. The remaining group of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) continue to rally, resembling a new group, a \"Fab Four\" that continues to carry the market to all-time highs.\n\nCan they continue to separate themselves from the pack?\n\nForget the Magnificent Seven and embrace the Fab Four. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA changing of the guard in 2024\n\nApple, Tesla, and Alphabet haven't kept up the pace since 2024 began. Alphabet's year-to-date gains have \"only\" tracked the S&P 500, while Apple and Tesla have started to slide. Apple and Tesla are reporting hiccups in their growth efforts. Tesla's deliveries began 2024 with a thud, while Apple is dealing with weakness in China, a vital market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Alphabet is experiencing its first threat to its monopoly on search engine traffic from generative artificial intelligence (AI). AAPL Chart\n\nThese massive companies can't maintain these tremendous investment returns if they don't deliver the performance to back up those high expectations. Analysts have dramatically soured on Tesla's near-term growth outlook, and Apple's valuation got too hot for the growth it was putting on the table.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" enjoy growth tailwinds\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven form the Fab Four, thanks primarily to expected tailwinds from artificial intelligence over the coming years. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, which are needed to power the massive computer systems that run AI. Amazon and Microsoft operate the world's two largest cloud platforms, the underpinnings of the internet, and what will be various AI applications. Lastly, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI for digital advertising while investing heavily in augmented reality.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth these opportunities will create, calling for annualized long-term earnings growth ranging from 15% to 35% over the next three to five years.\n\nValuations say the momentum can continue\n\nHow much you pay for a stock always matters. It's not that Tesla, Alphabet, and Apple can't succeed in the future, but their valuations have become too disconnected from what the market expects growth to look like.\n\nInvestors can use the PEG ratio to compare a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth to determine whether shares are still a good value. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf you use the data from the above charts, the Fab Four have the following PEG ratios:\n\nNvidia: 1 Amazon: 1.9 Microsoft: 2.4 Meta: 1.3\n\nThe lower the PEG ratio is, the better the value. I generally look to buy when PEG ratios are under 1.5, so Nvidia and Meta remain excellent deals if they can deliver the growth analysts expect from them. Amazon is a bit more expensive but is a more capital-intensive company. If you price the stock to its operating cash flow, its valuation is still below its decade average. Admittedly, Microsoft is beginning to look expensive, so investors may want to think twice before buying shares.\n\nAll the companies in the Magnificent Seven are among the best in their respective industries and could easily be long-term winners. But the cream eventually rises to the top, which could be Nvidia and Meta Platforms based on the numbers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Regret Missing Nvidia's Stunning Rally? 1 Incredible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Company Is Worth $1 Trillion",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, as customers line up to buy its powerful graphics cards so that they don't miss out on the fast-growing adoption of this technology that's expected to give the global economy a huge boost.\n\nAccording to PwC, AI could add a whopping $15.7 trillion to global GDP (gross domestic product) by 2030. Nvidia will play a central role in driving this AI-related economic growth thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which play a major role in training large language models (LLMs) and developing AI applications.\n\nAll this explains why Nvidia has been growing at a breathtaking pace, leading to an impressive surge in its stock price. NVDA Chart\n\nHowever, Nvidia's rally wouldn't have been possible without its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC. That's because Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, which means that it only designs its chips but leaves the manufacturing part to foundries such as TSMC.\n\nSo investors looking for an Nvidia proxy to play the AI boom would do well to buy shares of TSMC, as it looks set to join the trillion-dollar market cap club thanks to the impressive upside it is likely to deliver. Let's see why that may be the case.\n\nTSMC's capacity expansion should help accelerate its growth\n\nTSMC has been rapidly expanding its manufacturing capacity to help Nvidia meet the terrific demand for its AI chips. The company has allocated an estimated 40% to 50% of its advanced chip packaging capacity to Nvidia so that the latter can increase its AI chip supply, according to market research firm TrendForce.\n\nMore importantly, TSMC is reportedly going to increase its advanced chip packaging -- formally known as a chip on wafer and wafer on substrate (CoWoS) -- capacity to 240,000 units this year from 120,000 units last year. By the end of the year, TSMC is expected to ramp up its monthly CoWoS packaging capacity to 26,000 to 28,000 wafers a month, suggesting that Nvidia could continue to improve the output of its AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, TSMC has now received a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. government, along with a $5 billion loan facility, so that it can build more factories in Arizona. TSMC is already building two facilities in Arizona that will go online in 2025 and 2028, and it is now going to build a third site following the latest grant. In all, TSMC is set to spend $65 billion on the three U.S. plants.\n\nThe third plant will be set up for manufacturing advanced 2-nanometer (nm) chips, which will be deployed for AI and military applications. It is worth noting that TSMC is expected to begin the trial production of 2nm chips for Nvidia so that it can start mass-producing these chips in 2025.\n\nThe move to a 2nm process is likely to play an important role in helping Nvidia maintain its dominance in the AI chip market. For instance, by moving from a custom 5nm architecture for its Hopper AI GPUs to a custom 4nm process from TSMC for its upcoming Blackwell GPUs, Nvidia is claiming that it can deliver a 7x to 30x jump over its current flagship H100 processor, while also reducing power consumption by up to 25 times.\n\nSo TSMC looks all set to benefit from Nvidia's AI chip dominance, and this should ideally help drive stronger growth in the company's revenue and earnings. That's probably the reason why analysts have significantly bumped their earnings growth expectations for TSMC. TSM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe stock's valuation and potential upside indicate that buying it is a no-brainer\n\nTSMC stock trades at 28 times trailing earnings and 23 times forward earnings. Both multiples are lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). We saw in the chart in the previous section that TSMC's bottom line could jump just over $9 per share in 2026.\n\nAssuming TSMC does hit that mark and trades at 30 times earnings after three years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could hit $270 -- an 86% jump from current levels. TSMC currently commands a market cap of $750 billion, which means that it is well on course to join the trillion-dollar market cap club within the next three years.\n\nAll this indicates why investors looking for an AI stock trading at an attractive valuation should consider buying TSMC hand over fist, as it seems built for terrific upside that could help take its market cap well beyond $1 trillion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Google announced a proprietary chip Tuesday that could help the company cut back its reliance on heavyweight chipmakers and gain a foothold in the increasingly competitive AI race.\n\nThe new chip, dubbed Axion, will help handle the massive amount of data used by AI applications, Google said in a Tuesday statement. It’s designed to be grouped into clusters of thousands of chips to improve performance, the Wall Street Journalreported.\n\nThe new chips—which are central processing units, or CPUs—are reportedly 30% better than already available “general-purpose” chips that use similar circuitry made by the U.K.-based semiconductor and software company Arm, the company said in a statement. Although Google had previously made other chips for its different business segments, this is its first meant to support AI in data centers.\n\nCustomers of the Alphabet subsidiary will be able to access Axion through Google’s cloud business later this year, but will not be able to buy them directly, according to the Journal. The company’s vice president overseeing proprietary chips, Amin Vahdat, told the outlet that it wants to take a different approach.\n\n“Becoming a great hardware company is very different from becoming a great cloud company or a great organizer of the world’s information,” Vahdat said.\n\nBy not selling directly to customers, Google is avoiding direct competition with its longtime partners—and dominant chipmakers—Intel and Nvidia. Instead, Vahdat said, the company sees its entry into the chip market as a positive for everyone in the industry.\n\n“I see this as a basis for growing the size of the pie,” Vahdat said.\n\nAs the hypercompetitive race to enable AI heats up, Google’s rivals likely don’t share that vision. On Tuesday, Santa Clara, Calif.–based semiconductor company Intel released the artificial-intelligence-focused chip Gaudi 3. Intel says the new chips will be available by the third quarter, and can be used to train large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The company claims the Gaudi 3 chips have an edge over Nvidia’s competing chip, the H100.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, announced the new generation of its popular H100 chip in November and plans to release it later this year. Still, shares of Nvidia closed down 2% on Tuesday following the news. The company has seen its stock skyrocket about 75% since the start of the year on outsize demand for its powerful H100 chips, but is facing increasing competition.\n\nShares of Google parent company Alphabet jumped as much as 2.4% on the day following news of the new chip before paring back gains. The stock closed up 1.28% at about $158.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "It seemed inevitable that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock wouldn't keep up its torrid pace after more than tripling over the last year. The stock has finally begun to give back a small slice of those gains in recent weeks.\n\nThat downturn extended today after Barron's highlighted an analyst report that threw cold water on many investors' growth predictions for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) computer chip sales. Shares dropped nearly 5% and were still down by 2.8% as of 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) dominance ending\n\nNvidia has been dominant in the supply of hardware and even software for the high-powered computing needs generated by the onset of so many AI applications. Megacap technology companies including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and even Tesla have been at the front of a long line of buyers.\n\nBut D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria thinks that's exactly why Nvidia shares will be heading lower. In a recent report, Luria explains that those big technology companies will soon be shifting spending to grow the production of in-house AI-related hardware. Luria believes that will lead to a \"significant cyclical downturn by 2026\" for Nvidia.\n\nThat thinking has D.A. Davidson expecting Nvidia shares to drop to $620 per share. That would represent a decline of nearly 30% from Monday's closing price. But investors should take that prediction in a larger context, too. Nvidia isn't just an AI chip company. And it could grow revenue in the coming years from its other segments, including autonomous driving technologies.\n\nNvidia's stock run certainly has been far and fast. Yet even with that price target prediction, Luria has kept a \"hold\" rating on the shares. For long-term investors, that's probably the prudent thing to do. A continued decline in the shares could even provide a good opportunity to own more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Intel Unveils New AI Accelerator in Bid to Challenge Nvidia",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. is rolling out a new version of its artificial intelligence chip, aiming to challenge Nvidia Corp. in one of the fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrumpism Is Emptying Churches Iran’s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Blackstone Nears Buyout of Skin-Care Company L’Occitane Ukraine Says It’s Behind Blaze on Russian Warship in Baltic Sea Why India’s South Rejects Modi — And Why It Matters\n\nThe updated processor, called Gaudi 3, will be widely available in the third quarter, Intel said at a company event early Tuesday. The chip is designed to boost performance in two key areas: helping train AI systems — a process that involves bombarding them with data — and running the finished software.\n\nBooming demand for AI services has sent tech companies scrambling for these so-called accelerator chips, but Nvidia has seen most of the benefit. Earlier versions of Gaudi failed to achieve the market share gains that Intel had been hoping for, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has said. He expects the new model to have a bigger impact.\n\nIntel shares gained 1.4% to $38.50 as of 11:58 a.m. in New York on Tuesday, reversing an earlier decline. They had been down 24% this year through Monday’s close.\n\nChallenging Nvidia won’t be easy. The runaway success of that company’s H100 accelerator helped more than double revenue and sent its market valuation over $2 trillion. And now Nvidia is looking to build on its lead with a just-announced chip platform called Blackwell. Systems based on that product will be available later this year, the company said in March.\n\nRead More: Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nAccording to Intel’s assessment, Gaudi 3 will be faster and more power-efficient than the H100. It will train certain types of AI models 1.7 times more quickly and be 1.5 times better at running the software, the chipmaker claims. The product will be roughly equal with Nvidia’s newer H200, Intel said, performing slightly better in some areas and a bit behind in others.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, said it can’t provide comparisons with Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell line until those products are publicly available. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — its longtime competitor in personal computer processors — also is pushing into the field. It unveiled an accelerator lineup called MI300 in December.\n\nIntel’s Gelsinger has said that he’s not just trying to catch up with Nvidia. He expects AI to bring a bigger windfall for the industry — especially as the technology spreads beyond its current concentration in the data centers of companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Personal computers, mobile phones and networking gear will require chips that are able to handle AI tasks and provide users with instantaneous feedback — something that’s not always possible with remote server farms.\n\nWhen Intel announced its fourth-quarter results in late January, Gelsinger said he was increasing the supply of Gaudi to meet growing orders and that the company has a “pipeline” for 2024 of “above $2 billion and growing.” The broader market for corporate spending on generative AI gear will increase from $40 billion in 2024 to $151 billion in 2027, Intel said, citing market research.\n\nBut that just underscores how much of a lead Nvidia has. The company had data center revenue of more than $47 billion during the 12 months ended in January. In its current fiscal year, that total will top $95 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.\n\n(Updates with shares in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "7 Mega-Cap Stocks Poised to Double Your Money in 3 Years",
        "content": "Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they’ve been responsible for the lion’s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So,  a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies.\n\nThe other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability.\n\nThose are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let’s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it’s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.\n\nThe logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD’s price, which was roughly $130 at that time.\n\nThat would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let’s start by running through that quickly.\n\nAnalysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let’s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026  and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML’s products and their relation to current trends. It’s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.\n\nASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it’s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,  is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here.\n\nNow is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That’s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected.\n\nThe result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I’d argue that it’s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That’s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There’s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  stock at the moment. there’s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it’s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.\n\nDon’t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk’s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting.\n\nBeyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won’t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future.\n\nHowever, it isn’t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its strong growth, it’s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here.\n\nLet’s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.\n\nNvidia’s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious.\n\nMore likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nCould Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?  The answer is a resounding: “Yes!”\n\nToyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company’s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It’s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data.\n\nThat got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn’t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.\n\nAs the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company’s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That’s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering.\n\nIn any case, it’s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let’s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba’s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43.\n\nIt doesn’t seem likely that it’ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba’s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it’s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Intel reveals details of new AI chip to fight Nvidia dominance",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel detailed a new version of its artificial intelligence chip at its Vision event on Tuesday that takes aim at Nvidia's dominance in semiconductors that power AI.\n\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\n\nTech companies are hunting for an alternative source of the scarce chips that are needed for AI. Intel said that its new Gaudi 3 chip was capable of training a specific large language models 50% more quickly than Nvidia's prior generation H100 processor. It is also capable for computing generative AI responses, a process called inference, more quickly than the H100 chips for some of the models Intel tested.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"Our customers, first and foremost, are asking for choice in the industry,\" said Intel vice president, strategy and product management Jeni Barovian. \"They are coming to us and they are expecting that Intel, as a computing leader, will follow the wave of (generative AI) and deliver solutions that meet their needs. And they are looking for an open approach.\"\n\nCONTEXT\n\nIntel and Advanced Micro Devices have struggled to produce a compelling bundle of chips and the software necessary to build AI applications that can become a viable alternative to Nvidia. Nvidia controlled roughly 83% of the data center chip market in 2023, with a majority of the remaining 17% share held by Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that it does not sell directly.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nIntel used Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's 5nm process to build the chips. Gaudi 3 includes two main processor chips fused together, and is more than twice as fast as its predecessor. The chip is designed to be strung together with thousands of others and when done so can generate an enormous amount of compute power.\n\nWHAT IS NEXT\n\nThe Gaudi 3 chip will be available to server builders such as Supermicro and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the second quarter of this year.\n\nThe next generation of Gaudi chips will be code named Falcon Shores.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Intel's latest AI chip is a direct shot at Nvidia's moneymaker",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) on Tuesday debuted a new AI chip designed to take on one of Nvidia’s (NVDA) most popular AI processors as part of its Intel Vision event.\n\nThe company's Gaudi 3 chip matches and exceeds Nvidia’s H100 AI processorwhen it comes to training and deploying generative AI models. The H100 is one of Nvidia's most popular chips, powering artificial intelligence applications for some of the world's biggest tech companies, from Microsoft to Google.\n\nAccording to Intel, the Gaudi 3 is 40% more power efficient with 50% faster inferencing than Nvidia’s H100. Training refers to the time it takes to train an AI foundation model like OpenAI’s GPT-3, while inferencing is the process of actually using the models for apps.\n\nIntel says the Gaudi 3 is up to 1.7 times faster when training common large language models than the H100. Intel even says its chip is an average of 1.3 times faster than Nvidia’s beefier Nvidia H200 when it comes to inferencing certain language models.\n\nIn addition to the Gaudi line of chips and Xeon CPUs, Intel is also marketing so-called AI PCs, computers equipped with neural processing units that can handle onboard AI tasks.\n\nThese AI maneuvers come at a critical time for Intel.\n\nThe company is working to reinvent itself as the leader in sophisticated chip technology while building out its chip manufacturing capabilities in the US and abroad. This includes a foundry business that will build Intel’s own chips as well as those for third-party customers. The company has already confirmed it will build chips for Microsoft.\n\nBut this reinvention is coming at a steep cost, with Intel announcing earlier this month a $7 billion operating loss for 2023 as part of its new financial reporting structure. Intel stock is down 25% so far this year. Rivals Nvidia and AMD (AMD), conversely, are up 15% and 74% so far this year, respectively.\n\nIntel has been teasing the Gaudi 3 chip for some time, with CEO Pat Gelsinger showing off a version of the platform during a December press event. It’s seen as Intel’s best chance yet to compete with Nvidia in the AI market, a space the graphics chip giant dominates thanks to its powerful hardware and software.\n\nStory continues Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger discusses his company's plans to capitalize on the booming demand for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence during a conference in San Jose, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024. (Michael Liedtke/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company's new chips also come just a month after Nvidia debuted its own next-generation AI platform called Blackwell. That system includes Nvidia’s B200 AI chip, which is made up of two Blackwell chips mated together to act as a single processor.\n\nIntel is putting its AI systems forward as an alternative to Nvidia’s offerings, claiming an open-source approach that will allow customers to use the services and software that they want.\n\nAnd while Nvidia is the leader in overall AI technology, Intel is betting enterprises will remain wary of sticking with a single source for high-value needs like AI hardware.\n\nFor instance, hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others already either offer their own AI chips or are developing them in addition to using Nvidia’s chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIntel’s Gaudi 3 will give those hyperscalers another option in the chip market.\n\nIntel also announced on Tuesday a new form of Ethernet connectivity for Gaudi 3 nodes, competing with Nvidia’s InfiniBand connectivity technology to ensure uninterrupted connections and processing. The company also debuted its Xeon 6 processors for use in AI systems.\n\nTaking a page out of Nvidia’s book, Intel is offering the entire setup as a reference design that partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro can use to build their own server cabinets.\n\nIntel says customers will be able to order the Gaudi 3-powered systems in sizes ranging from individual nodes and small boxes to enormous megaclusters that can fill entire data centers.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best biotech ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the biotech industry, head over to 5 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy.\n\nThe new era in biotech is defined by the convergence of biology, data, and artificial intelligence. According to The Journal of mHealth, the focus is shifting towards enabling technologies like connected instruments, cloud-based applications, and AI tools, essential for understanding and engineering biology effectively. However, biotech faces unique challenges compared to traditional tech, including acquiring large-scale, standardized, and costly data necessary for AI/ML applications. Despite slower progress, AI/ML holds significant promise in revolutionizing therapeutics beyond discovery. Additionally, AI bots are increasingly assisting scientists in tasks like experimental planning and data analysis, which is transforming workflows. The biopharma industry is experiencing a surge in novel drug approvals, particularly in advanced modalities, signaling a strategic shift and the need for adaptable research tools and collaborative approaches. Moreover, community-driven initiatives are reshaping the biotech landscape, fostering knowledge sharing, attracting diverse talent, and driving digital transformation efforts.\n\nThe biotech industry is witnessing increased interest in leveraging AI technologies, with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently making announcements regarding partnerships with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to utilize generative AI in surgery and with GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) to enhance medical imaging. Raj Joshi, a technology analyst and senior vice president at Moody’s Ratings, highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s pivotal role in providing essential technology for tasks previously difficult to achieve or requiring significantly more time and resources. He emphasized the potential of healthcare, including biotechnology, chemicals, and drug discovery, as a robust area for Nvidia's growth. According to EY, about 41% of biotech CEOs expressed concrete interest in leveraging generative AI for their companies, indicating a rapid adoption of AI technologies in the industry. This eagerness to integrate AI into biotech operations is unprecedented, as per industry experts. Arda Ural, EY Americas health and life sciences industry market leader, commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Over the last 18 months or so, we tend to believe it is more hope than hype because of the tangible outcomes and then the very compelling use cases of how AI helped with the pharmaceutical industry, medtech industry or biotech industry.”\n\nGlobalData'ssurvey on the biopharmaceutical industry in 2024 indicates a significant level of optimism among healthcare professionals regarding the recovery of biotech funding this year. This follows a decline in private biotech venture financing in 2022 and 2023, attributed to macroeconomic factors. Currently, 607 venture-backed companies based in the US are impacted by the funding crunch, with more than 1500 drugs on the line, including those in preclinical stages. A considerable proportion of these companies have not raised any capital in the past few years. In 2021, venture financing for US-based companies with innovator drugs reached its peak, leading to many early-stage biotechs going public with inflated valuations. However, this resulted in overvalued biotechs failing to meet milestones, leading to a decline in investor confidence and selectivity in new investments. Biotechs are now exploring alternative funding sources, with 39% of survey respondents preferring enhanced industry partnerships as an effective measure to mitigate funding downturns. In the APAC region, respondents preferred government incentives or grants over private VC investors compared to North America and Europe. In the US, NIH grant funding to private companies saw a notable increase from 2021 to 2022, highlighting its significance in bridging the investment gap from venture capitals. Following a decline from record highs in 2021, venture capital funding has shown resilience in recent years, and signs now indicate a potential return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nTo benefit from the growth potential in the biotech space, investors can invest in ETFs that expose them to top industry stocks like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN).

SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 2: 0.05%\n\nSPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index before fees and expenses. It offers exposure to the biotechnology sector of the S&P Total Market Index. The ETF provides diversified exposure across large, mid, and small-cap stocks within the biotechnology sector. It is one of the best biotech ETFs. As of April 1, 2024, SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) held $7,492.98 million in assets under management, and featured a gross expense ratio of 0.35%.

Exact Sciences is a leading provider of diagnostic testing and maker of the noninvasive colorectal cancer screening test Cologuard®. The stock was a top performer through the first half of the year but pulled back in Q3. The company reported strong financial results as 31% growth in screening revenues (mostly Cologuard®) drove an overall 19% revenue increase. However, screening revenues fell slightly short of elevated expectations and were not good enough to support the stock’s year-to-date outperformance. We continue to be bullish on Cologuard’s® long-term growth potential; the addressable market expanded significantly in 2021 when the United States Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screenings to 45 from 50. Our research indicates the lowered screening age expands the company’s addressable market by ~18 million unscreened individuals. We also believe meaningful long[1]term opportunities exist as the company develops additional high-value cancer tests.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:GILD), same as the prior quarter.\n\nLike Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is one of the top biotech plays to consider.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):\n\n“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Retail ETFs To Buy 11 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever 15 Countries with Highest Percentage of Millionaires in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "7 Cheap Stocks on the Verge of Explosive Gains",
        "content": "Even as rates remain elevated and economic conditions seem sour, finding cheap stocks to buy isn’t as easy as it was just a year ago. Looking forward to another cheap debt era, alongside unique tech trends and other sector-specific tailwinds, many of the most popular stocks are pricy from both a valuation and per-share pricing perspective.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t diamonds in the rough. These cheap stocks trade at low multiples and per-share pricing, but with a catch: each tends toward the speculative, with long-term prospects demanding patience as trends and tech matures. If you’re willing to wait, though, these cheap stocks to buy represent some of the few remaining deals on the market.\n\nindie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) AI. Circuit board. Technology background.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor stocks may have surged over the past year, but that doesn’t mean the sector lacks its own slate of cheap stocks. Even as giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) face overvaluation, investors are increasingly uncovering small-cap and cheap semiconductor stocks in search of the next significant breakthrough. Among these, indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI) stands out with its robust offerings tailored for the automotive and autonomous driving sectors, meeting the rising demand for cutting-edge car technologies, including driver assistance and enhanced infotainment systems.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn 2023, indie Semiconductor shattered records by doubling its revenue to $223.2 million. Furthermore, the company’s profit margins impressively reached 52.5%, marking an increase of more than 2.5% from the previous year. This margin growth demonstrates indie Semiconductor’s ability to excel amid changing economic landscapes by enhancing efficiencies and reducing costs without compromising quality. Though not yet profitable, its low debt load and slim 4x price-to-sales ratio make it a standout play among cheap semiconductor stocks – a sector that’s increasingly shrinking today.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there’s any reliable quality indicator for cheap stocks to buy, it’s a Warren Buffett endorsement. And with Buffett snagging as much Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) stock as he can, this cheap satellite radio stock may be preparing for takeoff. Throughout Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) last few financial periods, Buffett and team focused primarily on selling stocks rather than bargain hunting new buys – with a few exceptions, including Sirius.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett values Sirius XM not just for potential corporate restructuring but as a solid value investment in its own right. Trading at low multiples, Sirius XM’s sales are steady and reliable (if not spectacular). The company boasts over 30% EBITDA margins for four consecutive years and free cash flow surpassing $1 billion in the same period. Additionally, Sirius XM offers an appealing 4.69% dividend yield with a 31% payout ratio, showcasing the company’s adept cash management that still takes reinvested earnings and growth into account.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Symbotic (SYM) Short-Squeeze Stocks\n\nCheap robotics and automation stock Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is revolutionizing how major corporations, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), handle their warehouse operations. The company uses AI to streamline warehouse robotics platforms, enabling quicker and more efficient selection, packing, and shipping of goods than traditional methods. This enhances safety and saves significant cash. While currently serving high-profile brands, Symbotic’s strategic shift towards broader accessibility could skyrocket the value of this robotics stock.\n\nSymbotic is crafting a strategy to extend warehouse automation and robotics to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack the resources to implement the efficiencies that giants like Walmart and Target enjoy. By focusing on multi-user warehouse complexes and integrating these services into the buildings as part of a leasing incentive rather than direct sales to SMBs, Symbotic is looking to capture a vast, largely untapped SMB market. Although big-name brands currently represent a major revenue source, tapping into the SMB sector could generate a continuous revenue stream for Symbotic, positioning the company for sustained financial success – meaning its cheap stock status likely won’t last.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) Homepage of Rocket lab (RKLB). Official website of company\n\nSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA’s (NASDAQ:RKLB) recent stock dilution unsettled retail investors, but a temporary dip in share price shouldn’t deter you from the cheap stock’s significant long-term potential. Last year, Rocket Lab set records with unprecedented launch stats and secured a $515 million contract to construct and maintain 18 space vehicles for the U.S. government.\n\nThe company’s impressive performance in 2023 shines through in its end-of-year report despite annual per-share losses of $0.38 falling short of analyst projections. It’s important to note that Rocket Lab, while not in the pre-revenue stage, is a burgeoning entity in the high-stakes realm of space exploration, trading current losses for the prospect of a tenfold increase in value.\n\nThis growth potential is clear from Rocket Lab’s existing backlog or customer order tally, which more than doubled in 2023, reaching $1.04 billion, up from $582.4 million in 2022. Although immediate conversion of orders into profits isn’t feasible, the company’s substantial backlog provides a glimpse into its future cash flow. Rocket Lab anticipates recognizing nearly half of this total backlog as revenue within the next 12 months, potentially mitigating the impact of recent stock dilution in the short term.\n\nChegg Inc (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at just 6.5x earnings and 0.78x value, Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) stands out from other cheap stocks based on its current (under) valuation and its long-term growth trajectory that many Wall Street players are seemingly ignoring. This year, traditional learning institutions, including some of the most prestigious ones, faced increasing scrutiny and skepticism. I think artificial intelligence and the varied tech arising from increased remote work trends will trigger massive sea changes in how we go about education, with Chegg as one of the few recognizing the sector’s latent strength.\n\nChegg is incorporating AI into various learning tools, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 taking center stage. This innovation stands out as one of the EdTech sector’s most successful, if not the sole, applications of such advanced AI tools.\n\nOf course, pioneering next-generation tools often come with high costs and unpredictability at the start of their lifecycle. While past ZIRP-era stocks may have overcome the cash crunch on sentiment and momentum alone, Chegg hasn’t been quite as lucky. Consequently, Chegg’s shares have fallen over 35% since the beginning of 2024, following an earnings report that fell short of expectations alongside a conservative outlook. Nevertheless, Chegg’s management has framed this downturn as part of the R&D process for AI in EdTech, describing the development as “ongoing and iterative.” They have cautioned that it’s too early to forecast a timeline for revenue and margin recovery due to R&D expenses. Still, at a low relative valuation and cheap stock status, Chegg is a moderate value play coupled with a long-term growth thesis.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Valley National Bancorp (VLY) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs Fed rate cuts slowly materialize, banking stocks will go one of two ways: companies with limited debt or the size to manage it, like the legacy mega-banks, will likely see shares tick downward a net interest income dries up. On the other hand, smaller regional banks with higher relative leverage and local real estate lending operations will finally be somewhat freed from oppressive borrowing rates and reduced consumer loan interest. And few regional banks stand out as quality cheap stocks as Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY).\n\nValley National’s stock trades at a bottom-barrel 0.6x book value and 7x earnings, marking it as both undervalued and frequently overlooked. Its strong balance sheet and low debt load, evidenced by a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56 compared to the industry average of 1.2, highlight the bank’s relative lack of leverage compared to competitors. The bank’s recent stock buyback initiative and a 5.97% trailing dividend yield further affirm its financial health.\n\nAnalysts generally regard Valley National as undervalued, with an average price target of $9.50 — about 25% above its present share price. Beyond the bullish outlook, broad sentiment surrounding the bank stock is on an uptick as 56% of analysts now recommend investors “hold” Valley National, a massive improvement from the 50% who advised selling in the previous evaluation period.\n\nSamsara (IOT) Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a \"BUY NOW!\" button on a laptop keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe term “Internet of Things” concept often evokes images of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems, but these consumer-facing examples barely scratch the surface of the broader IoT sector. Cheap stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is near the top of the wider IoT sector, expanding the IoT concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations better. The company focuses on fleets, transportation, and heavy equipment, aiming to streamline operational workflows, enhance movement tracking, and improve safety overall.\n\nIn its most recent report, Samsara celebrated a milestone year, achieving a 39% year-over-year increase in recurring revenue. The company also saw its recurring customer base grow by 49%, generating a solid $27 million in free cash flow. As a relatively young company introducing cutting-edge technology, Samsara’s growth potential is untapped and unlimited. And, as both the company and tech mature, Samsara is set to snag greater market penetration as legacy businesses turn to new tech; management aims to expand its operational reach by targeting larger clients that are currently just beyond its grasp.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget FAANG and the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- These \"AI Five\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "When a group of stocks regularly outperforms the broader market, Wall Street analysts like to bundle them together so it's easy for investors to separate them from the rest of the pack. In 2017, CNBC financial analyst Jim Cramer coined the FAANG acronym to describe five of the largest technology companies at the time:\n\nFacebook, which now trades as Meta Platforms Apple  Amazon  Netflix  Google, which now trades as Alphabet\n\nIn 2023, Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett identified a new group of stocks and named them the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Those stocks delivered an average return of 112% last year, which crushed the 24% gain in the S&P 500 index. The Magnificent Seven includes:\n\nMeta Platforms Apple Amazon Alphabet Microsoft  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Tesla Image source: Nvidia.\n\n2024 might be dominated by the \"AI Five\"\n\nDespite most of the Magnificent Seven heading higher so far in 2024, Tesla stock trades down by 33% and Apple is down by 8% so far. It prompted one analyst -- Glen Kacher from Light Street Capital -- to rethink the stock market's leadership altogether.\n\nConsidering artificial intelligence (AI) is such a dominant theme among the market's top-performing stocks, Kacher has identified five companies operating at the forefront of the fast-growing industry. He calls them the \"AI Five:\"\n\nNvidia Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) Advanced Micro Devices Broadcom  Microsoft\n\nHere's why two stocks in that group are a buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia opened 2023 with a market capitalization of around $360 billion. It added $1.8 trillion to that figure in the 16 months since, making it the third-largest company in the world as measured by market cap behind Microsoft and Apple. It's all thanks to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the most sought-after in the industry for handling AI workloads.\n\nThe H100 GPU sent Nvidia's data center revenue soaring 217% year over year in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) to $47.5 billion. Now, the company is ramping up shipments of its new H200, which provides up to twice the inferencing speed while consuming half the amount of energy of its predecessor. Inferencing is the process of feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions, leading to faster and more accurate outputs for the end user.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are at the top of most data center operators' wish lists, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Social media giant Meta Platforms even agreed to buy 350,000 H100 chips in the coming year (with an estimated price tag of $9 billion) to train its Llama large language models (LLMs). The only thing that stopped Nvidia's revenue from growing even faster last year was a lack of supply; it simply couldn't keep up with the unprecedented demand.\n\nInvestors' attention has already turned to Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which was unveiled in March. A GPU called the B200 will start shipping next year, and it will come in a DGX configuration that links eight of them together to provide 3 times faster training performance and 15 times faster inferencing speed than the equivalent DGX H100 setup. In other words, it will allow developers to bring their AI applications to market substantially faster.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $24.44 in earnings per share during fiscal 2025 (which began in February), marking an 88% increase from fiscal 2024. Based on Nvidia's current stock price of $880.08, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.\n\nThat's a 20% premium to the current 30.1 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100, but Nvidia's blistering growth means its stock could look cheap by the end of the fiscal year. However, investors who wait until then might find they've missed the boat -- as has been the case for the past year.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)\n\nTSMC is one of the most important companies on the planet right now. It manufactures more than half of the world's chips, including those for data centers, smartphones, cars, and general consumer electronics. Most importantly, TSM is the go-to manufacturer for leading semiconductor designers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nTSMC's revenue sank by 8.7% year over year in 2023 to $69.3 billion. Many end markets were grappling with supply gluts that began in 2022, when rising inflation and interest rates prompted consumers to trim their spending on big-ticket electronics. But things began to turn in the fourth quarter, because while revenue was down 1.5% year over year, it was up 13.6% sequentially.\n\nThat included growth of 17% in the high-performance computing (HPC) segment and 27% growth in the smartphone segment. The HPC result was driven by strong demand for AI-related data center chips, and the smartphone result was partly attributable to Apple's latest 3-nanometer A17 Pro chip.\n\nThe HPC segment accounted for 43% of TSMC's total revenue in 2023, and that figure consistently increases each year as tech giants race to fill their data centers with AI chips. In fact, the company expects HPC to be the fastest growing piece of its entire business this year, which means it will represent an even larger share of total revenue.\n\nBut smartphones will also be an important source of long-term demand as AI processing migrates from the data center to the device. Apple's A17 Pro chip was the first to utilize TSMC's 3-nanometer fabrication process, and it's designed to speed up AI workloads in applications like the Siri voice assistant on the iPhone. Plus, Apple is currently negotiating with companies like Alphabet and OpenAI to determine which AI chatbot will be installed on future models of the iPhone by default.\n\nRunning those models on-device will require complex chips capable of delivering significantly more processing power, and that's good news for TSMC.\n\nTSMC estimates its revenue will grow by more than 20% in 2024, sharply reversing the decline in 2023. Wall Street thinks it will grow by another 20% in 2025 to top $100 billion for the first time. Here's the best part: Based on TSMC's $5.18 in 2023 earnings per share, its stock trades at a P/E ratio of just 27.2, which is substantially cheaper than both Nvidia and the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "No next-big-thing investment trend has arguably been hotter since the advent of the internet than artificial intelligence (AI) is right now.\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm referring to software and systems handling tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. Machine learning gives software and systems the ability to learn and evolve without human intervention, which can make these systems more proficient at their tasks over time.\n\nThe utility of AI can't be overstated enough. Almost every sector and industry can benefit from its use, which is probably why the analysts at PwC believe artificial intelligence will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile most institutional money managers and Wall Street analysts view AI and the companies deploying AI infrastructure and software favorably, this bullishness isn't universal. Based on the low-water price targets issued by a select group of Wall Street analysts, the following five AI stocks could plunge by as much as 86%!\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 30%\n\nThe first AI stock that could tumble after a monstrous run higher is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In February, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria raised his and his firms' price target on Nvidia to $620 from $410. Despite this epic increase, it implies that the third-largest public company by market cap in the U.S. will shed 30% of its value, based on where it closed on April 5.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the overwhelming top choice of businesses for AI-accelerated data centers, there are plenty of reasons to be believe Nvidia stock could be in a bubble.\n\nTo start with, Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise about 40% of its sales, are all developing AI GPUs of their own. Even if these companies continue to rely on Nvidia's GPUs as complements to their in-house GPUs, future orders from these industry leaders would be expected to decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo add to the above, Nvidia's pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs is expected to take a hit in the latter-half of 2024. The lion's share of its 217% increase in data center sales in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) was driven by GPU scarcity. As new competitors enter the arena and Nvidia ramps up its own production, GPU scarcity will diminish -- as will the company's pricing power.\n\nFurther, every next-big-thing trend over the last 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. Suffice it to say, I fully expect Luria's price target to be hit.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 74%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that could plummet in the not-too-distant future if one Wall Street analyst is correct is server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Senior equity research analyst Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna stood firm on his price target of $250 for Super Micro just two months earlier in an interview on CNBC. This would imply Super Micro Computer losing almost three-quarters of its current value.\n\nIt's understandable why investors have gone head over heels for Super Micro. The company incorporates Nvidia's top-tier GPUs in its energy-efficient and highly customizable rack servers that are utilized in AI-accelerated data centers. Sales for the company are expected to double in 2024 to north of $14 billion.\n\nHowever, we've been here before with Super Micro. It was expected to be a prime beneficiary of the cloud-computing revolution in the late 2010s, but failed to maintain its sales momentum. This speaks to the fact that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new trends and innovations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer also finds itself at the mercy of Nvidia. If the latter continues to deal with supply issues/scarcity for its GPUs, Super Micro will fail to realize its full potential.\n\nWhile a retracement to $250 may not be in the cards anytime soon, Super Micro Computer definitely has a lot to prove after its stock appreciated by 767% over the trailing year. A Tesla Model S charging. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nThe potential disaster du jour among AI stocks is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). CEO and founder Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research believes Tesla will retrace to $23.53 per share, which would represent 86% downside from where it closed on April 5.\n\nOn one hand, Tesla has made history by becoming the first automotive company to build itself from the ground up to mass production in well over a half-century. It's also the only EV pure-play that's generating a recurring profit (four consecutive years, as of the end of 2023).\n\nAt the same time, Tesla is encountering game-changing challenges as EV demand tapers off. The company slashed the sales price of its four production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023. The end result has been a more-than-halving in Tesla's operating margin since the end of September 2022 (17.2% to 8.2%, as of Dec. 31, 2023).\n\nPerhaps an even bigger issue is that Tesla has failed to become more than just a car company. Its Energy Generation and Storage segment sales have stagnated in recent quarters, while Services is generating a low-single-digit gross margin. I'll add that solar has been a money-loser since SolarCity was acquired in 2016.\n\nDespite being nothing more than a car company, Tesla is valued at nearly 60 times forecast earnings in 2024. With most auto stocks trading in a range of 6 to 8 times expected earnings per share (EPS), there's definite reason to believe Tesla stock will head lower.\n\nMicroStrategy: Implied downside of 85%\n\nA fourth artificial intelligence stock that could get absolutely crushed if the most-bearish Wall Street analyst proves accurate is enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). Last August, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill defended his firms' lowball price target of $210 for MicroStrategy, which would imply a decline of 85% from where shares closed this past week.\n\nOne issue for MicroStrategy is that its AI-driven enterprise analytics software division stopped growing 10 years ago. Sales have fallen by an aggregate of 14% since peaking.\n\nBut let's face the facts: MicroStrategy is best-known for CEO Michael Saylor's strategy of issuing convertible debt and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. On March 19, Saylor made a post on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) that noted his company held 214,246 Bitcoin -- more than 1% of the eventual supply -- at an average price of roughly $35,160 per token.\n\nWith each Bitcoin valued at $67,600, as of the time of this writing, MicroStrategy's crypto stake is worth $14.5 billion. However, the company's market cap currently stands at $24.4 billion. Accounting for the company's modestly profitable (but non-growing) software business, as well as its growing debt pile, MicroStrategy is trading at around a 70% premium to the Bitcoin it holds.\n\nIf investors want to buy Bitcoin, a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a direct purchase of the cryptocurrency on an exchange would be a considerably smarter move than buying into MicroStrategy, whose premium valuation to the current price of Bitcoin makes no sense.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 78%\n\nThe fifth AI stock that could plunge, according to the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Analyst Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital doesn't believe Palantir's Commercial segment margins can continue expanding at their current pace. This compelled Jaluria to recently reiterate his and his firms' $5 price target on Palantir, which implies 78% downside.\n\nThere's no question Palantir's stock is pricey. The company's nearly $51 billion market cap is closing in on a multiple of 19 times forecast sales this year. It's also valued at 70 times consensus EPS in 2024 despite slowing sales growth.\n\nBut one thing Palantir has working for it that merits a hefty premium is its irreplaceability. No company at scale comes anywhere close to the solutions it can provide. Palantir's AI-driven Gotham platform helps governments cull data and plan military operations. The contracts Palantir wins from the U.S. government tend to span multiple years and generate highly predictable cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, its Foundry platform is just getting off the ground and helping businesses make sense of their data so they can streamline their operations. Whereas a sales ceiling exists with Gotham -- i.e., Palantir won't offer access to its platform to certain countries (e.g., China) -- Foundry has a theoretical growth runway that stretches decades into the future.\n\nThough it could take some time for Palantir to grow into its current valuation, I don't anticipate Jaluria's low-water price target being hit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best penny stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nThe markets were off to an impressive start in 2024, driven by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will embark on interest rate cuts. However, data is now showing that inflation remains sticky and the labor market tight, causing new concerns regarding the Fed's possible path towards rate cuts. In this environment it makes sense to look towards masters of the money game.\n\nKen Griffin is one of the hedge fund managers well-positioned to benefit from the ever-evolving financial landscape. The mastermind behind Citadel Investment Group, which he founded in 1990 with $4.2 million, continues to experience a surge in success. The legendary investor set a record with a remarkable return of 153% in 2022 as he got everything right with his strategic bets on inflation and interest rates.\n\nWith a portfolio value of over $460 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street's most tracked hedge funds, consistently surpassing 25% annual returns since 2016. While the hedge fund operates several portfolio funds, its lead fund is Wellington, which invests in various asset classes and sectors as part of its diversification strategy.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin’s flagship Wellington fund delivered 38% returns above the 26% returns that it delivered in 2021, upon topping the 24% gain in 2020. The fund was also up 19.4% in 2019, more than double the 9.1% gain in 2018.\n\nGriffin's hedge fund deploys a multi-strategy investing method that allows it to take advantage of long and short-term investment opportunities. In 2023, when the hedge fund industry came under immense pressure and ended up averaging a 4.4% gain, Citadel outperformed the entire industry, delivering solid returns of 15.3%.\n\nThe flagship fund had an excellent start to 2024, achieving a 1.9% increase in the first month as all employed strategies across commodities, equities, fixed income, credit, and quantitative sectors yielded positive results. Griffin expects the momentum to continue throughout the year as he remains bullish about the US economy amid the expected interest rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Federal Reserve can start cutting rates this summer, and we will see unemployment increase slightly. But the overall economy looks pretty damn good right now,” Griffin said at the MFA Network event in Miami. “This is a real change in mindset from where we were September, October last year.”\n\nCitadel Group generated a profit of $7 billion in 2023. Nevertheless, it was an underperformance, considering a 38% profit jump in 2022 to $16 billion. Similarly, Citadel Investment Group has kept its tradition of returning significant value to shareholders. It has returned over $25 billion since 2018.\n\nGriffin's impressive performance in the market has everything to do with his focus on large-cap, high-growth stocks. Citadel Investment Group boasts significant holding in the magnificent 7 stocks led by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stocks posted double-digit gains in 2023.\n\nAmid the aggressive investment style focusing on high-growth technology stocks, Griffin is also a value investor who often looks for opportunities in small-cap and penny stocks. With a net worth of $35 billion, the billionaire investor employs 18,000 people to scan the best high-risk reward opportunities. 13 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned billionaire Griffin's portfolio and picked 13 penny stocks he's holding. We also checked price targets of these stocks set by Wall Street analysts and mentioned upside potential of these equities based on these targets. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

In December, they announced a debt exchange offering, exchanging the 2025 notes for 2027 notes with a higher interest rate while repaying ~$100m of the balance.

        "title": "Shareholder Meetings in Focus as Earnings Season Begins",
        "content": "Companies have faced a range of challenges over the past two-plus years. Following the 2021 boom driven by intense fiscal and monetary stimulus, along with the subsequent dramatic rise in interest rates throughout 2022, last year was tough at the macro level as corporate profit growth stalled. But the fourth-quarter reporting season underscored just how strong large multinational companies are in producing cash flow and rewarding shareholders.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with STLA.\n\nAccording to Factset, a third-straight quarter of earnings per share growth is the current forecast among S&P 500 companies.[1] We'll know a whole lot more beginning this Friday when the big banks begin posting first-quarter results. Investors will also be curious about dividend and buyback plans now that the earnings recession is clearly in the rearview mirror. Furthermore, capital markets may be turning the corner with a few decent IPOs in recent weeks and M&A activity showing vital signs in some industries.\n\nWhy shareholder meetings matter\n\nClues on all these areas are commonly provided at shareholder meetings. At annual events, stockholders vote on important company decisions such as electing board members (we saw the drama on that front last week with Disney (NYSE:DIS)), approving M&A actions and other corporate moves.\n\nShareholder meetings offer a platform for management teams to hear from equity owners big and small while relaying operations plans to the market. The gatherings can become tense, though, when activist investors assert themselves. Enhanced stock price volatility can also come about when major strategy shifts are announced unexpectedly or if surprising financial details are presented.\n\nGather round\n\nThe April through June stretch is the peak season for shareholder meetings. Let's shed light on some of the most notable events that could move individual stocks and drive industry price action. There's even a sweet treat at the end.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobal Shareholder Meetings by Month (2022-2024) Shareholder Meetings in Focus as Earnings Season Begins\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nApril 16: Stellantis (NYSE:STLA)\n\nThe auto OEM space is in flux. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported very weak March EV numbers and a tepid outlook while Ford (NYSE:F) posted solid year-on-year hybrid sales.[2] Investors may get a glimpse of how the situation has unfolded at Stellantis after a tumultuous second half of 2023 recall last year's labor strikes and an eventual agreement reached between workers and management. Then in March, Stellantis reported that it will cut 400 tech jobs, so all may not be so well with the U.S. automaker.[3] Looking ahead, rival Ford's shareholder meeting is slated for May 9.\n\nApril 22: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nPowering markets higher last year and during the early part of 2023 was the semiconductor area. Broadcom is seen as the little sibling of sorts to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but the former's 100%-plus return over the past 12 months is no sleeper among momentum traders. The AI infrastructure buildout player's shareholder meeting could provide further details about the chip industry's growth trajectory. The company's second-quarter earnings release doesn't come until June 12.\n\nApril 24: ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nKeeping on the semiconductor theme, the third-largest non-U.S. stock hosts its shareholder meeting just two days after Broadcom's.[4] The Dutch company, part of Goldman's vaunted GRANOLAS trade, is also a beneficiary of the AI boom.[5] Strong EPS growth is expected this year, but shares trade at a lofty forward earnings multiple.[6] Any financial updates presented could move the stock as well as European equity ETFs.\n\nApril 24: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)\n\nBroadening out, Bank of America's shareholder event comes just eight days after the release of its first-quarter profit report. CEO Brian Moynihan has navigated volatile financial and capital markets okay, but the bank's one-year stock performance pales in comparison to peer JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM). Be on the lookout for comments about consumer spending and risk appetite among institutions at the event. Money Center banks would benefit from more active capital markets as the year unfolds, so say analysts at Morgan Stanley, but much uncertainty remains.[7]\n\nApril 30: Citigroup (NYSE:C)\n\nCiti's shareholder gathering takes place the following Tuesday after its April 12 first-quarter report. CEO Jane Fraser has been leading a turnaround at the $120 billion market cap bank, and the stock has responded well up 20% year to date. Last month, the industry reported improved credit card delinquencies and a decline in net charge-offs.[8] It comes as card issuers are seen being negatively impacted by a new swipe-fee agreement, potentially having a material impact on revenue.[9]\n\nMay 1: The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nSpeaking of the consumer, volatility could come about on April 30 when Coca-Cola reports first-quarter results. Its annual shareholder meeting occurs the next day on Wednesday, May 1. The stock is down fractionally in the past 12 months, no doubt hurt by the rising popularity of GLP-1 wonder drugs. But Coca-Cola hiked its dividend by more than 5% earlier this year, perhaps a sign that the Consumer Staples stalwart remains a dominant brand around the world.[10] Growth in its Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA regions helped drive a 7% year-on-year revenue jump, as reported back in February.[11]\n\nMay 4: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(BRK.B)\n\nThe most famous shareholder meeting is arguably the one hosted by the Oracle of Omaha. Woodstock for Capitalists will have a somber tone on the first Saturday in May, however. The event comes after the passing of Charlie Munger, the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Still, value investors will look forward to hearing what Buffett has to say about the state of the economy and what Berkshire plans to do with its growing cash position. First-quarter 2024 earnings are also released at the annual event.\n\nMay 6: The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY)\n\nLast but not least, this year's shareholder meeting in Hershey, Pennsylvania might capture more attention following the meteoric rise in cocoa futures in the past three months. Rising from $4,000 to above $10,000 per ton, cocoa topped copper in value last month.[12] Ironically, Hershey shares have been generally rangebound between $180 and $205 since October 2023. Hershey has an unconfirmed first-quarter 2024 earnings date of Thursday, May 2.\n\n[1] Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, March 28, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com/[2] Tesla shares drop 6% on weak auto revenue, warning of slower growth in 2024, CNBC, Lora Kolodny, Jan 24, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com/[3] Stellantis to cut 400 engineering, technology jobs, Detroit Free Press, Eric D.

        "content": "Many highly successful stock pickers, including Warren Buffett, often buy stocks on weakness. That’s largely because companies that are great or are on their way to greatness often sink for reasons that are not at all justified.\n\nFor example, on Feb. 21, Super MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) dropped to as low as $817.08 per share. Many investors wrung their hands about the stock’s valuation, even though it was not expensive, along with the firm’s decision to sell more shares of its stock. Of course, the latter decision ultimately did not greatly affect the company’s fundamentals. Anyone who bought the stock for just above $700 and sold it near its high of $1,033 on Mar. 28, a little over a month later, would have generated a profit of nearly 50% in a little over a month.\n\nSo Buffett’s belief that investors should “be fearful when others are greedy and… be greedy only when others are fearful” does work. For those who want to profit from that philosophy, here are three stocks to buy on dips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), which sells inverters used in solar energy projects, tumbled over 10% on Apr. 5 compared to its highs on the previous day. The catalyst for the downturn was reportedly the decision by Chief Commercial Officer David Ranhoff leaving the firm “for personal reasons” effective Jun. 30.\n\nBut sometimes executives really do leave firms for personal reasons, and this may be the case for Ranhoof. Moreover, it’s unlikely that Enphase will badly be hurt by the departure of its chief commercial officer. The company probably has many highly capable sales managers who can adequately fill his shoes.\n\nAnd importantly, Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) CEO Dan Shugar said in February that “solar is unstoppable” and “the intrinsic economics of utility scale are phenomenal both in the U.S. and overseas. It has never been as favorable as it is.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEnphase is reeling from the weakness of residential solar in California due to regulatory changes in the state. Also, excess inventories in Europe weigh on the stock. Those issues, though, are expected to be temporary. They should be dwarfed over the longer term by huge increases in the demand for solar energy by utilities.\n\nThese increases will be driven, as I’ve noted in the past, by significant gains in electricity demand. By the end of this year, ENPH stock should be far above its current levels as a result of the latter trend. Consequently, ENPH is one of the best stocks to buy on dips.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market has penalized Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock after the firm announced on Apr. 2 after the market closed that its manufacturing unit’s operational losses increased to $7 billion last year from $5.2 billion in 2022. Further, the unit’s revenue declined 31% to $18.9 billion. In the wake of the admittedly discouraging news, INTC stock retreated about 15% from recent highs. But CEO Pat Gelsinger explained the firm was remedying bad decisions it had made previously that weighed down the manufacturing business. What’s more, Intel expects the unit’s operating losses to peak this year. Also noteworthy is that it predicted the unit will break even on an operating basis in 2027.\n\nBut the manufacturing unit’s backlog now exceeds $15 billion, and it secured a sizeable deal from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There are also indications that INTC may soon obtain a meaningful commitment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs a result, other tech firms impressed by Intel’s ability to win deals from two of the biggest names in the sector may sign contracts as well. I predict within the next 12 months the Street will start to be enamored with Intel again as the manufacturing unit’s backlog grows.\n\nFurther, as I’ve previously noted, reviews of the company’s powerful artificial intelligence Gaudi chips have been quite favorable. The chips’ backlog reached over $2 billion by the end of last year. What’s more, the backlog is growing quite rapidly. Intel is expected to launch a greatly improved version of the chip later this year.\n\nAmerican Superconductor (AMSC) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) sells products used to regulate the flow of electricity. It serves multiple industries whose use of electricity or whose revenues are rapidly increasing.\n\nSpecifically, AMSC has many customers that operate semiconductor plants, and the number of such factories is surging. The sector’s use of electricity is booming as AI proliferates rapidly. Similarly, the company has many customers in the mining and materials sector. That space is growing rapidly as metals prices jump and demand for their use in renewable energy products and electric vehicles rises.\n\nThe shares are down 13% from their March high of $15 and are changing hands at a forward price-sales ratio of three times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI, INTC, and AMSC. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is Wall Street’s new obsession, with companies discussing the technology in a snowballing fashion and helping to keep market sentiment positive.\n\nThe robust quarterly results we’ve received from NVIDIA NVDA over the last year have added further fuel to the fire, with the company flexing the scorching-hot demand it’s been witnessing regarding its AI chips.\n\nStill, outside of NVIDIA, there are several other stocks investors can tap into for AI exposure, including Vertiv VRT, Arista Networks ANET, and Comfort Systems USA FIX. For those interested in exposure to the technology, let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nVertiv\n\nVertiv provides services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities with a portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nScorching-hot demand for the company’s solutions has allowed it to post robust quarterly results, with Vertiv exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 30% across its last four releases. The company’s top line has expanded nicely amid the frenzy, with VRT posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth in seven consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s worth noting that VRT shares pay a small dividend, currently yielding 0.1% annually.\n\nArista Networks\n\nArista Networks, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data centers, campus, and routing environments. Similar to VRT, analysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nANET shares trade at a high multiple, reflective of investors’ positive sentiment surrounding future growth. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple presently stands at 38.9X, above the five-year median and the respective Zacks Computer & Technology sector average.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKeep an eye out for the company’s next quarterly release, expected in early May. Consensus expectations currently allude to 20% earnings growth paired with a 14% sales uptick.\n\nComfort Systems USA\n\nComfort Systems USA provides comprehensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement services. The company provides chillers, cooling towers, and other critical components found within data centers.\n\nThe stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with the revisions trend for its current fiscal year considerably bullish, up 40% over the last year and suggesting 30% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike those above, better-than-expected quarterly results have regularly fueled shares over the last year, gaining a remarkable 150% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. The company remains optimistic about its growth trajectory, underpinned by 27% year-over-year backlog growth in FY23. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI frenzy continues to dominate market headlines, with companies continuing to speak on the technology in a snowballing fashion.\n\nIt isn’t just beloved NVIDIA NVDA enjoying the tailwinds, as Vertiv VRT, Arista Networks ANET, and Comfort Systems USA FIX have also seen the same.\n\nIn addition to AI exposure, all three stocks above sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting the optimism surrounding the technology.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Machine learning stocks are seeing a surge in interest in 2024 thanks to innovations like ChatGPT, which are making investors take notice of the impressive financial growth of Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). All three outpacethe rest of their sector in revenue and EPS growth in the next three to five years.\n\nThe industry’s expansion will also help these machine learning stocks; by 2030, the sector will increase at a 17% annual rate (CAGR 2024-2030) and reach $528 billion. However, all the selections we examine will attract investors for different reasons.\n\nFor example, Palantir is well-known for its ties to the U.S. Department of Defence; a recent $178.4 million transaction is an example. However, U.S. commercial revenues will surpass $640 million by 2024, giving it a dual focus. Meanwhile, Nvidia is driving today’s tech boom, primarily because over 85% of the market is cornered for generative AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, although trailing Nvidia, AMD continues to gain attention because of innovations like its Ryzen 8040 Series CPUs and Instinct MI300X AI accelerator.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir is one of the best machine learning stocks thanks to its strong ties with the U.S. Department of Defense. However, a strong dependence on government contracts usually leads to criticism from a certain section of investors. Usually, investors will read the latest earnings report only to see if the balance is shifting toward commercial.\n\nOn that end, Palantir deserves credit for boosting the number of healthcare, energy, and finance clients. U.S. commercial revenue increased 70% to $131 million in Q4 2023. As a result of this growth, Palantir’s total U.S. commercial revenue for 2023 was $457 million. Palantir projects that its U.S. commercial sales will surpass $640 million in 2024, indicating a 40% growth rate from 2023.\n\nPalantir’s recent partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a good example of its ongoing commercial success. This agreement allows users to take advantage of Palantir’s Gotham and AI platforms while operating the Oracle cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from its success in the commercial realm, Palantir continues to see healthy growth in terms of government contracts. The latest example is a $178.4 million deal to develop the next-generation targeting system, TITAN. Under this deal, ten TITAN prototypes—ground stations that link Army units to space and high-altitude sensors for targeting data—will be developed and manufactured.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is responsible for the 2024 tech stock boom; the stock is up 82% YTD. It controls more than 85% of the generative AI industry accelerators. The business’s yearly sales of AI chips are about $20 billion, highlighting its critical role in expanding AI-driven companies.\n\nOwing to its AI chip dominance, Nvidia beat analyst estimates ten out of the last 12 times. A 588% increase in net income and a 206% increase in sales YOY in Q3 of fiscal 2024 is startling growth for a legacy company.\n\nThe H100 processors added $37.5 billion to sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, becoming a key to its success, and my colleague Chris MacDonald says potential chip sales in the current year can net $93 billion if they make up the majority of chips sold.\n\nNvidia’s strong order backlog from Indian companies demonstrates demand is not solely local. Many nations are seeking ways to circumvent U.S. export restrictions so they may purchase Nvidia processors, even if these restrictions are driving up the price of the company’s chips.\n\nNvidia, though, is not resting on its laurels; the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and GH200 Grace Hopper platform are good examples. The former will help reduce lags in AI workflows, and the latter will help develop faster AI models. AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are already on the Blackwell-powered train. Meanwhile, top manufacturers expect systems running on the Grace Hopper Superchip in Q2 2024.\n\nDespite the stock reaching an all-time high of $950 earlier this year, analysts are projecting upside of 13%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia holds the top spot in the AI chip industry, but perennial number two is also a good investment. Shares are up over 22%, but analysts suggest more upside for the Lisa Su-led company, 18% versus Friday’s close.\n\nThe newly launched Instinct MI300 accelerators and Ryzen 8040 Series CPUs will have a big influence on sales growth; according to the most recent quarterly data, sales have increased 10% year over year, so there is definitely a need for a boost. Meanwhile, the Instinct MI300X, an AI accelerator processor, is predicted to help generate $2 billion in 2024 AI chip sales.\n\nFocusing on machine learning, AMD’s GPUs with the RDNA 3 architecture will simplify processes in this segment. Via the Microsoft DirectML API for Windows, the technology may be used with ONNX, PyTorch and TensorFlow. Developers can also use the platform with the AMD ROCm platform, Linux and Windows Nod.AI SHARK platform.\n\nSeparately, AMD ROCm 6.0 is increasing the capability of AI and machine learning by supporting additional GPUs, including the Radeon PRO W7800 and Radeon RX 7900 GRE.\n\nLastly, AMD earnings are to grow 34% in 2024 and 58% in 2025. Additionally, all investors will appreciate its debt reduction efforts, which shows sound financial management.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "It’s hard to believe we’re already a quarter of the way through 2024. So far, it’s been a solid year for equities, but the first week in April was the worst performance since October 2023. You’ve probably heard a lot of conversation about this being a “stock picker’s market.” That simply means you may have to work a little harder to find stocks to buy.\n\nOne proven way to profit in a stock picker’s market is to look for stocks that are getting upgraded by analysts. This can be particularly true when the upgrades are supported by bullish movement in the stock. If you catch this run-up early enough, there’s still time to ride it higher.\n\nThat’s the case for the three stocks in this article. They are from very different sectors. And the bullish case for each is not the same. But a case does exist, and that’s why you they could be stocks to buy or put on your watchlist as earnings season kicks off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A zoomed in image of a hand placing a CPU chip onto a CPU socket.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe current super cycle in semiconductor stocks has many investors wondering what stock may be the next Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? If you’re one of them, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one to consider. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence applications is creating the need for high bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nMicron is a leader in the category and its new High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E) solution that launched in February sets up the company to continue to capture market share. This is especially true because the HBM3E chip will be embedded into Nvidia’s newest H200 graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nIn the last two quarters, Micron has turned around year-over year (YOY) declines on its top and bottom lines and even with MU stock moving over 111% higher in the last 12 months, it’s likely that the stock price doesn’t fully price in the strong earnings growth expected in the next 12 months.\n\nMU stock started to pull back around $128 per share. However, with 32 analysts giving the stock either a Strong Buy or Buy rating, any pullback is a buyable dip.\n\nStory continues\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe bullish case for making FedEx (NYSE:FDX) one of the second quarter stocks to buy boils down to controlling the controllables. The shipping company can’t do anything to stimulate consumer demand. The company is winding up its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) which is shifting its business to United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).\n\nBut it can manage costs. And investors saw evidence of that in the company’s March earnings report. The company had a slight miss on the top line, but it beat earnings expectations. And earnings were also higher YOY. At least 19 analysts have either reiterated their Buy (or equivalent) ratings or raised their price targets for FDX stock.\n\nFedEx stock is up more than 9% in the last month with much of those gains coming since the earnings report. The stock has pulled back a little since the beginning of April, but this looks like a buyable dip. Analysts consensus price targets give the stock 14% upside and 18 out of 30 analysts have either a Strong Buy or Buy rating on FDX stock.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a retail stock that also falls into the consumer discretionary category that has been beaten down in the last year. But Williams-Sonoma has been an outlier. WSM stock is up 164.5% in the last 12 months. But there’s reason to believe there’s still room for the stock to move higher.\n\nFor starters, the company’s business model targets a more affluent demographic. Not only have these consumers continued to spend on their homes, but they’re also generally not as sensitive to inflation. That’s good for Williams-Sonoma’s operating margin which was 20.1% when the company reported earnings in March.\n\nWSM stock has received approximately 13 upgrades in the last 20 days. However, the stock has a consensus Hold rating. But if you take the long view, the stock is up more than 463% in the last five years. You also get a growing dividend with a very safe payout ratio of around 24%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Caution! 3 Scorching AI Stocks Getting Too Hot to Handle",
        "content": "The stock market rally continues, with last week’s jobs report sparking a rebound. And just a day after a steep slide, investors may wish to become just a bit more selective.\n\nUndoubtedly, AI is still the name of the game for many gain-hungry investors. The boom is unlikely over. Now, good economic data combines with potentially lower inflation and looming rate cuts. So, we may have an environment where it’ll be tough to stand in the way of the market’s momentum.\n\nEven if there’s plenty of runway for the AI stocks boom to continue, the nearer-term trajectory could prove rougher. Understandably, investors look to book profits and spread bets into lower-cost names that may be next AI home run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s examine a trio of AI stocks that are too hot to buy at current prices.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has arguably been the hottest AI stock of 2024, at least so far. Despite retreating more than 20% from its recent peak, SMCI stock remains up over 230% year to date (YTD). Indeed, the recent bear market flop is a tiny blip, even when looking at the YTD chart!\n\nTrue, new Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips, which SMCI is sure to adapt swiftly, act as a nice near-term catalyst. But, I’m simply not comfortable pursuing SMCI stock, given the chart’s unappetizing appeal of recent weeks.\n\nWith a potential head-and-shoulders technical formation that may very well be developing, I’m too scared to be a net buyer here and will stay glued to the sidelines. Shares remain quite frothy at 74.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shed around 20% of its value since peaking in early March. With more negative momentum this past month than NVDA, as well as a higher trailing P/E ratio, take a “raincheck” on AMD. And this is especially relevant if AI stocks are rocked further from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, AMD is a wonderful number-two AI chip titan that cannot be dismissed. With CEO Lisa Su running the show, AMD may be empowered to become even better than most Magnificent Seven companies over the long run. However, in the near term, shares may remain at high risk of a steeper pullback.\n\nPerhaps a better entry point will present itself for patient AI investors. AMD is working hard behind the scenes to maintain (or even advance) its lead in AI acceleration and a potential AI PC boom. In short, AMD’s a great business, but the price is a higher than desirable.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) will likely perform well as the AI boom unfolds in the coming years. After the stock’s recent vertical spike, the big-data juggernaut may be at high risk of a near-term pullback. This is especially true as AI enthusiasm temporarily fades, at least until the next big breakthrough.\n\nFor long-term investors, any further weakness in PLTR stock may serve as a fantastic buying opportunity. With shares down more than 13%, the stock still doesn’t seem cheap enough. Consider that it is fresh off a six-day losing streak.\n\nJust last week, Wall Street analyst Brian White of Monness warned Palantir stock as valuation is excessive. With shares trading at more than 23.7 times price-to-sales, White could be right indeed.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Are Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) bull market is here.\n\nFollowing the launch of ChatGPT, the power of generative AI technology has become clear, and tech companies are racing to take advantage of it, both to find better ways to serve their customers and to make their operations more efficient.\n\nInvestors have also caught on to this trend, and investor enthusiasm is a big reason why tech stocks have soared since the beginning of 2023, with the \"Magnificent Seven\" leading the way.\n\nLet's take a look at a few of the companies leading the AI race. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's impossible to talk about generative AI without mentioning Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been at the center of the AI revolution, as they're the most valued piece of infrastructure in running AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia prepared for this moment years ago, building out its capabilities in AI and partnering with companies like OpenAI, and it's paid off. The company has an estimated 98% market share of the data center GPU market, and its technological leadership and soaring demand for its components have led to a shortage and given it tremendous pricing power.\n\nNvidia's recent results speak for themselves, and explain why the stock has jumped more than 400% since the beginning of 2023, making it the third-most-valuable company in the world behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, driven by 409% growth in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 769% to $12.3 billion, giving it a profit margin above 50%.\n\nNvidia's growth rate will slow down, but the company has a solid lead in AI technology, which should mean it remains a winner.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhile Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, Microsoft has established itself as the leader in AI software.\n\nBecause of its partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion, and its diversification across multiple tech platforms, Microsoft has the ability to deploy AI capabilities across multiple product lines, and that's what it's doing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the help of OpenAI, Microsoft has added AI technology to products like Azure cloud computing, GitHub code repository, Microsoft Office, and Bing search engine, and it's deployed its AI Copilot chatbot across those products and others.\n\nThose efforts are having an impact on the business already. For example, management said in its most recent quarter that six points of Azure's 30% revenue growth came from AI.\n\nMicrosoft also has no intention of taking its foot off the gas. The company recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, who is considered one of the top minds in AI. It also hired several of its employees from Inflection AI after the AI start-up folded.\n\nMicrosoft and CEO Satya Nadella have bet big on AI, and the company will continue to look for new ways to leverage the new technology.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) hasn't gotten as much attention as Nvidia or Microsoft in the AI race, but it deserves to be recognized as one of the leaders.\n\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired the AI lab DeepMind in 2014 and recently merged it with Google Brain. It's also been developing its own AI technologies for roughly a decade.\n\nAlphabet has been less aggressive than Microsoft in AI, but the Google parent quickly responded to the launch of ChatGPT with its own chatbot, Bard. That has evolved into Gemini, which may be the closest challenger to ChatGPT today.\n\nAlphabet's investments in its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary shouldn't be overlooked either. While self-driving cars have largely been a disappointment thus far, Waymo appears to be the leader in the emerging technology, and its driverless vehicles are now on the road, ferrying passengers in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.\n\nThe company also uses AI to improve search results on both Google Search and YouTube and to offer increased functionality in Google Cloud.\n\nMuch like its rival Microsoft, you can expect Alphabet to look for new ways to integrate AI in its products as it's bet big on the booming technology and plans to be a leader.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Sales in February 2023 totaled $39.7 billion.\n\nHowever, after a steady rise over the past few months, semiconductor sales fell 3.1% from January's total of $47.6.\n\nRegionally, year-over-year sales increased 28.8% in China, 22% in the Americas and 15.4% in Asia Pacific. However, sales declined 8.5% in Europe.\n\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, \"Although month-to-month sales were down slightly, global semiconductor sales in February remained well ahead of the total from the same month last year, a continuation of the strong year-to-year growth the market has experienced since the middle of last year.\"\n\nThe semiconductor industry's growth stalled after reaching unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nRising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to combat inflation acted as headwinds for the industry, particularly as demand slowed during the second half of 2022.\n\nAs inflation began to ease, alleviating price pressures, demand rebounded.\n\nAlso, the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, is expected to stimulate semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI has tremendous potential and the world is yet to witness that.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis has seen a large number of tech companies exploring the avenue in their bid to grab business opportunities. This is further likely to make semiconductors all the more important in the near term.\n\nAccording to a forecast by Gartner, global semiconductor revenues are projected to jump 16.8% this year totaling $624 billion.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corp.,Lam Research Corp., Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc. and ACM Research, Inc., which investors can gain from in the near term.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There's been a surge in tech stocks over the last year, which has seen the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rise 47% in the last 12 months. Increased interest in budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) has rallied investors, sending countless stocks skyrocketing. Suffice it to say that AI has created a lot of millionaires over the last year. Meanwhile, the sector has shown no signs of slowing.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The trajectory will see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, suggesting that the market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling and it's not too late to invest in AI.\n\nSo, here are three millionaire-maker artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nYou might be sick of hearing about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by now. The company has featured in countless headlines over the last year as bullish investors have sent its stock rising 218% since last April. However, all eyes have been on this chipmaker for good reason, and it likely still has much to offer new investors thanks to its powerful position in AI.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia captured an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models. The company got a head start compared to its rivals, which has likely secured its dominance in the budding market for years.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia remains on a promising growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates seem to support its potential. Data by YCharts.\n\nThe chart above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Considering the overwhelming demand for GPUs over the next couple of years, I'd expect the forward P/E to hover around similar levels under similar macro-economic conditions. So multiplying the expected 2026 EPS by its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,296 -- an upside of 48% form current priec levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 46% over the next two years. The company may not replicate last year's growth, but it would still beat the S&P 500's 15% growth since 2022.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLike Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) role as a leading chipmaker gives it massive potential in AI. The company's stock has climbed 85% over the last year, rallying Wall Street with its growing prospects in the industry.\n\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party as Nvidia beat it to the market. However, AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in AI over the long term.\n\nLast December, AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly earnings suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. Data by YCharts.\n\nAMD's earnings are projected to reach $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. Again like Nvidia, I expect AMD's forward P/E of 50 to continue hovering at similar levels which implies a share price of $350 by 2026, and by extension, a doubling of stock price from today's levels.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nShares in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have risen 77% in the last year, no doubt creating millionaires along the way.\n\nThe company has leading positions in multiple tech areas, including e-commerce, the cloud market, gaming, consumer products, and more. However, all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nAmazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but it also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. Data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon's earnings are expected to reach nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia and AMD, multiplying that figure by the retail giant's forward P/E of 43 yields a stock price of $301, which could see its shares increase by 65% by fiscal 2026.\n\nAs a result, Amazon is a millionaire-maker stock worth considering in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $539,230!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Tech Bargain Hunting: 3 Underestimated Stocks Poised for a Breakout",
        "content": "The technology sector is generally responsible for innovation and growth. Thus, it’s no surprise that it often produces highly valued stocks. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are great examples of the sector. Yet, there are plenty of underestimated tech stocks poised for a breakout.\n\nOnce these bargain stocks break out they tend to create instant value for investors. Fortunately, there are relatively easy ways to identify shares with such potential. Value metrics are an extremely useful tool, but they are not the only factors investors should consider when hunting for bargains.\n\nThematic direction of markets and how a given stock fits such narratives should also be examined. Let’s take a look at three underestimated stocks poised for a breakout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has undertaken an effort to rejuvenate its business and make it stronger in relation to recurring revenues. That’s the thrust of the logic behind its recent acquisition of Splunk.\n\nThe deal is expected to add $4.2 billion in annual recurring revenues to Cisco Systems. CSCO itself reported $25 billion in annual recurring revenues in the most recent year. The acquisition will better align Cisco Systems with the analytics and cyber security markets overall.\n\nThat should be a boon to CSCO shares, which are generally viewed as a more conservative choice overall. Part of the reason Cisco Systems has undertaken such a transition is related to declining earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter.\n\nCSCO stock is a bargain based on its P/E ratio. It’s reasonable to anticipate that ratio will rise as more attractive software earnings enter the mix following the Splunk acquisition.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is often one of the first stocks discussed when it comes to the confluence of tech and income. The chip manufacturer’s shares include a dividend yielding roughly 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Qualcomm is undervalued when it comes to price to free cash flow ratio. QCOM’s strong free cash flow implies several things. First of all, Qualcomm’s ability to produce such cash flows is particularly beneficial given that it does pay dividends. Further, it also suggests that the company has the cash on hand to operate after everything else is done. That allows the company the latitude to do as it pleases.\n\nThe point here is that Qualcomm’s cash position gives it the ability to seek growth. That means the company is one of a few that provides income and growth opportunities to investors.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is undervalued for the simple fact that it is making a push to provide for Nvidia.\n\nThe company recently began mass production of high bandwidth memory chips for use in Nvidia’s most up-to-date AI chips.\n\nThe South Korean firm’s rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have decided to work together to address Micron’s challenge. That admission was highly unprecedented and speaks to their fear Micron will establish an insurmountable early lead. Micron is ahead of both South Korean firms in terms of production and is in position to become an integral supplier to Nvidia. MU has a technological advantage over Samsung that could prove particularly beneficial.\n\nMicron is also better positioned from the perspective that it is a U.S. company. Firms located in the US will have an easier time in the lead up to the presidential election. for all of those reasons Micron is underestimated.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The world is a different, and better, place because of semiconductors. These little devices have become vital to everyday life in the 21st century. That’s why it’s a good idea to consider semiconductor stocks to buy in April.\n\nSemiconductors are tiny but powerful. They play an important role in powering smartphones, laptop computers, vehicles, and medical equipment. Semiconductors are responsible for the sophisticated electronic equipment that we use every day.\n\nSemiconductors are also becoming more powerful, allowing companies to develop applications that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Generative AI has become one of the biggest growth drivers for tech companies over the last year, making its advances possible by semiconductors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader today to look for A-rated and B-rated semiconductor stocks that you can buy in April to capitalize on this trend. The names on this list stand out because of their growth, earnings performance and momentum.\n\nThey represent the best opportunities for anyone looking for semiconductor stocks to buy in April, and to capitalize on the backbone of the digital revolution.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nAny examination of the best semiconductor stocks to buy in April has to start with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company’s stock rocketed 239% higher in 2023 and is well on its way to matching that gain in 2024.\n\nNvidia is dominating the market because of its enormous position in generative AI. It manufactures roughly 90% of the most powerful graphics processing units used in generative AI applications.\n\nAnd now its rolling out its Blackwell GPUs, which will allow organizations to run real-time generative AI with trillion-parameter large language models at 25 times less cost and energy consumption.\n\nLook for the biggest tech companies in the world to incorporate the Blackwell chip into their designs, and for profits to continue to flow for Nvidia. NVDA stock is up 73% so far in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor manufacturer Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) makes chips used in data centers, networking, software, storage, wireless and industrial applications.\n\nBroadcom products power Ethernet switching and routing silicon products, controllers and transceivers.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting thing for Broadcom, however, is its acquisition of VMware, which allows it to capitalize on VMware’s hybrid cloud platform. The platform provides large corporate customers with the power of a cloud network with on-premise data centers, and uses Nvidia GPUs to allow its customers to run AI models on-site.\n\nWhile Broadcom has a heavy reliance on mobile chip customers, I like the moves it is making to expand into infrastructure software. Broadcom expects roughly half of its revenue to be from this category in 2024, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the biggest growth opportunity for AVGO moving forward.\n\nAVGO stock is up 18% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has long been a top competitor to Nvidia, but it was left behind by Nvidia’s massive gains in 2023.\n\nAnd AMD faced a fresh challenge in recent weeks when it was announced that China plans to phase out the use of AMD chips in its government PCs and servers. That helped push AMD stock from more than $200 per share just a month ago to around $165 today.\n\nBut I think there are brighter days ahead, and the bull thesis continues to hold for AMD. AMD’s Mi300 GPU accelerator is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue this year as an alternative to NVDA chips.\n\nAMD also has a huge opportunity to provide AI-PC chips for AI-compatible central processing units for the personal computer market.\n\nAMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $6.1 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Earnings were $667 million and 41 cents per share, an improvement from $21 million and 1 cent per share in the same quarter of 2022.\n\nAMD stock is attractive here on the dip. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhether you think it’s Nvidia, AMD or another company that will be the dominant force in providing Big Tech with the best semiconductors, it remains a smart bet to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).\n\nThe company, commonly known as TSMC, is the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, responsible for more than half of all contract chip manufacturing. And when it comes to making the most powerful chips on the planet, TSMC has roughly a 90% market share.\n\nNvidia, AMD and Broadcom all rely on TSMC to make their semiconductors. So, if you are betting on any or all of those companies, you’re also banking on TSMC to realize profits.\n\nTSMC issued guidance for first-quarter revenue between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, with strong demand for high-performing chips. If it can top those numbers when it issues its report, you can expect TSM stock to jump.\n\nTSM is up 34% so far in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor manufacturing company headquartered in Boise, Idaho. The company makes products for memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND and NOR technology.\n\nDRAM chips are used in every computing system, and AI systems require a lot of high-speed DRAM capacity. “We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.\n\nMicron posted its biggest sales gain in 12 years after posting guidance for the fiscal third quarter of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, far exceeding analysts’ consensus estimates for $5.99 billion. That comes on the heels of Micron reporting fiscal Q2 revenue of $5.82 billion, an increase from $3.69 billion just a year ago. Income of $476 million and 42 cents per share improved from a loss of  $2.08 billion and $1.91 per share in fiscal Q2 2023.\n\nMU stock is up 45% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is another way to play the semiconductor space without investing in an actual semiconductor manufacturer. Instead, you can invest in a company that makes products that work with semiconductors.\n\nThat’s where we get with Photronics, a Connecticut company that makes semiconductor photomasks. These are opaque plates with transparent areas that allow light to shine through in specific patterns on semiconductors.\n\nThe market for semiconductor photomasks is estimated at $4 billion.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation",
        "content": "Technology stocks have driven the S&P 500 higher over the past year or so, leading the index out of bear territory and to a record high earlier this year, confirming we are indeed in a bull market. These types of markets favor growth stocks, so it's likely technology players will hold onto the momentum and climb higher in the months to come.\n\nSome already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.)\n\nLet's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared more than 200% over the past year on optimism about its dominance in the AI chip market. The company holds about 80% share, and thanks to its increases in research and development spending, and its pledge to continue releasing more and more powerful chips, its leadership is likely to last.\n\nJust recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year.\n\nAmong these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's chip dominance has helped its earnings to soar over the past few years, and in the most recent quarter, revenue and net income rose in the triple digits. Considering this track record and the strengths I mention above, the stock seems reasonably priced at 34 times forward-earnings estimates today.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) shares have climbed more than 130% in a year as the company emerges from a period of cost cuts and ramps up investment in growth. And this growth includes a focus on AI, Meta's biggest investment area this year.\n\nYou probably know Meta more for its social media platforms than for its presence in the world of AI. The company owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and every day more than 3.1 billion people use at least one of these apps. Meta has a rock-solid moat, or competitive advantage, thanks to this brand strength, and that keeps its biggest source of revenue -- advertisers -- coming back to reach users of these apps.\n\nThis has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend.\n\nMeta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has advanced about 70% over the past year as the company emerges from a difficult period and shows it has what it takes to win over the long term.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade.\n\nMoving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term.\n\nThat's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The crypto sector has been on a tear, propelled higher by none other than the leading digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Its rise has proliferated into other digital assets, with many investors in this space focusing on cryptos alone.\n\nSo, within this sector, two key catalysts could drive greater upside over the near-term. They both have to do with Bitcoin. First is the upcoming halving event, set to take place in a couple weeks. And the second is the impact spot ETFs will have on the entire sector.\n\nAs more money flows into this space, and Bitcoin’s price rises following its halving, other related companies should benefit. Some publicly-traded companies do well when crypto does well. Much focus now is shifted to spot Bitcoin ETFs (which can be bought and sold on the markets just as stocks are). However, a valuation gap may be coming into play.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, let’s dive into three crypto stocks to benefit most from a possible vicious rally higher for the rest of the year.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nShowing up as the top blockchain stock worldwide, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a top option for equity investors. It provides the critical infrastructure to support the largest centralized exchange in the U.S.\n\nDespite legal and regulatory challenges, Coinbase is still the top player in its industry. As such, when the SEC did approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase took over handling the back-end functionality for most of the companies that successfully received approvals from regulators.\n\nNotably, analysts have been upgrading the stock in recent weeks. Kyle Voigt, an analyst from KBW, expressed their impressions on COIN as it has showed unique exposure in the crypto economy. This analyst raised his price target to $230 from $160, while maintaining a market performance rating, noting potential revenue growth from increased USD Coin balances and rising crypto asset levels. Currently, COIN stock trades around $250 per share, so there’s still downside baked into this target. But it’s a significant raise, nonetheless.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter, outstanding USDC balances surged by 32%, per reports. USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle and backed by Coinbase, contributes to the crypto exchange’s gross interest income, generating about 56% of this key metric. Additionally, March saw a spike in average daily trading volume to $5.1 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in February, driving momentum for the stock.\n\nIf more capital continues to flow into the crypto sector, it’s likely to come through Coinbase, at least in the U.S. Accordingly, the thesis is very simple with this crypto stock.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) Macro view of miner working for bitcoins mine pool. Devices and technology for mining cryptocurrency. Mining cryptocurrency concept. MARA stock. Crypto mining.\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is among the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, making it deserving of a spot on this list.\n\nRecent bearish sentiment around the upcoming Bitcoin halving has led to selling pressure for MARA stock. That makes sense, since the company’s revenue (at least in terms of Bitcoin mined) will halve overnight.\n\nBut for those bullish on Bitcoin’s price rising materially following its halving, this is a stock to consider. Recent innovations like MARAFW firmware and MARA UCB 2100 control board aim to optimize mining rigs, enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, the company’s MARA 2PIC700 cooling system promises higher power density. So this will enable robust expansion despite the halving’s impact.\n\nAlso, Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin production and revenue demonstrate the pivotal role of mining output in its performance assessment. With expanded operations and hash rate, MARA should benefit from rising Bitcoin prices over time. Of course, a Bitcoin price at least 50% above current levels will likely be needed to spark another major rally in this miner. But for those who think that’s possible, buying now may be a decent strategy.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuring this year’s crypto surge, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, saw its market cap surpass that of almost half the S&P 500 companies. MicroStrategy’s stock surged 204% in 2024, reaching $1,919 by Wednesday’s close. Contrast this to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 82% year-to-date (YTD) increase.\n\nHaving initially invested in Bitcoin as an inflation safeguard in August 2020, MicroStrategy continuously accumulated Bitcoin. Today, the company holds a total of 214,246 BTC, becoming the leading corporate holder of this digital asset. While opinions vary on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, it remains a notable aspect of its operations.\n\nMicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average of $33,706 per Bitcoin. Now, they are valued at $65,000 each. This greatly influences its trajectory. With Bitcoin holdings valued at around $14 billion, this business now vastly overshadows MicroStrategy’s business intelligence segment, providing significant leverage for the future. Predictions of Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 by next year underscore its enduring value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Here's the $4.7 Trillion Market Nvidia Has Its Eyes on Now",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could make the same statement attributed to Julius Caesar: \"Veni, vidi, vici.\" The phrase translates into \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\" The chipmaker has conquered quite a bit since its founding in 1993.\n\nFor years, Nvidia made most of its money in the gaming market. More recently, however, the company's growth has come largely from the deployment of its GPUs in data centers. What's the next frontier for Nvidia? Here's the $4.7 trillion market the chipmaker has its eyes on now.\n\nBig moves in a big market\n\nThe U.S. spent an estimated $4.7 trillion on healthcare last year. That amounts to roughly 18% of the country's total economic output. Nvidia has recently made several major moves in this big market.\n\nTo be sure, healthcare isn't a brand-new focus for Nvidia. The company's technology has been used in healthcare before. For example, Nvidia launched its Clara AI platform for medical imaging in 2018. However, the company appears to have shifted its healthcare efforts into a higher gear.\n\nNvidia has announced multiple new healthcare collaborations and services over the last few weeks. On March 18, the company introduced a new suite of 25 \"microservices\" for healthcare organizations. This platform enables customers to integrate generative AI into existing applications.\n\nAt its 2024 GTC AI Conference in March, Nvidia announced two major milestones with healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson and GE Healthcare. It's working with Johnson & Johnson to use AI in surgical operations. GE Healthcare used Nvidia's technology to develop a model for analyzing ultrasound images.\n\nHow AI (and Nvidia) could transform healthcare\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that AI holds the potential to transform healthcare. How? Let's start with diagnosing diseases. AI has already shown tremendous promise in analyzing medical images, as GE Healthcare is doing with Nvidia's TensorRT software. The technology can help rapidly analyze test results, create personalized medical risk assessments for patients, and provide decision support for physicians.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome biopharmaceutical companies use AI in their drug development process. In particular, AI can predict protein structures and analyze genetic sequences. Nvidia isn't just helping biotech companies on this front; it also invested $50 million in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI for drug discovery.\n\nAI can make medical technology devices more effective. That's what J&J hopes to do by using Nvidia's IGX edge computing platform and Holoscan edge AI platform to help develop new surgical devices.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints that U.S. healthcare professionals have is the amount of administrative work they must do. AI holds the potential to streamline a wide range of administrative tasks, including appointment scheduling, claims processing, and clinical documentation. This hasn't been a major area of focus for Nvidia so far, but it could present a big opportunity for the company.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock because of its healthcare efforts?\n\nNvidia's ongoing expansion into the lucrative healthcare market could achieve tremendous success. However, I don't think these healthcare efforts by themselves justify buying the stock right now.\n\nBut what about the combination of Nvidia's healthcare initiatives and everything else the company is doing? Its overall growth prospects remain highly attractive. My chief concern with Nvidia is that its stock has such lofty expectations baked in that any hint of less-than-spectacular results could cause shares to fall hard.\n\nStill, I think any pullback would present a great buying opportunity for this high-flying stock. And that's my view regardless of whether Nvidia conquers the healthcare market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $539,230!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Is Like Cisco Stock Before the Dot-Com Crash? There Are Big Holes in This Theory",
        "content": "Recently, I've spotted several article headlines warning Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors to be cautious because its stock's recent big run-up shares key similarities with Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) stock's huge run-up in the 1990s before it crashed in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst. In just one year, Cisco stock plummeted 77% after hitting its all-time high on March 27, 2000.\n\nLet's dig into the qualitative reasons why the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s isn't a good one. A second article on this topic will focus on the quantitative reasons, including differences in profit margin trends and stock valuations.\n\nNvidia 2024 = Cisco Systems late 1990s theory has more holes than an AI supercomputer has GPUs\n\nThe above subheading is a reference to Nvidia's business -- and yes, it's an exaggeration because artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers can have thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia is the dominant maker of GPUs for accelerating the processing of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads in data centers. It has an estimated 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. It also targets other markets, but its data center business is its largest, accounting for 83% of its revenue last quarter.\n\nTo be clear -- I'm not saying Nvidia stock is immune to a big decline or even a crash. No doubt, it would plunge if the company's GPUs lost their status as the favored chips for speeding up the training of AI models and the running of AI applications in data centers, and if it failed to develop whatever tech had displaced GPUs for these fast-growing uses. My premise is simply that the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s is not a good one. The similarities are only surface deep.\n\nKey qualitative differences between Nvidia now and Cisco in the late 199Os\n\nCisco's CEO in the below chart refers to John Chambers, who led the company from 1995 to 2015. Cisco was founded in 1984 by two Stanford University computer scientists and went public in 1990.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has had only one CEO since its founding in 1993, co-founder Jensen Huang. The company went public in 1999.\n\nQualitative Metric Cisco Systems Late 1990s Nvidia Now Run by a founder-CEO? No Yes CEO educational background* Business (including an MBA) and legal Electrical engineering (including a master's degree) CEO work background* - Technology sales at IBM\n\n- VP of Operations at Wang Laboratories (a now-defunct computer company) Microprocessor design for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Company's primary growth driver Internet adoption and growth AI adoption and growth, particularly generative AI.*** (A notable secondary driver is the growth of computer gaming.) Main products Internet networking products (hardware and software) and services. Main hardware products in the 1990s included switches (LAN and WAN)**, access servers, and routers. Primarily GPU chips and related hardware, software, and services. It also offers other chips, such as central processing units (CPUs) and a \"superchip,\" which is basically a combined CPU-GPU. Competitive moat Moderate-to-high overall High overall -- Its GPUs and associated hardware and software have a high degree of complexity. Growth strategy Considerable focus on acquisitions Heavily organic growth. Acquisitions have mainly been small, except for 2020's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, which makes high-performance networking products.\n\n*According to public records. **LAN = local area network; WAN = wide area network. *** Generative AI is the tech behind OpenAI's extremely popular ChatGPT chatbot, released in late 2022.\n\nStudies support the theory that stocks of public companies run by founder-CEOs tend to perform better over the long term than those run by non-founders. Huang is a co-founder of Nvidia; Chambers was not involved in founding Cisco.\n\nHuang's educational and work background before starting Nvidia was in electrical engineering and semiconductor design, respectively. These factors give him a major advantage over CEOs of technology companies whose backgrounds are not as technical, in my view.\n\nCisco's moat to keep competition at bay in the late 1990s was not as high as Nvidia's current moat. Nvidia's mighty moat isn't just due to the complexity of its products, but also stems from the fact that its ecosystem is huge and growing, thanks to its early mover status in the data center AI chip space. This ecosystem includes \"over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets,\" the company said in its annual report filed in February.\n\nThe moat differences will be more evident in my second article on this topic focusing on quantitative factors. Suffice it to say here that Cisco's profit margins were steadily declining for a few years before its stock plunged. One main reason was competitive pressures on pricing. Nvidia's profit margins are currently at record highs.\n\nLet's move to the last category in the chart -- growth strategy. Cisco in the 1990s was a corporate equivalent of the iconic video game Pac-Man -- it devoured a lot of companies. From 1993 through July 2000, the company \"acquired or announced our intent to acquire 65 companies,\" it said in its fiscal year 2000 annual report.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is mostly growing organically. Granted, it relatively recently made one huge acquisition, Mellanox, but it had already been growing at a robust pace before this deal. In other words, Nvidia didn't need to \"buy growth.\" And prior to this acquisition, Mellanox was a Nvidia partner, not a competitor, so it didn't buy the company in order to get rid of a competitor.\n\nGrowth strategies that heavily focus on acquisitions are very challenging to pull off successfully. They take the time and attention of top execs away from focusing on internal innovation. They eat up money that could be spent on research and development. In addition, it's difficult to meld different corporate cultures.\n\nNot surprisingly, Apple, one of the most successful and innovative companies of the last few decades, is known to prioritize organic growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Chip Manufacturing Stock Making a Big Bet on AI",
        "content": "A battle is brewing in an under-followed part of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry: chip design software. Several merger and acquisition deals have been announced, and a mega-merger is pending between electronic design automation (EDA) leader Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) and Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS). Shortly after that was announced, the second EDA software suite, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS), revealed its new supercomputing platform for simulating electronic systems.\n\nNot wanting to get left behind, Japanese chip manufacturer Renesas (OTC: RNECY) announced its intention to acquire smaller EDA software provider Altium (OTC: ALMF.F). Is something big brewing in the AI market?\n\nRenesas looks for a software boost\n\nRenesas is an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures semiconductors. It's a hybrid business model that has been making a comeback in recent years. Besides Japan emerging as a top destination for manufacturing in the East, Renesas can thank the electric vehicle (EV) revolution for its resurgence, as well as a myriad of other more mature manufacturing processes (not leading-edge chips for things like data center AI) for chips in industrial and power applications. RNECY Chart\n\nAmong some other smaller acquisitions to bolster its power chip portfolio, I wrote last year about Renesas' deal with Wolfspeed(NYSE: WOLF) to purchase silicon carbide (SiC) wafers for use in next-gen applications like EV motors.\n\nBut the purchase of Altium, a small competitor to the EDA software giants Synopsys and Cadence, is something else entirely. Tiny Australia-based Altium (which, notably, counts Wolfspeed as a chip design customer) generated revenue of just $139 million in U.S. dollars in the first half of its current 2024 fiscal year. And yet Renesas will be shelling out A$9.1 billion ($6 billion in U.S. dollars, using exchange rates on April 5, 2024). That's a hefty price premium. ALMFF Market Cap Chart\n\nRenesas' stated rationale is to boost the software and digital tool capabilities it offers its clients, as many of those customers (automakers, for example) are non-techies who may need help implementing next-gen electronics.\n\nStory continues\n\nA big wave of AI coming?\n\nAs of right now, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA)data center AI systems are all the rage as companies are looking to use their data to \"train\" new AI systems. But in the decade to follow, all of those AI systems will need to go somewhere in order for users to benefit from their creation.\n\nThat's likely where Renesas sees massive opportunity by purchasing Altium, and competing with Synopsys and Cadence in electronics system design. Semiconductor manufacturing companies have a pathway to sustained growth thanks to customer interest in embedding intelligent computing systems across a broad ecosystem of devices, from cars to automated factory equipment to smart home devices. Image source: Altium.\n\nAll that new AI embedded in devices themselves, rather than housed in data centers, is going to need far more sophisticated hardware. It's also going to need more energy-efficient hardware, like the type Renesas has been working on (again, with the Wolfspeed deal). Renesas could secure itself a seat at the table for years to come by combining not just the chips, but also the software, to make those AI devices a reality.\n\nRenesas could be a hidden growth stock in the AI race. Shares trade for about 13 times trailing 12-month earnings and free cash flow, a potential bargain if it can keep building a head of steam in its semiconductor manufacturing and design business for autos, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Renesas Electronics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Renesas Electronics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Renesas Electronics wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nMaybe I'm going to tell you something here you already know, but it bares repeating.\n\nI do not think the majority of public company corporate boards, C-suites, investor relations departments, and other related teams generally give a horse's butt about the retail investor. Aka the average investor aka Main Street aka a person grinding away each day in the hopes of living comfortably in retirement.\n\nChances are that's you, reading this Sunday morning, drinking a cup of homemade coffee while wondering if you should add 25 more shares of something priced under $5. Or one share of Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHow can I make such a bold proclamation?\n\nFor one, I talk to people in all these groups every single day of my waking life, and have for 21 years. Everyone is so fixated on their compensation plans, perks of the gig, what institutional investors may do, what a competitor is saying on TV, and if an influential sell-side analyst is about to slash estimates and drop a rating.\n\nOther worries include business plans, their execution of them, and nailing the highly publicized succession to an underboss.\n\nI never hear them discuss how their actions may affect the average investor. And I mean never.\n\nSecondarily, just look at how companies speak to the outside world when they are forced to do so. It continues to be some form of morse code that requires a Harvard honors degree to decode.\n\nTake 10 minutes today and try to read the last earnings call transcript for Microsoft (MSFT). Here it is for easy reference. Be honest, do you have any idea what they are talking about, and how it may shape the value of the 10 shares you own? Probably not; I am often lost in the jargon myself.\n\nGood luck trying to comprehend all the abbreviations in the notoriously exhaustive earnings release from Coca-Cola (KO). Here is the company's last earnings report. How can a company that makes such simple products (water with various sugars and dyes) put out such complicated earnings releases?\n\nStory continues\n\nI bring all this up in the wake of the Disney (DIS) vs. Nelson Peltz boardroom battle.\n\nThroughout the entire ordeal, we heard Disney CEO Bob Iger fire back at billionaire Peltz. We heard Peltz fire back at the very fit 73-year-old Iger. We saw both parties beg and plead to get the support of institutional investors such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price.\n\nNeither person spoke directly to retail investors, probably because they thought it was beneath their existence on Earth. Neither one went Elon Musk style and held a webcast to take questions from the average shareholder.\n\nIger could have done this; they're a media company and surely have the assets to execute (drop me a line, Bob, we can host these webcasts on Yahoo Finance).\n\nAt the end of the day, it was the retail investor that played a large role in the final outcome.\n\nRetail investors represent just under 40% of Disney's shareholder base. Some 75% of retail investors who cast votes backed Disney's slate, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIf Peltz had spoken directly to this group, maybe he would have a board seat at Disney. If Iger had appealed directly to this group, maybe his win would've been even larger — giving him yet another moment to boast about at a movie premiere before he retires maybe in 2026.\n\nSo now my message to Iger is this: The average investor who owns your stock because they enjoy Mickey, your movies, and the dividend check has supported you and what you want to do. Show them respect because they are a powerful group. Deliver for them.\n\nRetail trading volume hit a high in 2023. Between 2019 and 2022, direct stock ownership increased to 21% from 15%, according to Federal Reserve data, the largest change on record.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Economic Forum estimates that retail investors will account for 61% of global assets under management by 2030. That number stood at 52% in 2021.\n\nRetail investors are a force to be reckoned with, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\n\"They certainly follow the action and are attracted to the big names and oddball situations that crop up,\" said Sosnick.\n\nHe is right.\n\nAnd Bob, you can't get complacent either or this group will turn — and likely influence larger investors more than this latest go around. Execute, or else.\n\n\"The pressure on Bob Iger [until he retires in 2026] will stay really right,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Activists are circling this company and they're only kept at bay if the share price keeps going up.\"\n\nDisney declined to make Bob Iger available to Yahoo Finance for an interview.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "This April, investors continue to chase after record-high growth stocks. While many of these companies offer pathways to wealth, many may be hurt by a coming economic shock. Thus, picking the right growth stocks to own before the Fed rate cut is important.\n\nFocus on growth stocks with solid fundamentals and skilled management teams. These companies promise substantial long-term returns despite occasional setbacks. Diversification and strategic placement can maximize wealth accumulation opportunities in portfolios.\n\nHere are three of the best stocks to buy as the Federal Reserve potentially steps back from its tight monetary policy stance and begins cutting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaird recently upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to outperform and raised their price target to $87. This upgrade was driven by positive operational trends, with Shopify showing steady growth in net active stores. This growth was notably seen in strategic sectors like Shopify Plus and international markets, bolstering the company’s long-term outlook. Indeed, I agree with the analysts that these segments will play a vital role in Shopify’s business strategy moving forward.\n\nThe firm’s revised e-commerce platform survey aligns with the company’s focus, prompting the price target adjustment. Analysts noted stable market conditions with revenue estimates slightly above consensus but profitability lagging.\n\nShopify boasts a market cap of $96 billion, affirming its top e-commerce platform provider dominance. Despite a high price-earnings and price-sales multiple relative to previous results, investors are pricing in much better forward numbers. The company’s recent revenue growth of more than 26% and solid bottom-line growth support such a view.\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the star of video conferencing during the pandemic, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) still wows the public with its AI innovations. Its most recent AI integration is the Zoom Workplace, an AI collaboration platform that helps workforces enhance teamwork. The launch includes features like Ask AI Companion, a refreshed app interface, and improvements to the Zoom Contact Center for improved customer engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmita Hashim, Zoom’s product chief, emphasized the significant benefits of Zoom AI Companion in enhancing collaborative workflows. Introducing Zoom Workplace with AI Companion aims to address user needs by integrating core collaboration tools into a unified AI-powered platform, improving productivity and efficiency. The latest AI Companion features, including Ask AI Companion and Zoom Phone and Team Chat enhancements, offer added value at no extra cost.\n\nFollowing pressure from European regulators, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a division of its Teams and Office bundles on Monday, relieving competitors. Despite struggles against Microsoft’s communication suite, Zoom saw its video chat app soar during the pandemic. Mizuho analysts suggest separating MS Teams may ease enterprise churn, recommending buying Zoom shares.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis past year was one of the best for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company saw excellent growth, leading to a stock price that surged 259%. The main catalyst behind this rise? A surge of interest in artificial intelligence and related companies.\n\nAs the key purveyor of high-performance chips used by AI companies and those developing applications, Nvidia has absolutely been on a rocket ship higher. This year alone, the stock is up roughly 80%, signaling just how powerful investors see this company’s future earnings coming in.\n\nAt its recent GTC conference, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip, ushering in a new computing era. The architecture offers six transformative technologies, enabling real-time generative AI at significantly lower costs and energy usage. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for industries like deep learning and quantum computing, driving AI’s widespread adoption.\n\nAside from the tech sector, Nvidia has expanded into healthcare by collaborating with the startup Hippocratic AI. Hippocratic AI develops virtual agents using Nvidia’s technology to streamline patient care tasks like appointment scheduling and post-discharge follow-ups. Leveraging Nvidia’s Avatar Cloud and NIM microservices, Hippocratic AI aims to enhance its health-focused large language model.\n\nFor those looking for AI exposure, Nvidia remains the best option in this space. And while its stock isn’t cheap, on a forward basis, its valuation isn’t insane either. This stock remains a buy until the company shows its growth is slowing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Wall Street Is Searching for AI Winners Across Emerging Markets",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s biggest money managers are searching for the next wave of artificial intelligence winners beyond the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRBC Fires CFO Ahn After Probe Into Personal Relationship Saudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neom Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Turkey Joins NATO Allies in Suspending Europe Arms Treaty Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Exceeds Elon Musk’s for the First Time Since 2020\n\nAt a time when the global euphoria about AI has propelled a three-fold surge in Nvidia Corp. and a 50% jump in a key US index for semiconductor manufacturers in less than a year, investors are pointing toward emerging markets for better value and a bigger pool of options.\n\nThe asset management arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it’s looking specifically for stakes in the manufacturers of AI supply-chain components, such as cooling systems and power supplies. JPMorgan Asset Management favors traditional manufacturers of electronics that are morphing into AI leaders, while investment managers at Morgan Stanley are betting on players where AI is reshaping business models in non-tech sectors.\n\n“We see AI as a growth driver in emerging markets,” said Jitania Kandhari, deputy chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “While we have previously invested in direct AI beneficiaries like semiconductors, going forward it will be key to look for companies in different industries that are adopting AI to enhance earnings.”\n\nAI stocks are already leading a $1.9 trillion rebound in emerging markets this year, with Taiwanese and South Korean chip companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix Inc. accounting for 90% of the gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nDespite this rally, most emerging-market AI stocks still offer far better value than their US peers. While Nvidia trades at 35 times its projected earnings, Asian AI giants are typically valued between 12 and 19 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloping markets also offer faster growth. Analysts see a 61% increase in earnings for emerging-market technology companies as a whole, compared to the 20% rise that they were penciling in for US peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSo far, the stars of the show are those companies which already were technology leaders prior to the AI rally, such as TSMC and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.\n\nThe duo and MediaTek Inc., also a chipmaker, feature in a JPMorgan single-country fund that invests in Taiwanese equities and has outperformed 96% of more than 1,400 peers. The three stocks are also among the top-10 holdings of the iShare MSCI EM Ex-China ETF, which has doubled in value over the past five months.\n\n“The tech companies that have historically been the suppliers to the big names, may well emerge as the big players themselves,” said Anuj Arora, head of emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The early adaption of this technology means these companies are far ahead of their competitors in leveraging newer evolutions.”\n\nStill, the buzz is widening and more investors are pouring in money.\n\nFor example, Korea’s Hanmi Semiconductor Co., majority-owned by billionaire Kwak Dong Shin’s family, has surged about 120% this year for the best gains among members of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It as also seen its share of foreign ownership increase in recent weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn Vietnam, IT services provider FPT Corp. has jumped almost 20% this year, lifting the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund as the best performer among actively managed emerging market funds in the US.\n\nFor EM-focused exchange-traded funds, more than half of all inflows this year have gone into the iShares MSCI EM ex-China ETF, whose top 10 holdings include companies that are investing in AI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nElsewhere, established businesses have attracted fresh investor interest after signaling that they’re moving into AI.\n\nSaudi Arabia is becoming a hotbed for Chinese AI ventures, such Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud partnership with Saudi Telecom Co.\n\nIndia’s Reliance Industries Ltd., the petroleum giant run by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has developed a chatGPT-style model with capabilities in 22 Indian languages. The company is also part of the digital transformation in the country of 1.4 billion people.\n\n“We would point to the potential ‘national champions’ mindset that is developing around AI in some markets,” said Luke Barrs, global head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs. “Countries are focused on fostering homegrown companies that can be future leaders.”\n\nThe trade is not without its risks.\n\nEmerging markets are tied closely to the US, meaning that an AI selloff could echo across the world. Alternatively, if stock-market gains broaden out, then other sectors may catch up and AI names could lag behind.\n\nStill, investors are increasingly finding EM alternatives to US tech stocks that have over-extended themselves, said Morgan Stanley’s Kandhari.\n\n“In emerging markets, they are seeing AI as an under-appreciated driver going forward,” she said. “There’s a lot of low-hanging fruit to juice there.”\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nIn Brazil, March inflation data will offer clues on whether the central bank can dial down its hawkish message, according to Bloomberg Economics. In Argentina, inflation has probably decelerated for a third month in March. Mexico’s headline inflation will likely rise in March, with non-core food and energy prices accounting for most of the advance. Central banks in Philippines, Thailand and South Korea are scheduled to announce rate decisions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stunning stock rally is not showing any signs of slowing down. Shares of the graphics card specialist have shot up 78% in 2024 so far, and that's not surprising considering the terrific fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 report the company delivered in February.\n\nThe semiconductor bellwether's results crushed estimates and its guidance exceeded expectations, suggesting that its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered growth is here to stay. However, investors who haven't bought this stock yet, or are thinking of adding more Nvidia shares to their portfolio, may be wondering if it is a good idea to buy it following the stunning gains it has clocked in 2024.\n\nLet's examine whether Nvidia stock is worth buying right now.\n\nWhy Nvidia's red-hot growth is here to stay\n\nNvidia stock's rapid rise in the past year has led some on Wall Street to express concerns that it may be in a bubble. However, investors shouldn't forget that the shares' outstanding gains have been backed by solid growth in revenue and earnings.\n\nIt finished fiscal 2024 with $60.9 billion in revenue, a 126% increase over the previous year. Earnings rose at an even faster pace of 288% to $12.96 per share, driven by the low manufacturing costs and high prices of Nvidia's popular H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) that's used for training large language models.\n\nNvidia is anticipating $24 billion in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 at the midpoint. That would be a 233% increase over the prior year. For the full year, analysts are expecting Nvidia to deliver just over $111 billion in revenue, which would be an 82% jump over the previous year.\n\nHowever, Nvidia management's estimate that its total addressable market opportunity could hit $1 trillion in the long run suggests that its business still has a lot of room to run higher. Of that $1 trillion end-market opportunity, the company sees $100 billion coming from the gaming business and $300 billion from the data center segment. I'll focus this discussion on these two segments for the sake of brevity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe gaming business has multiple catalysts\n\nNvidia's gaming segment generated $10.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, an increase of 15% year over year. There are a few impressive catalysts in gaming that explain why Nvidia sees a $100 billion market opportunity here.\n\nThe first is the need for gaming hardware such as discrete GPUs. Market research firm TechNavio predicts that the gaming GPU market could clock an annual growth rate of more than 16% between 2022 and 2027, adding incremental revenue of just over $30 billion during this period. Nvidia controls 80% of the discrete GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research, which puts the company in a solid position to corner a large chunk of this incremental revenue opportunity.\n\nThe second catalyst for Nvidia's discrete GPUs will be the rapid adoption of AI PCs. That's because advanced AI PCs are expected to be powered by dedicated GPUs that Nvidia sells so that they can run AI workloads locally. Nvidia is already offering AI-focused PC graphics cards, and its early move into this nascent market could pave the way for solid growth in this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, cloud gaming could open up another opportunity for Nvidia. As per third-party estimates, the cloud gaming market was worth just $5 billion in 2023. However, it is predicted to generate annual revenue of $143 billion in 2032. Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service ended 2023 with an estimated 9 million users, giving it a market share of 30%.\n\nIf Nvidia continues to hold onto its share of this potentially lucrative market in the long run, it could see a massive jump in gaming revenue. All of this indicates that the company's addressable opportunity within gaming is indeed sizable and its dominant presence in this market should lead to substantial growth in revenue from last year's levels.\n\nNvidia is just getting started in this $300 billion market\n\nNvidia's data center business generated a record $47.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, increasing an impressive 217% year over year. Just like the gaming segment, Nvidia enjoys a terrific market share in this niche as well, which means that it is on pole position to make the most of the $300 billion addressable opportunity it sees here.\n\nWells Fargo analysts claim that Nvidia's share of the data center GPU market stands at a whopping 98%. Even if that may seem a bit optimistic, a closer look at how Nvidia's nearest data center GPU rival is faring will make it clear just how dominant the company is in this space. Advanced Micro Devices is expecting at least $3.5 billion in data center GPU sales this year, while Nvidia generated more than 10 times the revenue from this segment in the previous fiscal year.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia is significantly stepping up its game in data center GPUs with its upcoming Blackwell processors. The company claims that its next-generation data center processors are going to be at least 2.5 times more powerful than the current-generation Hopper offering in terms of computing power. Given that the upcoming chips are expected to be priced competitively when compared to the existing flagship H100 processor (in a range of $30,000 to $40,000), they are likely to help Nvidia maintain its strong position in this lucrative market.\n\nAll of this explains why Japanese investment bank Mizuho expects Nvidia's AI revenue to jump to a whopping $280 billion in 2027. As such, there is a good chance that it will be able to corner a bigger share of the $1 trillion revenue opportunity it claims to be sitting on. That's the reason why it is still a good time for investors to buy this high-flying AI stock. Plus, Nvidia shares are trading at an attractive 35 times forward earnings right now, which is a discount to their five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the darling of Wall Street for a while. The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023, and so far this year, its shares are up around 80%.\n\nBut analysts don't expect this sizzling momentum to continue. The consensus price target for Nvidia is barely above its current share price. Here are three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Wall Street thinks will soar more than Nvidia over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a laggard in 2024. It even lost the spot as the biggest company in the world, based on market cap, to Microsoft. However, analysts are more bullish about Apple than any other Magnificent Seven stock right now.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Apple reflects an upside potential of over 9%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April, 32 rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The others recommend holding the stock.\n\nIt might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26.\n\nAnalysts, though, could be anticipating a catalyst with Apple's June developer conference. The company is widely expected to unveil its generative AI strategy at the event.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't delivered Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns. However, the e-commerce and cloud services leader nonetheless pleased investors with a gain of 80% last year and a 20% jump so far this year.\n\nWall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nGenerative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) jumped 58% in 2023. The stock is up over 10% year to date in 2024. Like Apple and Amazon, Alphabet still has more room to run in Wall Street's view.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nAlphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business.\n\nWhy Wall Street could be right\n\nYou can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too.\n\nNvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds.\n\nWall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says Magnificent Companies Can Become Disappointing Stocks. Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "The fear of missing out -- aka, FOMO -- can lead to shocking excesses on Wall Street. So-called bubbles can push stocks so high that you start to believe that the sky's the limit. Right now, it looks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) can do no wrong, and its share price has risen accordingly. If you pay attention to Wall Street history, however, you'll see that buying Nvidia today could easily end up being the wrong call.\n\nNvidia's stock gains have been incredible\n\nThe big story with Nvidia is that it makes high-powered chips capable of running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. AI is a huge story today in the technology sector, with just about every company that can do so either directly working on an AI product or explaining to investors how AI will be a direct benefit to it in some way (by increasing efficiency or automating tasks, for example). Wall Street is highly enamored of AI and anything associated with it. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGiven Nvidia's direct connection to the space -- and its surging earnings from it -- the stock has advanced rapidly. Over the past year alone the stock has gained 223%. Over the past three years, the gain is more than 550%. Over the past five years, its gain is more than 1,860%. NVDA Chart\n\nScan the 10-year price chart above and it looks like Nvidia's stock is lifting off like a rocket. The combination of that price rise and the general AI fever has investors clamoring to buy it. But don't jump on this rocket without considering some Wall Street history.\n\nBen Graham's Depression-era wisdom\n\nBenjamin Graham is the man who helped to train Warren Buffett and the author of iconic investing tome The Intelligent Investor. To paraphrase that Wall Street giant, even a good company can be a bad investment if you pay too much for it. A great example of that is Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO). Take a look at the graph below. CSCO Chart\n\nIt would be hard not to notice how similar its rocket-like trajectory is to the Nvidia graph above. But the key feature of this graph is actually not the stock price -- it's the dates. The graph ends with the last trading day of 1999. The next graph brings the story up to the present, and it should be more than enough to frighten any investor who is currently all-in on Nvidia.\n\nStory continues CSCO Chart\n\nSimply put, after that giant peak during the dot-com boom there was a giant crash during the dot-com bust. And Cisco's share price still hasn't recovered all of the ground it lost. If you bought near the peak, you are still in the red on your investment (not factoring in dividends being reinvested).\n\nYou can argue that this is a cherry-picked example, which is true. But there are no crystal balls on Wall Street, and there's no way to know for sure that Nvidia will avoid a similar fate. Indeed, while it has a dominant position now in the chips that support AI, competitors are working hard to catch up. When they do, Nvidia may not be quite so special anymore, and investors will probably sour on the shares. The history of Wall Street suggests that, at some point, Nvidia's shocking stock price rise will end, just like it has for so many other stocks before. TSLA Chart\n\nDon't forget about gravity\n\nFew companies can defy gravity forever. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares, for example, have fallen by roughly 50% since the electric vehicle giant became sustainably profitable around 2020 and are down nearly 60% from all-time highs reached in late 2021. That might seem counterintuitive, but stories are often more powerful on Wall Street than profits. And when a story gets old, lofty stock prices have a painful habit of crashing back down to earth.\n\nDon't let FOMO get the better of you. Nvidia may be a magnificent company, but it could still end up being a terrible investment if you pay too much for it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recorded more than 220% returns in the last twelve months, mainly due to the AI explosion. The company’s upward trajectory could be running out of steam.\n\nHigh-profile investors are starting to cash out. The company’s old rivals, like Intel, are also starting to produce AI chips. The then-GPU maker is now facing significant competition as everyone wants a piece of the market. And it will only get tighter going forward. This is why some investors seek stocks offering better growth than Nvidia.\n\nSo with a market brimming with tech companies touting AI-adjacent products and services, how can one make a decent pick? I think it’s wiser to look into companies with tried-and-tested formulas or ones that present a compelling picture of their future, like these three.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has come a long way and become a tech powerhouse. It’s mostly known as the alternative to Nvidia in the GPU market and Intel in the CPU market.The company’s operation data center segment oversees its key products. Those include its server CPUs, AI accelerators, graphic processing units and accelerated processing units.\n\nAlso, AMD’s latest Instict MI300X GPUs are seeing market exposure. Late last year, Microsoft announced that it would use the chip for its accelerated virtual machines. This can be another growth avenue for AMD.\n\nMeanwhile, 2023 was a slight off-year for the company. Full-year revenue and gross profit decreased 4% and 1%, respectively. Fiscal year 2024 predictions also remain flat to negative, which might not incite much confidence from investors.\n\nAdditionally, AMD is playing catch-up with Intel and Nvidia regarding market share for CPUs and GPUs/data centers. However, the company is no stranger to this position. It has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to recover with significant market share boosts.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyzen’s launch is a testament to that, boosting AMD CPU coverage from the low 20s to nearly 40% in half a decade. On the AI front, the company is expanding its offerings, including announcing the Ryzen 8040 Series mobile CPU and the Ryzen 8000G Series for desktops. Both are integrated with neural processing units for AI workload acceleration.\n\nWhile most investors wouldn’t see it winning head-to-head with Nvidia right now, its promise for growth is a different story.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGPU and CPU chips aren’t the only things in demand. External memory chips are also crucial, especially for larger neural networks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is tackling the AI boom with its high-performance memory products and is a leader in memory and storage solutions.\n\nIts HBM3E memory helps accelerate the growth of AI with its lightning-fast data access of 1.2 terabytes per second bandwidth. It operates at a 30% lower power consumption than other competitive offerings. HB3ME is so good that it has sold out its supply for 2024 and most of its 2025 supply, signifying its product’s superiority to its market competition.\n\nFurther, the company’s products were so well received that it reached revenue of $5.82 billion for Q2 of 2024. That is significantly higher than its $3.69 billion for the same year-ago quarter. GAAP net income ended at $793 million, a turnaround from its previous year’s GAAP net loss of $2.31 billion.\n\n“Micron delivered fiscal Q2 results with revenue, gross margin and EPS well above the high-end of our guidance range — a testament to our team’s excellent execution on pricing, products and operations,” said Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO.\n\nFinally, MU anticipates continued growth, driven by the demand for AI and tight supply dynamics in the semiconductor industry. The company is still on the road to recovery after its massive ban from China last year. So, if you are in the market for stocks offering better growth prospects than Nvidia, this is it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMostly known as Supermicro, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a high-performance server specialist that offers application-optimized servers and storage systems for various enterprises.\n\nWhile the company may not be as big as Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise on a global scale, it is uniquely positioned due to its long-standing partnership with Nvidia for its dedicated AI servers and the wave it brings in the growing trend.\n\nWhile some may think that Supermicro is riding the coattails of the GPU giant, I certainly disagree. Its application-optimized servers and Nvidia GPUs help pre-trained models fine-tune and improve decision-making and response times for AI inference solutions.\n\nThis was a strong combination, as its latest quarterly financials reported a 103% year over year (YOY) growth in net sales, which amounted to $3.66 billion.\n\nAlso, SMCI’s net income reached $296 million, nearly double that of the previous year. CEO Charles Liang attributes the company’s exceptional performance to the increasing demand for its AI computer platforms and Total IT Solutions.\n\nIn terms of outlook, SMCI expects revenue for fiscal year 2024 to be between $14.3 billion and $14.7 billion, adjusted higher from the previous announcement. With its strong growth and robust AI product offerings, it’s no wonder investors view SMCI as one of the stocks offering better growth than Nvidia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "280 Billion Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) data center business grew at an eye-popping pace in the previous fiscal year. The company dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards, which are being deployed in huge numbers by major cloud computing and AI companies.\n\nData center revenue jumped a whopping 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) to $47.5 billion. If you're wondering how much room Nvidia's data center business has to run going forward, analyst Vijay Rakesh of Japanese investment bank Mizuho recently explained why he believes this segment's red-hot growth is far from over.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue could multiply from here\n\nAccording to Mizuho, Nvidia's data center revenue in the current fiscal year could jump 87% to about $89 billion. More importantly, Rakesh predicts Nvidia's data center revenue could jump to $280 billion by 2027 (which will coincide with the bulk of the company's fiscal 2028).\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's data center revenue could increase at an annual rate of 56% over the next four years, and there is a good chance it could indeed hit that mark.\n\nThis impressive growth will be driven by the ramp-up of Nvidia's new chips. The company is set to launch the H200, B100, and B200 AI chips in 2024 and 2025. Customers are already lined up to get their hands on these processors.\n\nThe H200, for instance, will be available from the current quarter. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle are expected to launch cloud instances powered by these chips this year, according to Nvidia. Meanwhile, these cloud computing providers have also expressed interest in Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI processors, which the company claims are set to deliver huge performance and efficiency upgrades over the Hopper architecture it launched a couple years ago.\n\nThe Blackwell products should be available \"starting later this year,\" and the company claims \"Amazon Web Services, Dell Technologies, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI\" are among the many companies expected to adopt this platform. That wouldn't be surprising as Nvidia is promising its Blackwell platform can allow organizations to \"build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the likes of Microsoft reportedly looking to spend a humongous $100 billion on building massive AI-focused data centers, it is easy to see why Nvidia is expecting robust demand for its upcoming offerings. Management explained on the latest earnings call that it expects \"next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\n\nNvidia has been bolstering its supply chain with support from its foundry partner TSMC. The waiting time of its current-generation flagship, the H100, has dropped to 3 to 4 months from the earlier waiting period of 8 to 11 months. With TSMC aiming to at least double the packaging capacity of its advanced chips this year, followed by further expansion in 2025, the supply of Nvidia's next-generation chips should continue to improve.\n\nAs such, Nvidia could live up to Mizuho's prediction for $280 billion in data center revenue in 2027. It is worth noting Rakesh expects the overall AI data center market to generate $400 billion in revenue by that year, which means Nvidia would control 70% of the market, down from its current share of more than 90%.\n\nHow much upside can the stock deliver thanks to the data center boom?\n\nNvidia generated $13.1 billion of revenue from its other segments (gaming, professional visualization, and automotive) last year. Assuming these other segments see zero growth and deliver the same amount of revenue in fiscal 2028, Nvidia's top line could still reach $293 billion in four years based on Mizuho's outlook.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at 37 times sales, a premium to its five-year average sales multiple of 18, thanks to the stunning growth it has delivered in the past year. Assuming Nvidia trades at even 15 times sales in four years, its market cap would increase to $4.4 trillion based on the above revenue outlook, doubling from its current level.\n\nBut Nvidia's other segments are not stagnant. The company is growing at a nice pace in the gaming market, which presents another solid growth opportunity thanks to AI. So it could even exceed the projections outlined above and deliver stronger upside for investors. All in all, Nvidia's data center supremacy suggests the stock is built to outperform the market long term, making it a top AI stock to buy even after the stellar gains it has clocked in the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Bearish On These 10 Stocks in April",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 10 Stocks in April. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5 Stocks in April.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC urged investors not to take the Federal Reserve’s policy statements and comments “seriously.” Cramer said it has now become a routine that whenever the Federal Reserve officials “blather”, people try to make sense of their every word to get clues about rate cuts and treat their comments as “gospel.”\n\n“I can’t take it anymore,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that most of the time these comments signify “nothing” and they aren’t that “consequential.”\n\nCramer was blunt about this matter and said that because many Fed officials can’t keep their “trap shut,” people keep trying to take hints from their comments about the possible number of rate cuts. Cramer said this leads to guessing games even though these comments don’t give us insights at all. He said many Fed members talk about two or three rate cuts and then wait and see how things “play out.”\n\nCramer, however, said that Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments matter. He said that as long as we have rate cuts “in front of us,” the number and timing of these rate cuts do not matter.\n\n“What matters is that the Fed wants to be our friend, that’s the takeaway,” Cramer added.\n\nCramer said that nobody knows when rate cuts would begin. Investors, he said, should instead focus on finding buying opportunities in the market since he thinks the period before the beginning of rate cuts is “nirvana” for stocks. The CNBC host said the idea that stocks cannot go higher without rate cuts is just “patently false.”\n\nAccording to Jim Cramer, what matters here is whether there is any need to cut rates at all. He said the latest jobs report was strong which means the economy is “humming” and the consumer remains strong. He thinks the Fed does not need to do anything at the moment and we are entering the earnings season with a strong consumer.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cramer is urging investors to buy companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) in the current environment for long term, there are some stocks he's bearish on. In this article we'll cover some of those. Jim Cramer is Bearish On These Stocks in April\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC recently and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. With each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nCramer does not want investors to buy or hold mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). In a recent program, Cramer said that this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.”\n\nIn its latest earnings call the company talked about important business updates and guidance:\n\n\"The fourth quarter marked a decided shift in Fed policy expectations and fixed income market sentiment. The shift in sentiment was led by favorable inflation data and was ultimately reinforced at the December Fed meeting with a reset of market expectations for a series of rate cuts in 2024. The path to the Fed’s December pivot was anything but a straight line. October was a continuation of extraordinary interest rate volatility, persistent higher for longer rhetoric from the Fed, and weak performance across most all fixed income asset classes as the 10-year treasury note yield broke through 5%. Market sentiment, however, improved materially in November following downside inflation data surprises and generally more balanced messaging from the Fed regarding the outlook for monetary policy and inflation.\n\nIn response to this improving outlook and with equity markets near all-time highs, fixed income investor sentiment turned in favor of adding duration, which in turn caused interest rates to rally and spread products to outperform. Agency MBS across the coupon stack outperformed treasury and swap-based hedges with lower and middle coupons performing somewhat better than higher coupons. Hedge composition was also a significant driver of performance during the quarter as swap spreads tightened 10 basis points across the curve, 2s through 10s. As a result, an MBS position with treasury-based hedges performed meaningfully better than a swap-based hedge position. Our portfolio increased slightly from $59.3 billion to $60.2 billion as of December 31.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\n“You do not want to be in that stock,” Cramer said about Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) when asked about the company by a caller who was wondering whether he should hold on to Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) and wait for a rebound.\n\nRocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT), which provides mortgage lending, title and settlement services, is down 9% so far this year.\n\nCramer is bearish on RKT but recommends buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\nIn February, during an earnings call, the company's management talked about how AI could shape Rocket Companies' business:\n\n\"With AI, we are rewriting the rules of the game and structurally and fundamentally changing how this industry operates. Our mortgage origination has long been associated with inefficient up and down hiring cycles. Because of that, scale profitability has been notoriously difficult to achieve in the mortgage industry because that volatility and cyclicality have made it challenging to adequately plan ahead and invest for the future. The industry has traditionally staffed up rapidly to handle higher volume in upmarkets, only to reduce staff and respond to down markets. So those who don’t manage capacity or liquidity effectively may be acquired or exit the industry altogether. And in 2023 alone, we saw this. We saw the industry with 62 M&A transactions, exits and bankruptcies, and recent data shows that capacity is down nearly 35% from the peak.\n\nWe believe AI will shape the future of the home buying industry and Rocket leading the way. Technology is the answer to better client experiences and capacity management in our industry. We aim to redefine the home buying experience through AI and deliver market share growth, scaled revenue growth and profitability. I will share with you that automation and AI are being aggressively deployed across Rocket, helping us to deliver better client experiences at scale across the entire home-buying process. Now I’m going to share three examples of how AI is driving impact today across mortgage banking, underwriting and servicing. Purchasing a home can be an overwhelming process, which is why at Rocket, we excel in blending personalized service with cutting-edge technology.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call guidance here.\n\n8. Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nCloud services company Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. When asked about Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) recently on his program on CNBC, Cramer said that Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is not one of this favorites and he cannot back the stock.\n\n“I’m not going to endorse that stock.”\n\nCramer might not be backing this stock, but 23 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database did have stakes in Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) as of the end of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $23 million stake in Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY).\n\n7. Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nWhile talking about the Dogs of the Dow on his recent program, Cramer said that his charitable trust owns Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL) but “that’s been a mistake.” In February, Cramer said that Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL) is down and not every stock in his portfolio is a winner.\n\nIt’s important to note that back in March 2023, Cramer was highly bullish on Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL). He tweeted:\n\n“UBS says sell Footlocker, if you do this please remember to invite me to your funeral.”\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on Foot Locker, he's urging investors to buy and hold Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\n6. Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) on his program on CNBC. While Cramer praised Under Armor Inc Class C's (NYSE:UA) founder Kevin Plank, he said that Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) is in a “cutthroat business” with many companies, including Nike, struggling.\n\n“It’s a doggy dog world that Kevin finds himself in and it’s a tough situation for anybody.”\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA).\n\nUnder Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) shares are down about 24% over the past one year. Kevin Plank is returning as Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) CEO, replacing Stephanie Linnartz.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5 Stocks in April.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Has crypto-skeptic Dave Ramsey changed his tune when it comes to Bitcoin? Here’s what he told a recent caller\n\nNearly 16 years after it was created, Bitcoin continues to divide investors and financial pundits alike. On one side, major corporations and financial institutions have added this volatile asset to their operations. On the other side, financial gurus and market veterans remain as skeptical as ever.\n\nDave Ramsey has firmly established a spot in the latter camp. He has previously described crypto assets as “risky” and “stupid investments,” often mocking investors and advising his audience to stay away from this segment of the market.\n\nDon't miss\n\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) Jeff Bezos told his siblings to invest $10K in his startup called Amazon, and now their stake is worth over $1B — 3 ways to get rich without having to gamble on risky public stocks\n\nWhich is why viewers of The Ramsey Show were surprised to hear Ramsey strike a more measured tone in recent comments about the crypto asset. Here’s what he said.\n\nBitcoin is a currency\n\nJason from Connecticut wanted to know Ramsey’s thoughts on Bitcoin, given its recent rebound. Each unit of world’s most famous cryptocurrency is currently trading at $67,459 — roughly four times higher than its value in late 2022.\n\n“An asset with a trillion-dollar market cap is not a beanie baby,” Jason said in his email to Ramsey. Surprisingly, Ramsey didn’t aggressively push back as he has in the past on this question about crypto assets. Instead, he struck a more measured tone.\n\n“Bitcoin is a currency,” Ramsey admitted, seemingly agreeing with some of the most loyal members of this community. However, Ramsey went deeper into his explanation: “Currencies have no value except for their track record that indicates that two people are willing to fight over them,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe compared BTC to other major assets such as the yuan and Japanese yen. However, he was quick to point out that major global currencies were backed by the economic power of their issuing countries and had much longer track records. “Of all the currencies, Bitcoin has the least faith,” he laughed. “Someday, it may level out and become a thing, but Jason, it’s not there.”\n\nHe predicts that the asset will continue to be volatile and that he wouldn’t invest in it for the same reason he wouldn’t invest in “the Iraqi dinar.” Ramsey and his co-host argue that Bitcoin is not an “investment” because it doesn’t produce cash flow. “I wouldn’t wish bitcoin investments on somebody I really dislike,” Ramsey said, perhaps proving he hasn’t changed his stance on the asset.\n\nWarren Buffett and his business partner, the late Charlie Munger, had a similar argument — “[Bitcoin] is a gambling token and it doesn’t have any intrinsic value,” Buffett once said.\n\nWith this in mind, investors may have better opportunities within asset classes that generate tangible income.\n\nRead more: Suze Orman says Americans are poorer than they think — but having a dream retirement is so much easier when you know these 3 simple money moves\n\nBetter investment opportunities\n\nBased on the principle that cash flow is the key to a good investment, sophisticated investors like Buffett and Ramsey have always preferred real estate and stocks.\n\nHowever, perhaps traditional value investors and cryptocurrency advocates can both agree that chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) provides some value. During the previous crypto bull run, Nvidia saw a boost in earnings due to a scramble for its GPU units that were ideal for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nNow that Bitcoin is rallying again, Nvidia could see a similar boost. However, this time the boost is supercharged by the ongoing artificial intelligence battle. Tech giants are spending billions of dollars to secure the company’s H100 chips, which are a key resource for their large language models.\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, Nvidia generated $29.7 billion in net income, which means it’s profitable enough to attract the attention of traditional investors who may be skeptical of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Bought 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, and 1 Is Up 142% Already",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023. It has added $1.8 trillion in value since then, and it's now the third-largest company in the world behind only Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe heightened interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is the primary driver of that value creation. Nvidia makes the industry's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their AI models. Those chips drove Nvidia's data center revenue to more than triple in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), and the momentum looks set to continue in fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia is now using some of its newly acquired wealth to invest in other AI companies, which could hint at where the next wave of AI value is created. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia bought five AI stocks at the end of 2023\n\nNvidia filed its first-ever 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, and it publicly revealed new holdings in five different stocks:\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI technologies. Arm Holdings, which designs processors for the world's largest chip companies. This was Nvidia's largest investment with a value of $147 million at the end of 2023. Nano-X Imaging, which is improving patient outcomes by using AI to enhance medical imaging. This stock was Nvidia's smallest investment with a value of less than $0.4 million at the end of 2023. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which is using AI to help with drug discovery. TuSimple Holdings, which developed an autonomous driving platform for the trucking industry.\n\nSoundHound AI stock has been the best performer of the bunch so far, with a 142% gain in 2024 already. It values Nvidia's stake at around $8.7 million, which doesn't sound like much, but SoundHound is only a $1.5 billion company.\n\nSo should investors follow Nvidia into the conversational AI specialist?\n\nSoundHound has a growing portfolio of AI products\n\nMost of us are familiar with AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. They were originally designed to ingest text-based prompts, and they are capable of generating text content, images, videos, and computer code on command. SoundHound focuses on conversational AI, which is designed to recognize voice-based prompts and respond in kind.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat opens up a range of possibilities, especially in use cases where hands-free functionality is required. For example, restaurant chains use SoundHound's Employee Assist technology to help workers get fast answers to questions in high-pressure situations, like when they might be serving customers or completing operational tasks.\n\nSimilarly, SoundHound's technology is popular with automotive manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, which use it to power their in-car virtual assistants. It means drivers can instantly retrieve information about their vehicle's functionality, in addition to weather forecasts, sports results, and information about local restaurants (to name a few capabilities).\n\nSoundHound recently announced a new partnership with Nvidia's Drive platform, which will allow car makers to deliver AI on the edge. That means drivers won't need network connectivity to use their voice assistant, which makes it available in more places and enhances data privacy.\n\nThe Drive platform is Nvidia's end-to-end solution for car manufacturers wanting to install autonomous self-driving capabilities into their new vehicles. Drive could become a key distribution channel for SoundHound's technology over the long term, considering it already serves many of the world's leading car brands. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nSoundHound generates little revenue, and large losses\n\nSoundHound brought in $45.8 million in revenue during 2023, which was a 47% increase compared to 2022. The company is still in the scale-up phase, although it did finish last year with a $661 million order backlog -- and that number doubled from the end of 2022.\n\nManagement's forecast for 2024 points to around $70 million in revenue, which would represent an accelerated growth rate of 54%.\n\nThat's great news, but SoundHound's bottom line warrants some concern in the near term because the company lost $91.7 million last year. While it's normal for small technology companies in their growth phase to lose money, SoundHound only has $95.2 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so it can't afford another year like that in 2024.\n\nRisk-averse investors shouldn't follow Nvidia into SoundHound stock\n\nThe financial picture outlined above makes SoundHound stock a risky investment relative to other AI stocks like Nvidia or Microsoft. There is a strong possibility the company will need a cash injection within the next year or two to continue operating, and that creates uncertainty.\n\nWith that said, Nvidia's investment in SoundHound stock is a big vote of confidence, and it could breed more unique deals like the one with its Drive platform. Plus, SoundHound's order backlog could lead to accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nBut remember this: Nvidia's stake in SoundHound is only worth $8.7 million. If it went to zero, it would have virtually no impact on the $2.2 trillion chip giant. It would be the equivalent of someone with a net worth of $100,000 losing $0.39 -- yes, 39 cents.\n\nNot only does the average investor have fewer resources than Nvidia, but they might also have a very different risk appetite. Therefore, buying SoundHound stock should be reserved for investors with a stomach for volatility, and the potential for losses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF)-owned Foxconn that manufactures iPhones that are the apple of the eye of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its first quarter results. With the first quarter being a typically quiet period, it comes as no surprise that Foxconn posted a revenue dup. However, Foxconn is expecting revenue growth in the second quarter despite it still being an off-peak season.\n\nFirst quarter highlights\n\nFor the first quarter, Foxconn posted a 9.6% drop in revenue, however, Apple supplier noted that its cloud and networking segment reported significant revenue growth. But total revenue amounted to 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars which equates to about $41.2 billion and it was also 28.58% lower compared to the previous, fourth, quarter. But, fourth quarter is usually when suppliers race to enable tech giants like Apple to satisfy the holiday demand. But, according to Counterpoint Research, overall shipments if smartphones declined 3.2% during 2023.\n\nThe AI hype is in the air\n\nAlthough Foxconn is behind AI chipmaking leader, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), it still has gained momentum of late.\n\nView more earnings on HNHPF\n\nAs a reminder, Foxconn teamed up with Nvidia last year. Foxconn and Nvidia joined class to develop certain “AI factories” which are a new class of data centers that use Nvidia chips to power all kinds of applications ranging from large language models to training autonomous vehicles. Also, Foxconn will develop smart solution platforms that are based on technologies that Nvidia developed. By gaining access to Nvidia’s solutions, Foxconn will get to offer safe AI-powered EVs and make its mark in the new era. In simple words, Nvidia joined forces with Foxconn on its path to accelerate the AI Industrial Revolution. Considering that AI development requires more than chips, there is room for all kinds of industrial contributors as even the all-mighty Nvidia cannot do everything alone, which bodes well for Foxconn.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the traditional off-peak period and a recent earthquake, higher March revenue from consumer-electronics and cloud demand fueled Apple supplier to expect revenue growth in the second quarter. Also, Foxconn shares rose almost 21% year-to-date.\n\nRebound hopes are based on AI\n\nAlthough the sales slump offers little hope for the rebound of the Apple star, the iPhone, , the growing demand for AI servers empowered Foxconn to expect a revenue rebound in the second quarter and be optimistic for the year ahead.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang launched his company in a booth at Denny’s with his friends. Meet his cofounder who donated shares now worth $70 billion and moved off the grid",
        "content": "Nvidia, now one of the world’s most valuable companies with a $2.2 trillion market cap, was formed in an unexpected place. Exactly 31 years ago today, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem met at a Denny’s restaurant, where Huang had once worked as a dishwasher and busboy.\n\nWhile Huang has been the face of the world’s premiere advanced chip manufacturer, the company’s other two cofounders still played an important role in Nvidia’s success. Priem served as the chief technical officer for a decade before retiring in 2003—and he could’ve been the 16th-richest person in the U.S. if he hadn’t sold most of his shares in Nvidia after it went public in 1999.\n\nIndeed, if Priem had held on to all of his shares, he’d be worth $70 billion, according to a Forbesreport, but he’s only worth an estimated $30 million as of November 2023. Priem is the forgotten cofounder of Nvidia mostly due to his early retirement, stock sellout, and move off the grid—but he is a remarkable inventor with almost 200 U.S. and international patents as well as a philanthropist who has donated hundreds of millions of his fortune to causes he cares about.\n\nHow did Priem get involved with Nvidia?\n\nPriem got his start in electrical engineering at IBM and Sun Microsystems, where the programming language Java was invented. Both Priem and Malachowsky were working at Sun Microsystems when they met with Huang at what was one of Denny’s “most popular” locations in Northern California to discuss “creating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,” according to an Nvidia blog post.\n\n“Chris and Curtis said one day they’d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they’d like me to go figure out what they’re going to leave for,” Huang said during a recent interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.”\n\nEarly on, Priem architected the blueprint that allows engineers to design algorithms for Nvidia’s chips, according to Forbes. These chips now power a slew of technology including AI systems and video game graphics. Because Priem was very much the technical lead behind Nvidia’s original chip designs, it’s no surprise that he stayed in the shadows as the company grew in popularity—and market value.\n\nStory continues\n\n“There was a saying at Nvidia to never put Curtis in front of a camera, and never put Curtis in front of a customer,” Priem told Forbes.\n\nWhy did Priem abandon Nvidia?\n\nBy 1999, Nvidia went public with a $1.1 billion market cap, and just months later he established the Priem Family Foundation. Priem put more than three-quarters of his 12.8% (at IPO) Nvidia stake in the foundation. In today’s share count, that would’ve been about 100 million shares. Nvidia declined a Fortune request for comment on Priem’s involvement with the company and why he sold off his shares and retired.\n\nBy 2006, Priem had sold all of his shares in Nvidia and gone off the grid, moving to a $6 million home in Fremont, Calif., according to Forbes. Now he’s just focused on writing “manifestos” on solving problems such as “repairing the earth,” although none have been published anywhere.\n\nBecause Priem has essentially run out of money from selling all of his Nvidia shares and going off the grid, his foundation, which once donated to causes including the Nature Conservancy, holds about $160 million in assets and is set to shutter by 2031, according to Forbes.\n\nBut a massive share of his wealth went to his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he has donated $275 million since 2001, which accounts for 40% of RPI’s total gifts during that time period.  RPI didn’t respond to requests for comment from Fortune regarding Priem’s donations, which have gone to projects at the school including a new concert hall.\n\nAlthough Priem’s continued involvement with RPI became his “purpose and my sanity,” he still has regrets about selling his Nvidia stock.\n\n“I did a little crazy thing,” Priem told Forbes. “And I wish I'd kept a little bit more.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Is Nvidia or Super Micro Computer the Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock?",
        "content": "In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, few stocks have been better recently than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). These two have had a phenomenal 2024 so far, with Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) up over 250% and Nvidia up by 80%.\n\nBut that performance becomes even more impressive if you backdate to the start of 2023, as Supermciro and Nvidia are up an astounding 1,160% and 520%, respectively. That level of performance might have investors wondering if there's room for more. If there is, the next obvious question is, \"Which one should I buy?\"\n\nSo, between the two, which is the better AI stock to buy today? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia and Supermicro work together\n\nThese two companies aren't competitors; they are complementary. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) -- computing hardware that specializes in effectively processing intense calculations. These devices have been used for gaming graphics, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, AI model training, and practically every other use that would require significant computing power to process.\n\nFortunately for Nvidia, most users (besides gamers) don't just have a single GPU. They buy hundreds or thousands of them and connect them to form supercomputers often housed in servers at a data center.\n\nHowever, haphazardly linking them together will not result in an optimized computing experience, which is where Supermicro comes in.\n\nSupermicro specializes in server design and has separated itself from competitors by offering highly customizable products that can be designed for workload type and size. Furthermore, Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its servers have been designed in an optimized manner so the end-user gets the most use out of their product.\n\nThis brings up the first difference: Supermicro has less differentiating technology. While Nvidia's GPUs are market-leading, Supermicro relies on industry knowledge and customization to separate itself from competitors. This can be a sustainable advantage, but it's less sustainable than having superior technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother difference is that Supermicro is essentially an Nvidia reseller. It takes Nvidia's GPUs and other components to make its servers and then sells them to its clients. Because it cannot control the GPU pricing (the most significant cost of the server), Supermicro's margins are much slimmer than Nvidia's. SMCI Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nOnce again, this is just a differentiating factor. Plenty of businesses have succeeded with much lower margins.\n\nBut when it all adds up, my lean starts to go in Nvidia's direction due to its technological prowess and higher margins. Additionally, when I look at each stock's valuation, Nvidia also looks to have an advantage there.\n\nSupermicro's stock has gotten very expensive\n\nAfter these two stocks' incredible runs, valuing them can be difficult. Trailing metrics aren't useful, as they are still undergoing massive changes (both Supermicro and Nvidia grew revenue by over 100% in their latest results). As a result, I'll use a forward-facing metric like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the companies.\n\nForward metrics have their issues, as they utilize analyst projections to value a company, which isn't an exact science. Still, it's arguably the best way to value these businesses, but Supermicro certainly comes with a price premium over Nvidia on this basis. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis makes sense, as Supermicro's boom is just beginning, while Nvidia's is starting to mature (even though Wall Street analysts project nearly 100% revenue growth this year).\n\nWith Nvidia's stock trading at a lower level (and thus lower expectations to meet) than Supermicro's, I think there's no doubt that Nvidia is the superior AI stock. That's not to say that Supermicro is a bad stock, as it will likely continue to succeed due to its strong product offering and customization. However, the valuation bar is a bit higher for Supermicro, so I'm giving the nod to Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold Nvidia and Alphabet Shares Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. Here Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers.\n\nHe correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest.\n\nIt raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA changing of the guard\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.\n\nThe sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million.\n\nIn this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead\n\nIn moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.\n\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.\n\nThe company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.\n\nAnd with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.\n\nA timely investing lesson\n\nSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.\n\nThere's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.\n\nInfluential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 4, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The tech industry has a reputation for delivering significant, consistent gains over the long term, and for good reason. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index outperformed the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 over the last decade, proving the value of holding tech stocks over many years. ^NDXT Chart\n\nThe tech market is an ever-expanding space, encompassing everything from consumer products to video games, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and much more. The constantly evolving nature of tech allows companies to profit from reliable demand for upgrades to various hardware and software products.\n\nAs a result, it's no surprise that Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, dedicated almost 50% of its portfolio to the high-growth industry. Meanwhile, the company's portfolio posted a nearly 20% compound annual gain from 1965 to 2023 and is now worth $371 billion.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's success shows it's never too late to invest in tech and profit from its long-term growth. So here are two hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nChipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been featured in countless headlines over the last year after becoming the poster child for a boom in AI. In 2023, the company cornered the market on AI chips, achieving an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), while rivals like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices scrambled to catch up.\n\nNvidia's success in the sector has seen its earnings hit record heights from quarter to quarter, with growth showing no signs of slowing. In its fourth quarter of 2024 (which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The meteoric rise was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's -$14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed the company further ahead, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months. NVDA Price to Free Cash Flow ChartData by YCharts\n\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics, as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAlongside a powerful position in a budding market like AI, Nvidia is a hypergrowth tech stock worth considering in 2024.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable investment options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, translating to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).\n\nConsistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model as the home of potent brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn. The success of these services has granted Microsoft leading roles in operating systems, productivity software, cloud computing, and even social media.\n\nMeanwhile, its annual revenue has risen 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft is on a promising growth trajectory. It is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and AI. The company's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term. In fact, the tech giant hit a new height this year, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company by achieving a market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft's earnings could hit just over $15 per share over the next two fiscal years. When multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 36, you get a stock price of $561. Considering its current position, this projection would see Microsoft shares rise 33% by fiscal 2026, outperforming the S&P 500's 15% increase over the last two years.  MSFT EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nThis, in addition to a powerful position in tech and years of reliability, means Microsoft is a screaming buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy.\n\nWith the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines.\n\nA potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.\n\nMatching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Many investors find it difficult to buy into a stock after it has already made a big run higher. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) certainly fits into that category. Its shares have soared by an astounding 515% just since the start of 2023.\n\nThat's because its data center business has exploded with the onset and growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI applications continue to roll out, and Nvidia is the leading supplier of platforms for the high-performance computing power it requires.\n\nNvidia's sales explode\n\nNvidia's stock thundered higher as revenue in its data center segment mushroomed. The segment generated $18.4 billion in revenue for Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended Jan. 28. That compares to $15 billion from that business segment for the entire fiscal year 2023. So it shouldn't be a surprise that the company's stock price also took off.\n\nThat monumental increase in share price has some investors wondering whether they missed out, and is it too late to buy Nvidia stock. But those sales also translated into profits. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the most recently reported quarter soared by 765% year over year. And there are good reasons to believe more is to come.\n\nBeyond the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nNvidia's chips have been in such high demand across so many industries and geographies that the company has had to prioritize certain customers. The high-growth technology stocks with the deepest pockets -- part of the group dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- have been at the front of the line. The chart below shows the tech companies that spent the most to buy Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) last year. Image source: Statista.\n\nBut uses for AI are growing, and the technology is still in its early stages. At Nvidia's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) last month, CEO Jensen Huang said the first accomplishment has been to \"close the technology divide,\" allowing the average person to use the technology. The next accomplishment will likely entail broadening the supply to more buyers for more industry uses.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext-generation AI technology\n\nThat same conference is where Nvidia introduced its latest AI technology. Its new Blackwell AI platform is expected to be used by automakers, for advanced data center and cloud infrastructure, and other generative-AI supercomputing needs. So buyers of Nvidia stock now will see more sales to a growing list of customers.\n\nAnd as for missing out on the stock's big run, just look at how its valuation has changed with the burst of sales and increasing profits. Even as the stock has jumped more than 500%, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped. NVDA Chart\n\nThat downward valuation trend for Nvidia stock is bound to continue as its financial results continue to surprise investors to the upside. It is the leader in a rapidly growing space. It seems clear the demand is there.\n\nIn this situation, investors shouldn't think they have missed out on the gains. Nvidia stock might not return another 500% in the next 18 months. But a few years from now, it's likely to still be a valuable holding in any portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Decade Investment Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now -- No, Not Nvidia",
        "content": "Hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb compared artificial intelligence (AI) to the industrial revolution in a letter to clients written last year. The industrial revolution was a characterized by a dramatic increase in economic output as machines replaced human workers. AI promises a similar step-function increase in productivity across virtually every industry.\n\nLoeb wrote, \"We have watched AI evolve and believe the technology has matured to the point that it is driving a transformational technology platform shift similar to those seen roughly once per decade: the personal computer in the 1980s, internet in the 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s.\"\n\nThat puts investors in front of a big opportunity. The most prudent way to benefit is to own a basket of AI stocks. Many investors will naturally gravitate toward Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the company whose chips power the most advanced AI systems. But ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) is a more compelling AI stock at its current price.\n\nNvidia is a wonderful company, but the stock looks expensive\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). The company consistently achieves record-breaking results at the MLPerfs, objective benchmarks that measure the performance of AI hardware and software. Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\"\n\nNvidia delivered an astounding financial performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue soared 265% to $22.1 billion on triple-digit sales growth in the data center, driven by strong demand for AI solutions. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income jumped 486% to $5.16 per diluted share as gross margin expanded over 10 percentage points, driven by pricing power and a scaling software business.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Grand View Research estimates that AI spending will increase at 37% annually through 2030. Nvidia will undoubtedly benefit from that tailwind. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 27% annually over the next five years. But that consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 36.6 times sales look expensive.\n\nTo be clear, I am not recommending that investors sell Nvidia. It is a wonderful company with a history of cutting-edge innovation and excellent future growth prospects. But I am skeptical about its ability to deliver market-beating returns for shareholders from its current price. So investors should consider other AI stocks (like ServiceNow) at the present time.\n\nServiceNow is a leader in workflow digitization and automation\n\nServiceNow helps businesses digitize and automate workflows across departments. Its platform addresses four primary use cases:\n\nTechnology workflows like IT service and IT operations management Customer workflows like field service and customer service management Employee workflows like human resources Creator workflows like software development and process automation\n\nServiceNow is best known as a leader in IT service management, but consultancy Gartner has also recognized its leadership in IT operations management and artificial intelligence (AI) for IT operations. Similarly, Forrester Research sees the company as a leader in low-code application development, customer service solutions, digital process automation, and risk management platforms. Those commendations tell investors ServiceNow is doing something right, but they also cue potential customers in to compelling products.\n\nServiceNow printed strong financial results in the fourth quarter. Total revenue rose 26% to $2.4 billion, marking the fourth straight quarter in which growth accelerated sequentially. That trend may continue in the future because remaining performance obligation (RPO), which measures momentum in the sales pipeline, actually increased more quickly than revenue. Specifically, RPO rose 29% to $18 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, non-GAAP operating margin expanded about 150 basis points, and adjusted net income climbed 36% to $3.11 per diluted share. That reflects disciplined expense management. ServiceNow also achieved a renewal rate of 99% in the fourth quarter, up from 98% in the prior year, implying a high degree of customer satisfaction.\n\nServiceNow has tailwinds in digital transformation and artificial intelligence\n\nGoing forward, digital transformation (DX) should be a significant tailwind for ServiceNow. International Data Corp. estimates that DX spending will compound at 16% annually through 2027 as businesses digitize all manner of processes to improve efficiency. ServiceNow is ideally positioned to benefit from that secular trend, given its leadership in numerous relevant markets.\n\nAdditionally, generative AI should also be a significant tailwind. ServiceNow became one of the first software companies to make generative AI available to its customers when it introduced Now Assist last September. Now Assist is a suite of tools that can automate tasks and improve productivity across IT service, customer service, human resources, and development teams. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI software revenue will increase at 58% annually through 2032.\n\nServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott commented on those tailwinds during the most recent earnings call:\n\nWhat we have here is a strong, durable market being supercharged by a once-in-a-generation secular trend. ServiceNow has been investing, innovating, and preparing for this wave for years, which is why we're catching it so early. Artificial intelligence is injecting new fuel into our already high-performing growth engine.\n\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects ServiceNow to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 17.4 times sales is tolerable. Investors with a five-year time horizon should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar Another 14% in 2024: 2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before That Happens",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 index rose nearly 54% in 2023. Even better, it started the first quarter of 2024 with additional gains of more than 8% so far. The index currently sits at 18,226, and history suggests that it will end at a higher level by the end of the year. According to data collected by brokerage firm Capex.com, the Nasdaq-100 has clocked average gains of 24.1% in the year following one in which it recorded gains of more than 40%. The only exception to this is the year 2000 when stocks fell over multiple years during the dot-com bubble.\n\nAssuming history does repeat in 2024, the Nasdaq-100 could end the year at a level of 20,880 (which is 24.1% higher than last year's close). Based on the index's current reading, the Nasdaq-100 could jump another 14.6% this year if it follows the average.\n\nThat level of growth is why now could be a good time for investors to buy shares of Confluent(NASDAQ: CFLT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), two Nasdaq stocks that have been in fine form on the market this year. Let me explain.\n\n1. Confluent\n\nShares of Confluent have jumped more than 26% so far in 2024, driven mainly by the company's impressive results for the fourth quarter of 2023, which were released in February. Wall Street appreciated the company's better-than-expected numbers, as its revenue increased 26% year over year to $213 million. Even better, Confluent swung to an adjusted profit of $0.09 per share as compared to a loss of $0.09 per share in the same period last year.\n\nWhat's even more impressive was Confluent's guidance. The company -- which provides a data streaming platform with which customers can process and use their data in real-time instead of storing it in silos for processing later -- also provided solid guidance. Confluent is forecasting $950 million in revenue for 2024, which points toward an increase of 22% and is higher than the Wall Street estimate of $940 million.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Confluent expects adjusted earnings to increase to $0.17 per share this year from $0.04 per share in 2023. A closer look at the company's business will tell us just why its bottom line is set to increase at a much faster pace than its revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nConfluent's customers have increased their spending on the company's products, which means that it is getting more money from each customer. This is evident from the 24% year-over-year growth in the number of customers with $100,000 or more in annual recurring revenue (ARR) to 1,229 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the number of customers with $5 million or more in ARR jumped to 19 from nine in the same period last year.\n\nConfluent ended fiscal year 2023 with a customer count of almost 5,000. This bodes well for the company's revenue pipeline, as customers who use its solutions for longer periods tend to spend more money on its offerings. For instance, a telecom company that gave Confluent $400,000 worth of business in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased its ARR to $5.9 million in Q4 2023. Similarly, a Fortune 50 bank increased its spending by 12 times from the second quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nConfluent predicts that its addressable market could increase to $100 billion in 2025 from $60 billion in 2022. As such, it won't be surprising to see Confluent sustaining its solid growth over the next few years, which explains why analysts expect its earnings to increase at a nice pace. CFLT EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWhat's more, consensus estimates are projecting Confluent's earnings to increase at an annual rate of almost 124% for the next five years. All this indicates that Confluent could turn out to be a solid pick for investors looking to buy a growth stock and, given the solid form that it is in right now, it would be a good idea to buy it before it soars higher.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nWith Nvidia's shares up 81% so far this year thanks to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered growth in revenue and earnings, investors may think it's too late to buy Nvidia right now. However, the stock is trading at 35 times forward earnings. That's lower than Nvidia's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39.\n\nBuying Nvidia at these multiples could turn out to be a smart move considering its terrific pricing power in AI chips, which is expected to result in outstanding growth in its earnings. The following chart indicates that Nvidia is expected to clock impressive bottom-line growth in the current and the next couple of fiscal years as compared to its adjusted earnings of $12.96 per share in the previous fiscal year. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIt reportedly enjoys a market share of 92% in AI GPUs (graphics processing units), and its current flagship H100 processor sells for $25,000 to $30,000. Investment banking company Raymond James estimates that it costs $3,320 for Nvidia to make a single H100 chip. So, it was not surprising to see Nvidia's adjusted earnings increasing 288% in fiscal 2024 to $12.96 per share.\n\nNvidia's upcoming Blackwell B200 processors are expected to cost $6,000 to build, according to Raymond James. With Nvidia expected to sell each B200 for $30,000 to $40,000, the company's earnings power should improve further once these chips hit the market.\n\nAs a result, analysts raised their earnings expectations for Nvidia. In the past 30 days, 10 analysts covering Nvidia increased their earnings target for fiscal 2025, while 13 raised their expectations for fiscal 2026. TechNavio estimates that the data center GPU market which Nvidia dominates could clock an annual growth rate of over 32% through 2028, setting the stage for Nvidia to maintain its robust earnings growth.\n\nThrow in the possibility of Nvidia making big money from other AI hardware-related markets such as personal computers, and the possibility of the company consistently outperforming consensus expectations cannot be ruled out. So, buying this AI stock before it jumps further could turn out to be a smart move -- it may not only benefit from the growing demand for AI chips, but the Nasdaq index's rally could rub off on it as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Overvalued Stocks Insiders are Dumping Now.\n\nWise investors almost always keep track of corporate insider activity because paying attention to insider sentiment has proven to be a successful strategy several times in the past. For example, when markets were wavering amid the coronavirus crisis, insiders started piling into stocks like crazy in March 2020. In just about 20 days insiders bought $1.19 billion in company shares. Later events proved that they were right. Markets were quick to roar back to new highs driven by stimulus packages and rising consumer spending. Insiders were also selling in November 2021, when the Federal Reserve was getting ready to start cutting interest rates.\n\nTracking Insider Buying and Selling: Performance Through the Years\n\nBut should you always look towards insider sentiment to guess what’s coming next. Are insider bets always right?  Some data points show that if you keep paying attention to insider sentiment without incorporating outlier or black swan events, you’d face surprising results. In January 2023, for example, the Wall Street Journal said in a report that insiders were not expecting a rebound because they weren’t buying shares of their own companies. The Journal’s analysis at that time was based on insider buying to selling ratio which ticked up in June 2022 but then started to decline without any major increases. The report at the time also cited Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, who was worried that insiders were not buying despite prices coming down to very low levels. Seyhun said that this indicator was a “warning” about things to come. The WSJ report also said that insider sentiment started to decline in November and December 2021 since in these two months shares of “almost twice as many companies were sold by insiders as were bought.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut were insiders right? The S&P 500 at the end of January 2023, when insider sentiment was down, was at 3,824.14, while it ended the year at 4,769.83. The AI-led rally that surprised the financial markets was really an outlier event and we are still seeing its effects without any end in sight.\n\nSimilarly, in May 2022, insiders were brushing aside recession warnings and piling into stocks. Bloomberg, citing The Washington Service, at the time reported that 1,100 corporate executives and officers had bought their company shares in May through May 23. The S&P 500 closed the month of May at 4,132, while at the end of the year it was at 3,893.\n\nWhat's the Insider Sentiment in April 2024?\n\nCurrently, the overall Insider Buy/Sell ratio is 0.23, which is quite low and shows that insiders are not bullish on the short-term future. And this isn’t unexpected. Many analysts are expecting a wider market pullback in the short term since they believe the AI-led rally has gone too far and stocks need a breather. They have been questioning the valuations of large-cap tech stocks. Some analysts however believe the AI rally would now broaden to smaller companies.\n\nIs Following Insider Buying and Selling Profitable in 2024?\n\nLet’s take a look at how insider sentiment-focused investing strategies have been performing in the recent past. AdvisorShares Insider Advantage ETF (SURE), which invests in companies “reducing their equity float through buyback programs and insider buying,” is up 10.6% year to date, compared to the 8.5% gain posted by the S&P 500 in the same period. Over the past one year the ETF is up 30%.\n\nAnother testament to the effectiveness of keeping an eye on insider trading is the returns posted by Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. The portfolio returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nWhich Sectors are Seeing Insider Buying and Selling These Days?\n\nInsider Monkey’s analysis of insider buying and selling activity over the past few days shows that insiders are dumping technology stocks in droves. Out of the 83 important insider selling transactions since the start of this month, 26 were related to technology companies. When it comes to insider buying, financials stocks took the lead with 29 insider buys over the past week, followed by healthcare. This was also expected since analysts have been recommending investors to look beyond technology stocks and pile into healthcare, financials and utilities amid low valuations and rate cut expectations.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "While innovators have flourished this year thanks to artificial intelligence and other advancements, it may seem difficult to find the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. After all, the ecosystem has garnered so much attention that many companies command rich premiums.\n\nHowever, the market features thousands of opportunities. And even specific sectors feature a wealth of possible ideas. It’s just not possible for Wall Street experts to cover them all. So, it’s definitely reasonable – with some digging around – to find underappreciated gems.\n\nOf course, you’ll have to accept a higher risk profile. If you’re okay with that, these are the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nListed under the semiconductor equipment and materials segment of the tech ecosystem, Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) engages in the manufacture and sale of photomask products and services in the U.S. and other countries. Per its public profile, the company offers photomasks that are used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) and flat-panel displays (FPDs). It also specializes in transferring circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers.\n\nWhile most of the spotlight centers on the “front-facing” semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), investors should look into what goes on behind the scenes. Essentially, companies like Photronics keep the show running smoothly, making it a strong candidate for most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April.\n\nCurrently, PLAB stock trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 12.78X. Also, it trades at 1.95X trailing-year revenue. Both stats are undervalued compared to their sector median values. Further, analysts project that in fiscal 2024, Photronics should enjoy decent earnings and sales growth.\n\nD.A. Davidson is currently the only analyst that covers PLAB stock, assigning a “buy” rating (but without a price target).\n\nStory continues\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) Shipping label of a box from Himax. HIMX stock.\n\nSource: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock\n\nAnother semiconductor enterprise, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor enterprise that provides display-imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan and many other nations. The company operates in two segments: Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. Mainly, it focuses on display driver ICs and timing controllers used in televisions, laptops and automotive solutions, among many other applications.\n\nAgain, Himax isn’t exactly what you call a front-facing enterprise. However, it’s absolutely critical in the smooth running of the tech space, especially consumer electronics. Still, Wall Street isn’t exactly giving HIMX its dues. That means right now, shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 18.72X, below the sector median 32.8X.\n\nOn the top line, HIMX trades at only 0.98X trailing-year sales. That seems very low considering the broad relevancies. To be fair, analysts are only looking for earnings growth in fiscal 2024 while they anticipate negative growth in revenue. For top-line expansion, investors may have to wait until fiscal 2025.\n\nStill, a lone analyst rates HIMX a buy with a $7 price target. That seems more reasonable based on the underlying utility. It’s one of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April.\n\nViaSat (VSAT) An image of a phone cropped to display the logo for Viasat, Inc. (VSAT)\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nConducting business in the communication equipment space, ViaSat (NASDAQ:VSAT) provides broadband and communications products and services worldwide. According to its corporate profile, ViaSat’s Satellite Services segment offers satellite-based fixed broadband services, including broadband internet access and voice over internet protocol services to consumers and businesses. It also offers in-flight entertainment and aviation software services to commercial airlines and private business jets.\n\nUndoubtedly, VSAT is one of the riskiest ideas in terms of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. Since the start of the year, shares succumbed to 41% worth of red ink. In the past one-year period, it’s down almost 52%. Still, if the economy happens to march forward, ViaSat could potentially see increased demand.\n\nHere are the stats. Shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 2.18X. As for the revenue multiple, we’re talking about 0.45X. Both stats are subterranean compared to the industry. However, the intriguing aspect is that analysts see fiscal 2024 revenue landing at $4.22 billion, up 65.3% from last year’s print.\n\nAlso, they peg VSAT as a moderate buy with a $32.20 price target, implying 95% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The technology industry has outpaced nearly another market sector within the last year and has added a tremendous amount of growth to the S&P 500. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is considered a benchmark for the tech industry, which has grown by 37% within the last year. The ever-advancing field of generative AI and other innovative technology, such as cloud computing and increased semiconductor production, has led the technology industry down a path of immense profitability.\n\nHere are a few investment options within the tech industry that have performed very well recently. They are also strong buy stocks that could continue to grow throughout 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is primarily a technology infrastructure company that offers storage and server systems such as full racks, blade servers, security software, subsystems, and rack-mount servers. Its products are used in data centers, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market over the past year, growing nearly ninefold during that time due to increased earnings growth and a surge of investors flocking to companies that provide new and innovative tech, especially within the cloud computing and generative AI industries.\n\nOn Jan. 29, SMCI released its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in which it stated that total revenue more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and net income rose by 68% compared to the previous year. Management reported that the anticipated revenue for SMCI in the third quarter of FY 2024 is between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion.\n\nEarlier last month, it was announced that Super Micro Computer would be added to the S&P 500 following its scheduled rebalance. SMCI replaced Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR). This move further legitimizes Super Micro Computer as a strong company with further upside potential, which makes it a great option for investors in 2024, even after its impressive share price growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NADSAQ:APP) is an application software company that provides an advertising infrastructure platform with products such as MAX, Spark, AppDiscovery, SparkLabs, Array, and Adjust.\n\nSimilar to SMCI, AppLovin has received plenty of positive attention for its involvement in innovation within the generative AI space, which has brought tremendous growth.\n\nOn Feb. 14, APP repotted earnings results for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that it beat analyst expectations for total revenue, which increased by 36% year-over-year. Its earnings per share were forty-nine cents per share, which beat by fourteen cents per share. In a press release, AppLovin reported a secondary offering of common stock by KKR Denali Holdings of nearly 20 million shares. It has also announced a share buyback program of $570 million worth of shares.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has more than quadrupled, with continued growth expected due to its strong positioning within the rapidly growing tech industry. It is a solid pick for investors looking for greater exposure within companies that have profited heavily from the expansion of generative AI.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a producer of semiconductor-related equipment. It offers wafer cleaning equipment and electrochemical plating technology.\n\nACM Research is still surprisingly considered an undervalued company, especially in the realm of many other semiconductor-related stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which have experienced growing popularity and a large increase in overall share price.\n\nOn Feb. 28, it reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, which stated that net income increased by 64% year-over-year. ACMR also beat analyst predictions for revenue by $21 million and earnings per share by twenty-six cents per share.\n\nACM Research is a strong buy stock within the semiconductor industry. Its share price has more than doubled within this last year, primarily due to its outstanding earnings report for the fourth quarter, which immediately, upon release, propelled its share price by over 40%. It is poised for continued growth with revenue guidance for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $750 million, topping the full-year 2023 results of $558 million by at least 17%.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position in APP.

The growing proliferation of UWB devices is expected to be assertive to Keysight’s top line in the long run.\r\n\r\nKeysight boasts a robust 5G portfolio. Its 5G product design validation solutions, ranging from Layer 1 to 7, enable telecom and semiconductor companies to accelerate their 5G initiatives. Apart from strength in the 5G domain, the company is expected to benefit from the growing proliferation of electronic content in vehicles, momentum in space and satellite applications and rising adoption of driver-assistance systems globally.

Baillie Gifford Bolsters Stake in Mobileye Global Inc\n\nMobileye Global Inc: Driving the Future of Autonomous Technology\n\nMobileye Global Inc, headquartered in Israel, has been at the forefront of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies since its IPO on October 26, 2022. The company's comprehensive suite of software and hardware solutions is designed to meet the evolving needs of autonomous driving. With a market capitalization of $26.65 billion and a current stock price of $33.058, Mobileye has shown a promising IPO performance, with a 23.77% increase since its market debut.

While Mobileye's current financial metrics present a mixed picture, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s decision to bolster its stake may be indicative of the firm's belief in the company's potential to overcome current challenges and capitalize on the opportunities within the autonomous driving industry.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "We’re at a crossroads in this current market. Tech and growth stocks continue to soar while undervalued stocks lag. That dynamic has been in play for some time. However, the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks continue to steal the spotlight away from other very profitable and high-growth companies worth considering. Several companies could produce much better growth than most of the Magnificent 7 stocks. Here are three growth stocks with greater potential than the Magnificent 7, that investors may not want to sleep on.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter peaking at around $225 per share, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has certainly given up some of this year’s gains. Now that the trade is below the $180 per share level, cooler heads have prevailed, and investors are now wondering whether it is time to consider building positions in the #2 chip player position in the U.S.\n\nThe fact that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has absolutely overshadowed AMD is no surprise. It remains a stock I’m bullish on, partly due to the company’s recent Blackwell GPU release and its other AI innovations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe thing is, I think the overall AI chip market is big enough for both players. AMD forecasts $3.5B in revenue from MI300 GPU, signaling substantial growth. Analysts predict a 20-30% market share in AI data center GPUs, bolstered by competitive pricing. Additionally, AMD’s AI-compatible CPUs for PCs offer significant growth prospects.\n\nMoreover, renowned leaks suggest AMD’s Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs could be 40% faster than current models. Details on the impending desktop processor battle are scarce, but sources anticipate significant performance gains for AMD’s next-gen chips.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock hinges on confidence in Salesforce’s new focus on profit margins and generative AI. Despite Q4 earnings exceeding estimates, fiscal 2025 revenue guidance fell short. However, one upside is that the company will be giving out its first dividend and share buyback plans, signaling that now is a good time for investors to buy and hold this stock for the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnticipated revenue growth in 2024 is picking up, but Salesforce is working on improving efficiencies simultaneously. The company reported it cut 10% of its workforce last year, highlighting management’s goal of improving profitability. Analysts predict further job cuts as this trend continues. Additionally, the company ceased merger exploration, signaling no significant acquisitions are likely on the horizon. This likely means greater cash flow, which should bleed into a higher CRM stock over time.\n\nAdditionally, rising corporate digital spending benefits Salesforce, known for subscription-based sales, marketing, e-commerce and data analytics software. As the software market continues to see solid growth, this is one of the top ways to play this space, in my view.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nSurging more than 130% in 2023, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) currently has more upside, according to analysts. The consensus average price target on LLY stock is $845, implying more than 10% upside from current levels. That’s a reasonable estimate, given the company’s dominant position in the weight-loss drugs market.\n\nThe recent approval of Zepbound, among the leading weight-loss drugs, positions Eli Lilly as a company to be contended with in this space. This is a pharma giant with phenomenal growth potential, with earnings per share expected to soar more than 97% this year. Looking to next year, these estimates come in at a still-high 45%. That kind of growth can drive meaningful multiple expansion over retime.\n\nPharmacies continue to encounter supply challenges with Eli Lilly’s GIP/GLP-1 obesity drug, Zepbound, due to “unprecedented” demand. That said, that’s a good thing, at least for investors. This outsized demand should lead to considerable profits as the company scales production. Despite not being on the FDA’s shortage list, pharmacies nationwide struggle to maintain stock. This is a trend that’s likely to continue for some time, though investors would like the company’s production to meet demand at some point soon.\n\nLLY stock isn’t cheap by any stretch. However, this company has some solid long-term secular catalysts supporting its valuation. So, for now, this is a stock worth holding onto for at least the next 12 months for investors looking for outperformance in their growth portfolios.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Incredible Surge? This Could Be the Next Big Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, With Potential Gains of 100%, and It Is Incredibly Cheap Right Now",
        "content": "The critical role that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) plays in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology thanks to the massive computing power of its graphics processing units (GPUs) explains why the company witnessed an outstanding surge in its revenue and earnings in recent quarters.\n\nIn its recently concluded fiscal 2024, revenue was up 126% to $60.9 billion. In the current fiscal year, analysts expect another stellar revenue gain of 96% to $110.6 billion. Meanwhile, analysts expect the company's bottom line to double this year, though it could outperform on that front, as it enjoys immense pricing power in the AI GPU market.\n\nAll of this suggests that Nvidia should be able to justify its expensive valuations. It trades at 75 times trailing earnings, but the forward earnings multiple of 35 tells us just how rapidly its bottom line is expected to grow. What's more, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) stands at just 0.13. A PEG ratio of less than 1 is viewed as indicating that a stock is undervalued with respect to the growth it is expected to deliver.\n\nHowever, cautious investors who have doubts about Nvidia's growth story may not be comfortable buying it at these valuations after the 225% surge that the stock saw in the past year. But for investors looking to buy a value play in the AI space right now, Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) looks like an ideal stock pick.\n\nDell Technologies has a couple of solid AI-related catalysts\n\nDell's business consists of two segments. The first is infrastructure solutions, through which the company sells storage and server solutions along with networking products and services. The second segment is client solutions, which includes sales of workstations, personal computers (PCs), and other peripherals.\n\nThe good news for Dell investors is that both these segments are on track to win big from the rising adoption of AI.\n\nThe company's infrastructure business is getting a nice bump from sales of AI servers, which are used for mounting chips from Nvidia and others. In the fourth quarter of Dell's fiscal 2024 (which ended Feb. 2), its infrastructure solutions segment delivered $9.3 billion in revenue. Though that was a drop of 6% year over year, it was a gain of 6% sequentially thanks to the growing demand for AI-optimized servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell shipped $800 million worth of AI servers during the quarter, and that metric is likely to head higher as orders for AI servers increased 40% sequentially last quarter, boosting Dell's AI server backlog to $2.9 billion. Its AI server-related order book should keep getting fatter -- according to a forecast from Global Market Insights, the AI server market's revenue will jump from $38 billion in 2023 to $177 billion in 2032.\n\nThe company is already witnessing a \"strong interest in orders\" for next-generation chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which is another indication that its AI-specific server orders are set to move higher.\n\nSimilarly, Dell expects the advent of AI to drive a turnaround in its client solutions business as well, which has been under stress thanks to declining PC sales. Client solutions revenue was down 12% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter to $11.7 billion. However, the sequential decline was just 5%.\n\n\"PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC,\" Dell COO Jeffrey W. Clarke said on the Feb. 29 earnings call. The company already announced a new lineup of commercial PCs with integrated AI functionalities to capitalize on this opportunity. This is a smart thing to do, as shipments of AI-enabled PCs are expected to take off this year.\n\nMarket research firm Canalys predicts that AI-enabled PC shipments will hit 48 million units in 2024, 100 million units in 2025, and 205 million units in 2028. Canalys also points out that AI PCs are likely to carry price premiums of 10% to 15% over traditional PCs. Given that Dell is the third-largest PC original equipment manufacturer and controlled just over 15% of this market in 2023, it is positioned to benefit from this fast-growing niche.\n\nThese AI-related catalysts explain why analysts have been significantly raising their revenue growth expectations for Dell of late. DELL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe valuation and the potential upside  make this stock a good buy right now\n\nDell's top-line performance is anticipated to improve over the next three fiscal years, and that revenue growth is expected to filter down to the bottom line as well. DELL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nDell is currently trading at just under 25 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple is even cheaper at 15.7. For comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has a trailing earnings multiple of 31 and forward earnings multiple of 27. Assuming the company does achieve $9.53 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027 and trades at 27 times earnings at that time (using the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $257 in three years.\n\nThat would be a 100% jump from current levels. Dell has already gained 210% in the past year, but don't be surprised to see this tech stock deliver eye-popping gains in the future as well thanks to its improving AI credentials. That's why investors looking to buy a growth stock that's not ridiculously expensive should consider adding Dell Technologies to their portfolios before it surges higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hardware Stocks -- Not Named Nvidia -- That Are Crushing the Market and Are Still Cheap",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have taken off big-time in the past year. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index gained an impressive 51% during this period thanks to the booming chip demand triggered by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nSemiconductors play a central role in the AI revolution. The training of AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT was made possible using chips designed by the likes of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). This explains why Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have been selling like hotcakes over the past 18 months, leading to a sharp jump in Nvidia's revenue and earnings. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe market rewarded Nvidia handsomely for its stellar growth. That's evident from the 225% jump in the company's stock price in the past year. It won't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain its outstanding momentum as well thanks to expectations of strong top- and bottom-line growth. However, Nvidia is not the only company in the hardware supply chain driving the AI revolution.\n\nHere's a closer look at five other names playing a central role in the AI hardware market.\n\nThese server manufacturers are winning big from AI adoption\n\nWhile the likes of Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices make or design chips that are used for addressing AI workloads such as training large language models (LLMs) and for inferencing purposes, those chips need to be mounted on a server infrastructure that's specifically designed for running AI workloads. Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) are two names benefiting big-time from the growing need for AI-optimized servers.\n\nWhile shares of Dell have jumped 184% in the past year, Supermicro stock has rocketed higher, with eye-popping gains of 847%. Despite these massive jumps, both stocks still trade at attractive multiples. Dell has a sales multiple of just 0.9, while Supermicro's reading stands at 5.6. Their sales multiples are lower than the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's average price-to-sales ratio of 7.3.\n\nStory continues\n\nA closer look at how AI drives their growth will demonstrate why investors bought their stocks hand over fist in the past year. It also explains why they are still worth buying. Dell, for instance, is set to return to growth in the current fiscal year after struggling in the previous one because of weak personal computer (PC) sales.\n\nIts top line fell 14% in fiscal 2024 (which ended on Feb. 2, 2024) to $88.4 billion. Dell has guided for $93 billion in revenue in the current year at the midpoint of its guidance range, and the demand for AI servers is one of the reasons behind its turnaround. Dell shipped $800 million worth of AI-optimized servers last quarter. Even better, its AI server backlog almost doubled quarter over quarter to $2.9 billion thanks to a 40% sequential increase in AI server orders.\n\nThe good part is that Dell's AI server order book could keep getting fatter. The AI server market is set to grow from an estimated $30 billion last year to $150 billion in 2027, according to Foxconn. This is precisely the reason why even Super Micro Computer stock has turned out to be a stock market favorite in the past year.\n\nSupermicro's growth has been stunning with its revenue in the ongoing fiscal year 2024 set to double to $14.5 billion from $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023. More importantly, the server manufacturer claims that its production capacity is solid enough to support more than $25 billion in annual revenue. This explains why analysts have significantly raised their revenue estimates for the next couple of years. However, it won't be surprising to see the company crushing those expectations thanks to its capacity expansion moves. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMemory and custom chips also saw a robust AI-driven boom\n\nMemory chips from the likes of Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) are helping Nvidia manufacture powerful AI GPUs. This explains why Micron sold out its entire 2024 capacity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are deployed in AI chips, while also allocating an \"overwhelming majority\" of its HBM production line for next year.\n\nHBM is deployed to increase the speed at which data is fed to AI processors, significantly boosting the performance of AI processors. This explains why Nvidia and AMD have been packing more HBM into their AI chips, driving impressive growth for Micron. The memory specialist's revenue was up 58% year over year last quarter to $5.8 billion. It is expecting stronger growth of 76% in revenue in the current quarter to $6.6 billion from $3.75 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect Micron to finish the year with a 57% spike in revenue to $24.3 billion followed by another impressive year in fiscal 2025 with an estimated revenue jump of 42%. With shares of Micron currently trading at 6.4 times sales despite rising 95% in the past year, buying it looks like a smart thing to do as the HBM market could generate $49 billion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $857 million last year.\n\nAnother chipmaker benefiting from the AI chip market is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), a stock that has jumped 106% in the past year. In February, J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed out that Broadcom is set to become the second-largest AI chip company in 2024 with an estimated revenue of $8 billion to $9 billion thanks to customers such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms for whom it makes custom AI chips.\n\nBut when Broadcom released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results, management said that its AI chip revenue is set to exceed $10 billion in the current fiscal year. However, don't be surprised to see Broadcom exceeding that mark as it recently added a new customer for its custom AI chips. Wall Street analysts believe that the newly added customer could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nIt is easy to see why Broadcom's AI customer pipeline is increasing. Cloud companies are looking to develop custom chips for running AI workloads to reduce costs, consume less power, and improve performance. This explains why Morgan Stanley predicts custom chips will account for 30% of the $182 billion AI semiconductor market in 2027, indicating that Broadcom's addressable market in AI chips could be worth almost $55 billion in three years.\n\nSo, Broadcom's AI business could keep growing at a nice clip moving forward, which is why buying the stock now could be a good idea as it is trading at 28 times forward earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple and lower than Nvidia's reading of 36.\n\nThe bonus pick\n\nAll the above-mentioned names supply AI hardware, but it eventually comes down to electronics manufacturing services providers such as Jabil(NYSE: JBL) to make the end products. This stock is trading up 52% in the past year but recently took a big hit. Savvy investors, however, would do well to take a look at the bigger picture.\n\nFrom designing and sourcing components to assembling the final product, Jabil products and services are deployed to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Not surprisingly, Jabil saw a big surge in AI-related orders. Management pointed out on its recent earnings conference call that its \"AI GPU volume in the first half of 2024 is 200x that of the level of 2023.\"\n\nEven better, Jabil points out that its AI-related revenue is set to increase by 20% in fiscal 2025 to $6 billion. That would be 20% of the company's top line based on the consensus estimate of $30 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025.\n\nJabil's AI business could keep growing in the future as the company claims that it is \"winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space.\" That's why investors would do well to take a closer look at this AI stock that's trading at just 0.5 times sales and 21 times trailing earnings before it steps on the gas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Twenty dollars doesn’t stretch very far today—except when investing in these most undervalued stocks under $20 to buy in April.\n\nWhile inflation growth may be on the decline, the current cost of goods and services is still significantly higher than it was just two years ago. This situation arises because inflation measures ongoing growth rather than actual price differences, contributing to persistently low consumer confidence despite seemingly positive inflation statistics.\n\nMeanwhile, high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are quickly becoming too expensive for retail traders. This is where under-$20 stocks shine. Affordable enough to allow for decent accumulation, each of the most undervalued stocks under $20 to buy in April is poised for rapid growth due to specific favorable conditions and bullish momentum, setting the stage for subsequent success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerimeter Solutions (PRM) Fireman standing in front of fire truck.\n\nSource: VAKS-Stock Agency / Shutterstock\n\nPerimeter Solutions (NYSE:PRM) is one of the most undervalued stocks under $20 to buy in April purely based on its relative anonymity. The company, a specialist in firefighting equipment and crucial fire suppression and extinguishment chemicals has experienced significant growth since 2010.\n\nIn the last year, Perimeter reported a 7.2% CAGR in total addressable market size since 2010 and forecasts it to climb to $100.2 billion by 2027, driven by the steady demand for firefighting equipment. They’re well on their way to growing alongside the wider market, having hit more than $322 million in sales last year.\n\nPerimeter sets a goal to “provide private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market,” and it has successfully achieved this aim. This showcases its potential as a top investment choice for those scouting for stocks under $20.\n\nTrading at a price-to-book ratio of just 0.97x, Perimeter is a unique small-cap value play among undervalued stocks under $20.\n\nStory continues\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is a unique undervalued stock under $20 set to rise with the wider semiconductor tide. AEHR’s business model, focusing on developing and supplying test systems that ensure semiconductor reliability and quality, distinguishes it from both newcomers and established industry leaders.\n\nWith semiconductors becoming tinier, more intricate, and costlier, the demand for advanced testing systems is anticipated to skyrocket. This puts Aehr in an excellent position for substantial growth as a small-cap tech enterprise.\n\nIn January, the company reported impressive financial results, with a 45% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 63% rise in GAAP net income. CEO Gayn Erickson acknowledged potential challenges, like the slowdown in the electric vehicle market growth, which might impact order timings from existing and potential customers.\n\nNevertheless, AEHR’s expertise extends beyond the EV market, encompassing semiconductors for 5G technology, AI, machine learning, and more. Despite potential EV sector hurdles, AEHR is on track for an extraordinary year in 2024 and beyond, thanks to its wide-ranging yet specialized capabilities.\n\nLithium Americas (LAAC) Lithium element on the periodic table. Top-rated lithium stocks\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) is another one of the most undervalued stocks under $20 to buy in April. All after it suffered from a sluggish lithium market in recent months. However, this trend could reverse in 2024, potentially sending the Argentinian-focused mining stock soaring. Demand is expected to increase by over 30% annually until 2030, largely on the heels of battery innovations and an emphasis on renewable energy transitions.\n\nDespite the latent potential, lithium producers, including Lithium Americas, faced challenges in 2023, with slow demand and significant oversupply leading to lower spot prices. However, demand is picking up speed, and some analysts forecast a considerable undersupply within a year, likely elevating spot prices to Lithium Americas’ advantage.\n\nOne investment analyst has compared the importance of lithium and critical minerals in the 21st century to that of coal in the 19th century and oil in the 20th century. That comparison is likely on target, and Lithium Americas, trading below $20, is poised to benefit from the expanding energy segment.\n\nTrading significantly below its book value and at a lower price-to-forward earnings ratio than in recent years, Lithium Americas represents both a solid value investment and a stock with substantial growth prospects.\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) stands out as a strong “nuts and bolts” undervalued stock under $20, manufacturing higher-end office furniture for enterprise clients and remote workers alike. Though I don’t own shares in the company, I am sitting on a Steelcase chair right now and can attest to its quality – if the stock performs as well as this chair, Steelcase has a bright future ahead!\n\nOver the past year, the company has surged nearly 50% and now boasts a 3.06% forward dividend yield. That’s a hefty return for a company with a market capitalization of less than $1.5 billion. Of course, investors on the hunt for undervalued stocks under $20 should not just concentrate on dividends. They should also consider Steelcase’s consistent revenue and its sharply rising net income, which reached $777 million and $30.8 million, respectively, in the latest quarterly report.\n\nLooking ahead, the company’s fiscal year 2025 outlook appears particularly promising as it leverages a more stable economy and ongoing remote work trends. Management has reported a 10% sales increase in just the first three weeks of the fiscal year and aims for 1% – 5% revenue growth with an EPS ranging between 85 cents and $1.00. Given the year-end EPS of 68 cents, the optimistic outlook from executives reinforces its potential as an undervalued stock under $20.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) The Sirius XM (SIRI) mobile app logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen Warren Buffett invests in an under-$20 stock, it catches the attention of investors. This makes Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) a unique offering among undervalued stocks under $20 given the billionaire’s backing. Amid a period where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) was more focused on selling than buying, his $167 million investment in Sirius XM is a green flag for value investors. This is especially notable considering the skepticism surrounding Sirius XM, which is currently one of the most shorted stocks at 25% short interest. But what makes Buffett optimistic about this under-$20 stock?\n\nBuffett’s interest in Sirius XM goes beyond a simple corporate restructuring play; he sees it as a classic value investment. Sirius XM has been trading at low multiples, yet it promises a bright future. The company stands out as a cash-generating powerhouse, consistently achieving EBITDA margins of over 30% for the past four years and maintaining free cash flow above $1 billion during this time. Furthermore, Sirius XM provides a reasonable dividend yield of 4.69% with a payout ratio of 31%, indicating efficient cash management by its leadership to reward shareholders while it right-sizes its market presence.\n\nFlexible Solutions International (FSI) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlexible Solutions International (NYSEAMERICAN:FSI), a small-cap Canadian company specializing in sustainable chemical technologies, is on the lower end of undervalued stocks under $20, trading a hair below $2 a share.\n\nDespite a disappointing performance in November 2023 that pushed per-share pricing down to today’s levels, a closer look suggests this downturn was a one-off anomaly rather than a reflection of systemic issues. With FSI’s next report eagerly anticipated, there’s speculation that the market may have overreacted, potentially overlooking the company’s deep value.\n\nFSI’s standard ratios point to deep undervaluation, particularly its 0.72x price-to-book ratio and 0.59x price-to-sales stat. Further analysis using Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAV/PS) reinforces this perspective, showing that FSI trades close to its liquidation value, underpinning its undervalued stock under $20 position.\n\nSupporting a rosier outlook, FSI demonstrates consistent sales growth, prudent financial management through occasional dividend distributions, and a strong asset-to-debt ratio. Despite facing a challenging quarter, FSI’s management remains optimistic, forecasting a recovery and growth throughout 2024.\n\nValley National Bancorp (VLY) SPY ETF: The S&P 500 Will Go Higher but Investor Patience is Necessary\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLast week, I covered Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY), looking specifically at its potential as a unique play among cannabis stocks amid emerging regulatory developments. But this small-cap regional bank offers much more beyond its cannabis initiatives.\n\nWith its stock trading at just 0.6x book value and 8.2x earnings, Valley National is undervalued and equally overlooked. Its solid balance sheet and relatively low debt load, with a debt-to-equity ratio of merely 0.56 against the industry average of 1.2, reinforce the regional bank’s strength even as others tread on thin ice. Its recent stock buyback plan and a 5.97% trailing dividend yield underscores this capability.\n\nAnalysts generally view Valley National as undervalued, setting an average price target of $9.50, which is about 25% higher than its current share price. Moreover, sentiment towards the bank stock has become increasingly positive, with 56% of analysts recommending a “hold,” up from 50% suggesting a “sell” in the prior assessment period.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said on Wednesday it will invest around $3.87 billion to build an advanced packaging plant and research and development facility for AI products in the U.S. state of Indiana.\n\nThe new plant will include an advanced chip production line to mass-produce next-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, currently used in graphic processing units that train artificial intelligence systems, the Nvidia supplier said in a statement.\n\nMass production is planned to start in the second half of 2028. The new facility in West Lafayette, Indiana will also house a packaging R&D line.\n\nThe facility \"will help strengthen supply chain resilience\" for AI chips in the U.S., CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe engineering talent pool provided by the region's Purdue University, infrastructure for chip manufacturing, and support from the state and local government were factors in the chipmaker's decision, it said.\n\nSK pledged in 2022 to invest $15 billion in the semiconductor industry through R&D programs, materials, and the creation of an advanced packaging and testing facility in the U.S.\n\nLast month it began mass production of the latest version of HBM chips, called HBM3E, with sources saying initial shipments are going to Nvidia.\n\nSK Hynix has been the sole supplier of the version previously used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia, which has 80% of the market for AI chips.\n\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Jan Harvey)",

        "title": "The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter",
        "content": "The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.\n\nThe quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.\n\nSpeaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.\n\nOh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe good\n\nLet’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.\n\nAlso this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US. Nvidia's founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, meanwhile, made headlines for ending its electric car project. According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.\n\nFinally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe bad\n\nThings weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.\n\nThe FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”\n\nThe upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nThe DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball though, and are looking into whether they’re complying or not.\n\nThe hits kept coming for Google during the quarter, after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.\n\nCongress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.\n\nThe ugly\n\nNothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.\n\nFinally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat.\n\nIt’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement. That is to say, the good stories could flip and become bad or ugly and vice versa. On to Q2.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have turned out to be superb investments over the past year thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled demand for their products, which has led to a sharp jump in their revenue and earnings.\n\nWhile shares of Nvidia have gained more than 234% in the past year, Super Micro Computer stock has delivered an even more stunning gain of 855%. Both companies are capitalizing on the booming demand for AI servers although in different ways. Nvidia dominates the market for AI GPUs (graphics processing units) with an estimated share of more than 95%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, on the other hand, makes modular server solutions that are used for mounting AI chips from the likes of Nvidia and other prominent chipmakers. One might argue that Super Micro and Nvidia aren't exactly comparable, but investors should note that both companies are riding on the same catalyst.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro has turned out to be the go-to supplier of AI server solutions for data center operators and cloud computing providers. But can it become a dominant force in AI servers like Nvidia is dominating the market for AI chips? Let's find out.\n\nImpressive growth, becoming a bigger player\n\nIn the trailing 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2023, Super Micro generated revenue of $9.25 billion. Management pointed out on the January earnings conference call that it gets more than half of its top line from selling server solutions related to AI GPUs. So selling AI server solutions represented at least $4.6 billion in revenue. Based on Foxconn's estimate that the AI server market was worth $30 billion last year, it can be assumed that Super Micro controlled just over 15% of this market.\n\nFoxconn predicts that the AI server market could generate $150 billion in revenue in 2027. That would translate into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49%. It is worth noting that Super Micro's revenue is growing at a much faster pace than the estimated growth of the AI server market. Its fiscal Q2 revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $3.66 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Super Micro is estimating revenue of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. The midpoint of that range suggests that the company's revenue will more than double from fiscal 2023's figure of $7.1 billion. So Super Micro seems on track to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\n\nMeanwhile, Super Micro has been laser-focused on enhancing its production capacity so that it can meet the fast-growing AI server demand. The company points out that its production expansion moves now allow it to support an annual revenue capacity of $25 billion.\n\nThat figure looks set to move higher since the company recently decided to raise additional capital through a common stock offering. Though the move would dilute existing shareholders, Super Micro's plan to use that money to enhance its manufacturing capacity would allow it to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\n\nBut can it become the next Nvidia?\n\nNot surprisingly, the stock was upgraded by multiple Wall Street firms recently, which believe that its market share gains are here to stay. Analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an impressive pace over the next five years, outpacing the growth that Nvidia is predicted to deliver.\n\nConsensus estimates suggest that Super Micro's earnings could increase at a 48% CAGR over the next five years. That's higher than the 38% annual earnings growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver over the same period. Moreover, Super Micro stock has already been delivering much stronger gains when compared to Nvidia. Even then, the stock remains attractively valued.\n\nSuper Micro and Nvidia are not very far from each other when it comes to their earnings multiples, be it trailing or forward. This can be seen in the chart below. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhat's more, Super Micro's sales multiple of 5.6 is significantly cheaper than Nvidia's reading of nearly 37. So if the market decides to reward Super Micro Computer with a higher price-to-sales ratio thanks to the eye-popping growth that it has been delivering, it could continue to outperform Nvidia on the market in the future as well.\n\nThat's why investors who have missed Super Micro's surge so far can still consider buying this stock, as its market share gains in AI servers point toward more stock price upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying 2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has created substantial shareholder value in recent months. The stock has soared 517% since the beginning of 2023 amid surging interest in artificial intelligence (AI). But several billionaire hedge fund managers sold down their positions in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, while purchasing other AI stocks.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%. David Tepper of Appaloosa sold 235,000 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 23%.\n\nThose three billionaires have two important traits in common. They rank among the 15 most successful hedge fund managers in history, and they beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past three years. Those qualities lend them credibility.\n\nWith that in mind, all three hedge fund managers bought shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the fourth quarter. Englander and Tepper also started positions in HubSpot(NYSE: HUBS). Those companies have already achieved a strong presence in certain AI markets -- Amazon in cloud AI developer services, and HubSpot in AI sales assistant software -- but both are leaning into AI product development in a way that could create more shareholder value.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is working from a position of strength in all three markets. To elaborate, Amazon runs the most-visited online marketplace in the world, which has naturally made it the largest retail advertiser in the world. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, as well as several subcategories, including artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.\n\nAmazon is leaning into AI to improve its standing in all three markets. It recently launched a generative AI shopping assistant called Rufus, and it uses machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes for its logistics business. Amazon also introduced a generative AI tool that creates marketing content for advertisers, and the company continuously tweaks its machine learning models to make product recommendations more relevant.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, AWS has made its cloud platform more compelling with two new products: Bedrock is a service for customizing large language models and building generative AI applications, and Amazon Q is a generative AI business assistant that queries and summarizes data from various internal and external sources. CEO Andy Jassy believes generative AI alone will create \"tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nAmazon reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion, operating margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter, and non-GAAP net income improved to $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\nGoing forward, Amazon has a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. I say that because retail e-commerce sales are forecasted to increase at 8% annually, the digital advertising market is expected to expand at 15% annually, and the cloud computing market is projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030.\n\nWall Street analysts have similar expectations. The consensus calls for Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years. That makes its current valuation of 3.3 times sales appear reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in this stock today, especially as part of a larger basket of AI stocks.\n\n2. HubSpot\n\nHubSpot specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its platform includes applications for marketing, sales, customer service, and operations teams, as well as tools for commerce and content management. Those products help businesses generate leads, convert leads into customers, and maintain lasting relationships with those customers.\n\nHubSpot designed its CRM platform with small and medium-sized businesses in mind. Customers in that underserved market segment find its user-friendly interface, simple software, and freemium pricing attractive. As a result, HubSpot has achieved a strong presence in several product categories, especially sales and marketing software. Indeed, Morningstar sees HubSpot as a leader in both spaces, and IT consultancy Gartner recently recognized its leadership in marketing automation software, highlighting investments in AI as a key differentiator.\n\nHubSpot delivered a solid financial report for the fourth quarter, surpassing expectations on the top and bottom lines. Its customer count climbed 23% to top 205,000, while the average subscription revenue per customer increased one percentage point. In turn, revenue rose 24% to $582 million, due to especially strong momentum in sales software, and non-GAAP net income increased 53% to $98 million.\n\nGoing forward, HubSpot aims to drive adoption of higher-end products by adding more sophisticated functionality and engaging larger businesses. To accomplish that, the company is rolling out a slate of AI capabilities during the first half of this year, most of which are exclusive to more expensive product tiers. Those capabilities include predictive AI for sales forecasts and content recommendations, as well as generative AI for marketing copy and content summaries.\n\nWall Street expects HubSpot to grow sales at 17% annually during the next five years, but that estimate leaves room for upside. HubSpot is a recognized leader in AI sales assistant software for small businesses, and ongoing investments in AI could be a powerful growth driver. That said, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales seems reasonable even if the Wall Street consensus is correct. Now is a good time for long-term investors to buy a small position in this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion's share of the heavy lifting has been done by the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have taken Wall Street to new heights\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%. MSFT Chart\n\nThe second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter. Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in April: Meta Platforms\n\nAmong the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.\n\nBut there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta.\n\nAs noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta.\n\nSomething that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in April: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not all Magnificent Seven members are poised to be winners moving forward. The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nSomething else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace.\n\nAs I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers.\n\nRegulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nLast but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Now or Wait for a Dip?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a growth machine recently. Revenue and profits are through the roof. The chipmaker has become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI). Its high-powered chips are in heavy demand to power those AI's computationally intensive systems, and they have become crucial for many companies. The downside for investors may be that the stock has already generated such impressive returns that it may be too late to benefit much from the growth.\n\nThe stock is up more than 220% over the past year and the company's market cap now tops $2 trillion. Some investors now wonder if they would be better off waiting for a dip in Nvidia's stock price. Or should they add shares now anyway?\n\nThe bullish case for Nvidia\n\nAs expensive as Nvidia's stock is, the sheer potential in AI suggests investors should remain bullish on it as an investment. The technology is still in its early stages, and companies are just beginning to develop AI models. According to a recent forecast from Gartner, the global market for AI chips will soar to $119.4 billion by 2027, which is more than double what it was worth in 2023.\n\nNvidia, being a dominant player in the industry and a provider of AI chips, stands to benefit from this growth. In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended Jan. 28, revenue grew by 126% to just under $61 billion, and net income was nearly half of that at around $30 billion.\n\nAs demand for AI chips grows, it's easy to see a path for Nvidia's earnings to continue growing, making its current valuation less problematic for long-term buy-and-hold investors.\n\nThe bearish case for Nvidia\n\nThe biggest concern with these AI developments is that reality won't align with the hype. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that when it comes to what AI can do, \"people are begging to be disappointed and they will be.\" While it can enhance productivity, the technology's potential, at least in the near term, may have been oversold.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, investors in many companies are paying for those sky-high expectations. Nvidia's valuation may look relatively reasonable when you look at its price/earnings-to-growth ratio, which is around 1.2, but that still implies a high level of earnings growth over the next five years. If those assumptions prove to be too optimistic, then that could make the AI stock vulnerable to a sell-off.\n\nPlus, there's always the risk of a recession. While there's talk of a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy, if it performs worse than expected, companies could scale back on their AI-related investments and spending, especially if the gains they are seeing from it aren't immediate or impactful enough.\n\nShould you invest in Nvidia's stock?\n\nNvidia is a leading AI company and it could be a great way to invest in tech. But investors should consider its valuation, and what assumptions they're relying on when they look at its price tag. If you're bullish on AI and believe it will be a game changer for industries and companies around the world, then it's certainly not too late to invest in Nvidia given its dominant presence in the space and the growth opportunities ahead.\n\nTrying to time the market, however, and waiting for a dip in Nvidia's stock may not be ideal because odds are it's not going to come down significantly unless there's a broader market sell-off related to the economy, which would mean its growth prospects have taken a big hit, in which case the entire investing thesis in the stock may change as well. So as long as you're bullish on AI, Nvidia can still be a good buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Fund managers monitor these portfolios, making adjustments to mirror benchmarks and potentially generating higher returns for shareholders.\n\nETFs have expense ratios that reduce your total returns, but most top ETFs keep these ratios low. You may end up with an ETF below 0.20%, but some funds have expense ratios closer to 1%.\n\nReviewing an ETF’s holdings and past performance can offer clues about how it may perform in the future. These are some of the top ETFs to buy in April, which can serve as good starting points for your research.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (VUG) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery.

This one sector makes up more than half of the fund’s total assets. Consumer Discretionary makes up 20% of the fund’s total portfolio, which doesn’t leave much room for other sectors.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven fill this fund’s list of Top 10 holdings.

The fund’s top 10 holdings are also filled with Magnificent Seven stocks. The stock is up by 39% over the past year and has rallied by 141% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund has generated 320% more returns than the S&P 500 since its 1999 launch. This stretch includes the dotcom bubble when QQQ lost more than 80% of its value from peak to trough. The fund has recovered marvelously since then.\n\nQQQ has a generous 0.20% expense ratio and has options available for people who want to use covered calls to increase their income. In addition to the Magnificent Seven, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) also made the fund’s list of top 10 holdings. Tech makes up more than half of the fund’s total assets.\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis fund has a higher expense ratio but has also delivered better returns. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) exposes investors to the semiconductor industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are its top three holdings. These stocks make up over 23% of the fund’s total assets.\n\nSOXX has a 0.35% expense ratio, which isn’t bad for an ETF up 55% over the past year. The stock has gained an even more impressive 243% over the past five years. The fund also has an annualized return of 24.47% over the past 10 years.\n\nThe stock’s performance has been solid, but it’s semiconductors or bust. Given recent shifts in the industry, it’s also artificial intelligence or bust. The ETF has many profitable companies that have opportunities to raise revenue and profit margins.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued AI Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has taken the stock market to unprecedented highs in the past year. Moreover, in butting heads over AI stocks, Wall Street is concerned that the sector’s sky-high valuations signal a potential bubble. Hence, in this scenario, it’d be tough to wrap your head around the notion of ‘the most undervalued AI stocks to buy in April.’\n\nFurthermore, Big Tech’s surge has essentially created a rising tide lifts all boats scenario, elevating prices of other AI stocks in its wake. Hence, with the AI field becoming more expensive and crowded, finding undervalued picks in the niche is challenging. Nevertheless, there are a few AI stocks with potential that investors haven’t caught on to yet. Here are three that should pique your interest.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a Robotics Process Automation (RPA) specialist, a field that leverages software robots and AI to handle routine tasks. RPA itself is burgeoning, but adding AI takes things to a whole new level. The synergy between the two technologies leads to greater efficiencies, opening up new areas for innovation. Thus, it transforms how businesses operate and scales their potential for robust returns in the tech sphere.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has made incredible progress in developing its recurring revenue base in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter (Q4), its annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached a whopping $1.46 billion, a 22% bump year over year (YOY). $86 million in net new ARR was added during Q4, a testament to the platform’s enduring demand and the efficiency of its subscription-based strategy. Additionally, the 70% jump in cloud ARR points to the rapid expansion of cloud-based automation solutions.\n\nConsequently, Tipranks’ analysts assign a healthy 22% upside in PATH stock from current prices.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the top AI penny stocks, specializing in developing AI-voice-powered products and services. It has attracted an impressive clientele quickly and is posting solid top-line growth numbers. Moreover, its customer base spans hospitals to data centers while making recent inroads into automotive for long-term growth. Some of its clients include Mercedes Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGAF), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).\n\nSOUN stock has built an impressive head of steam of late, gaining over 200% in the past six months alone. Many of these gains can be linked to a recent filing showing Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) sizeable business investment. It owns more than 1.7 million shares in Soundhound, and it’s easy to see why the AI juggernaut feels SoundHound is on the right track.\n\nBeamr Imaging (BMR) Render Video Encoder time HD. BMR stock\n\nSource: Andre_Carvalho / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeamr Imaging (NASDAQ:BMR) provides an AI-powered solution that significantly enhances the quality and efficiency of digital imagery. It leverages the power of AI to optimize high-resolution content for smooth distribution, streaming, and storage across different platforms. BMR stock has been ticking in the green, with year-to-date (YTD) gains at an eye-popping 345%.\n\nA long journey is ahead for the company as it looks to rise in the hotly competitive AI niche. Its collaboration with Nvidia, though, could be a major catalyst for the firm. The partnership aims to address the sluggish progress in upgrading video libraries for AI and streaming through AV1 encoding. The transition to AV1 offers superior compression while reducing bandwidth without impacting video quality. Leveraging NVIDIA’s NVENC, the solution looks to automate conversions to AV1, ensuring seamless, cost-effective transitions with virtually zero quality loss.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Oracle’s ORCL shares have been riding on an expanding partner base and a strong portfolio. Shares of ORCL have returned 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 12.2%.\r\n\r\nThe expanding partner base that includes companies like Microsoft MSFT and NVIDIA NVDA is helping ORCL shape its growth trajectory. It is evident from recent acquisitions of prominent clients, such as the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, ONO Pharmaceutical and Nokia.\r\n\r\nAn expanding clientele is expected to significantly contribute to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's top-line growth in the forthcoming quarters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 4% to 6%. Total revenues, excluding Cerner, are expected to increase in the range of 6-8%. The total cloud revenues, excluding Cerner, are anticipated to grow in the 22-24% band.\r\n\r\nOracle has collaborated with Microsoft to meet the increasing demand for its Database@Azure across the globe. The collaboration aims to expand ORCL’s Database@Azure to five additional regions, bringing the total planned multi-cloud availability footprint to 15 regions worldwide. Customers can now place orders for the Database@Azure in the Microsoft Azure Germany West Central region in Frankfurt, marking the service's European debut.\r\n\r\nTo cater to the growing customer demand, the service will soon be available in several new cloud regions, including Australia East, Brazil South, Canada Central, France Central, Central India, Italy North, Japan East, Southeast Asia, Sweden Central, United Kingdom South, Central United States, South Central United States and United Arab Emirates North.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Oracle and NVIDIA have extended collaboration to provide sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to customers worldwide. The collaboration offers turnkey solutions to help customers meet data sovereignty requirements. By combining NVIDIA's full-stack AI platform with ORCL's Enterprise AI, which is deployable across various Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) environments, customers gain greater control over operations, location and security.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to incorporate NVDA’s Grace Blackwell computing platform across OCI Supercluster and OCI Compute, enhancing performance for AI models significantly. The NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip promises faster real-time large language model inference and lower total cost of ownership, revolutionizing AI training, data processing, and engineering design and simulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle Corporation Price and Consensus Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation Quote\n\nRising Adoption of Cloud Services to Fend Off Competition\n\nThe company’s partnerships are likely to aid customer growth, thereby driving cloud services and license revenues in 2024 despite facing stiff competition from industry giants like Salesforce and Amazon AMZN.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2024 cloud services and license revenues is pegged at $44.68 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.58 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.98%.\r\n\r\nSalesforce's Sales Cloud, renowned for its automation capabilities and tailored CRM solutions for government entities, and Microsoft's suite of cloud services for government agencies pose formidable competition.\r\n\r\nAMZN’s cloud arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), offers its cloud services to more than 7,500 government agencies. AWS recently made headlines with the launch of SOLAR MINI Small Language Model by the South Korean AI startup, Upstage, on its platform. This innovative model operates seamlessly in both Korean and English, offering functionalities like content comprehension, summarization and translation.\r\n\r\nOracle’s cloud services offering has opened up a new source of recurring revenues (subscriptions), which is expected to improve visibility amid competition. The company is expected to benefit from the ongoing in-premise to cloud transitions leveraging its new technological developments.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Thinking Small, Winning Big: 7 Small-Cap Stocks to Supercharge Your Portfolio",
        "content": "If you’re searching for the best small-cap stocks to buy right now, look no further. Small-cap stocks are set to continue their record run as indices like the S&P 600 begin building momentum in light of rate cutting expectations and an improved economic outlook. Since nearly all companies, even the largest, started as small-caps, the sector tends to outperform larger indices in the long term.\n\nWe’re in a particularly unique position, as a year’s worth of higher rates means the worst or least viable companies are on their way out or didn’t survive the financial realignment. Today’s small-cap stocks, therefore, tend to be the strongest of the bunch, with management adept at navigating monetary policy changes and rapidly shifting economic conditions. These seven small-cap stocks stand out as some of the best of the bunch and could prove a solid foundation for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: PubMatic Inc (PUBM) The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital advertising is quickly becoming a perennial sector that tends to retain strength even amid poor economic conditions. While consumer spending may dip and eat into sales growth, the best digital advertising companies successfully navigate shifting conditions to stay afloat, if not thrive. PubMatic Inc (NASDAQ:PUBM) is among just a handful of small-cap digital advertising and media stocks that are successfully adapting to changing preferences – and thriving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year, record revenue figures for the small-cap advertising company hit $267 million in sales. Staying true to its small-cap growth stock designation, the company is plunging excess earnings into a comprehensive growth strategy to build on that momentum. Plans include improved customer acquisition strategies, revenue stream expansion, and increased machine learning emphasis to “[build and scale] ROI and outcomes-based advertising solutions that rival the walled gardens,” with walled gardens being a term describing the largest and impenetrable advertising heavyweights with closed ecosystems like Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAligned much more closely with the “value” side of the value/growth continuum than PubMatic, Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is nevertheless a standout small-cap stock offering investors long-term upside potential alongside short-term stability. To the latter point, the company’s gained nearly 50% over the past year and currently offers a 3.06% forward dividend yield – not bad for a company with less than $1.5 billion in market capitalization!\n\nBut investors looking for small-cap value stocks to buy shouldn’t focus on dividends alone. Instead, look to Steelcase’s steady revenue and rapidly increasing net income, which hit $777 million and $30.8 million in the most recent quarterly report. To that end, the company’s fiscal year 2025 outlook is especially enticing as it capitalizes on a steadier economy and continued remote work trends. Management reported 10% higher sales in the first three weeks of the fiscal year alone and is targeting 1% – 5% revenue growth and EPS between 85 cents and $1.00. Steelcase reported a year’s end EPS of 68 cents, so the rosy executive outlook should be enough to spark interest in small-cap value investors.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor stocks surged over the past year, but mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). As semiconductor demand remains high, but the biggest names tilt toward massive overvaluation, investors will increasingly turn to small-cap semiconductor stocks to find the “next big thing.” Few small-cap semiconductor stocks are as robust as indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI). The company’s offerings focus primarily on automotive and self-driving car semiconductor applications, which are increasingly in demand as new car sales climb and drivers demand state-of-the-art luxuries like driver assistance and enjoyable infotainment displays.\n\nThe company’s 2023 revenue was record-setting, climbing more than 100% to hit $223.2 million. Likewise, the company’s profit margins are beyond reproach at 52.5% in 2023, more than 2.5% higher than the prior year. This margin expansion indicates that the company is not only navigating shifting economic conditions but also thriving as it finds ways to improve efficiencies and cut costs without sacrificing quality.\n\nChegg Inc (CHGG) a child takes notes while attending an online class. represents education stocks. edtech stocks\n\nSource: Travelerpix / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) is a small-cap tech stock capturing one of the AI-adjacent sectors I’m particularly bullish on: education and EdTech. This year saw increased scrutiny and even dismissal of legacy learning institutions, even the most elite, and I think artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging remote work and learning tech will be among the next massive social revolutions. Chegg is adapting AI to a range of learning applications, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant. The tool is built on the back of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and represents one of the few, if not only, broadly successful adaptations or applications of the tools within the EdTech sector.\n\nOf course, new and next-gen tools tend to be costly and unpredictable early in their lifecycle. To that end, Chegg shares dropped more than 30% since 2024 began, primarily on the heels of a less-than-desirable earnings report that included a more modest forecast than analysts expected. Still, Chegg’s management acknowledged the rough patch as part of its R&D into AI EdTech applications, telling investors that its development is “ongoing and iterative” but that R&D costs mean it’s also “too early to predict when we will return to revenue and margin growth.” Still, at its current price point and relatively low valuation, Chegg is a top small-cap stock to capitalize on EdTech’s AI-enabled future.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: H&R Block (HRB) a man in a suit pulling a large bag of money with a rope. hot small-cap stocks for January 2024\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHave you filed your taxes yet? If not, you may be one of many Americans scrambling over the next two weeks, setting H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) for another solid earnings season. One of the primary concerns about companies like H&R Block is the inherent cyclical nature of their business – tax time comes every April, so customers tend to flock to the platform in January but fall off by mid-spring. However, H&R Block’s recent initiatives to smooth its sales cycle are bearing fruit, as spin-off initiatives like its Spruce mobile banking platform set increasingly higher client acquisition and retention rates.\n\nH&R Block’s last financial filing attributed more than $26 million in quarterly revenue to the banking platform. At roughly one-fourth of tax prep sales, that’s still a solid stat – especially when considering $26 million represents customer deposits quadrupling. As rates stay steady or fall, H&R Block will be able to capitalize on increasing deposit rates more and ultimately see income from peripheral financial services surge.\n\nValley National Bancorp An image of a cellphone with a bank on top, surrounded by people and piles of money, a credit card and calculator. fintech stocks\n\nSource: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock\n\nI wrote about Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) last week, focusing on the company’s potential strength as a cannabis stock. However, there’s far more to this small-cap regional bank than its cannabis-centric initiatives. Trading at just 0.6x book value and 7.5x earnings, the small-cap financial stock is undervalued and, in many cases, under-appreciated. Valley’s strong balance sheet and relatively low debt load (a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56, compared to the industry’s 1.2 average) means that management is positioned to adapt to whatever economic conditions may come, as evidenced by its newest stock buyback plan and 5.71% trailing dividend yield.\n\nAnalysts broadly see Valley National as undervalued, with an average $9.50 price target that sits about 20% above today’s per-share pricing. Likewise, they’re increasingly bullish about the small-cap bank stock as 56% call the stock a “hold”, compared to 50% calling for investors to sell during the previous polling period.\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) a photo of someone typing on a laptop on a wooden table with computer-related images\n\nSource: My Life Graphic/Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has been on a wild ride thus far in 2024, surging to nearly $45 per share after a solid earnings report before falling back down to pre-earnings levels where it sits today (slightly above $25 per share). But much of that decline seems to be investors merely taking profit rather than a substantial statement about GigaCloud’s long-term potential. The company, whose closest analog is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trades at just 11x earnings. Those looking at the stock with skepticism considering Alibaba’s fall from grace should consider one major differentiator: GigaCloud services B2B markets and, more than just offering product sourcing, is an all-in-one vendor management platform to navigate cross-border payments and other tricky facets of global eCommerce that small businesses tend to struggle with.\n\nThe small-and-medium-sized business (SMB) market is largely unaddressed, and GigaCloud’s solutions include payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and even warehouse storage. This all-in-one package is a boon to SMBs struggling to compete with or work through larger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As time goes on and companies like Amazon increasingly squeeze SMBs through fee and fulfillment rate hikes, those going it alone will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Wall Street ended the first quarter on an impressive note after a solid 2023. All the major indexes hit fresh record highs, and the rally is expected to continue as the Federal Reserve has indicated at least three rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nThe Dow and the S&P 500 were the first to hit a record high. The Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up in the race but did so in February end. In the first quarter, the Nasdaq gained 9.1%.\n\nTech stocks were responsible for the broader market rally in 2023 and the momentum has continued into this year.\n\nThe tech rally is being fueled by the ongoing optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, spearheaded by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nAI holds immense potential and the world is yet to witness it, several experts believe. NVIDIA’s success over the past year has inspired several other tech companies, big and small, to shift focus to AI to ensure more business opportunities in the coming days.\n\nThe advancement of smart devices is greatly influencing this domain, as they necessitate computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nSuch operations demand high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and enhanced graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are fostering favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry to thrive.\n\nInterestingly, the Nasdaq rally comes despite inflation coming in hotter than expected in the first two months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 0.4% sequentially in February, higher than a rise of 0.3% in the prior month and the biggest increase since September 2023. Core PPI also rose 0.4% month over month in February.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve said last month that it still plans three rate cuts of 25 basis points each by the end of this year. Although the Fed didn’t give a timeline, market participants believe the first rate cut is likely to happen in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Logitech International LOGI and Microsoft Corporation MSFT, whichhave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "The 3 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The best cloud computing stocks may have taken a backseat to some of the higher-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, specifically those in the semiconductor scene. Still, many leading cloud players also stand to gain from continued interest and investment in AI-related things.\n\nFrom the massive public cloud players to some less obvious plays focusing heavily on their AI-focused data center capabilities, cloud computing plays are definitely still worth following. Further, the cloud may actually be a source of reasonable valuations as investors begin to insist on some of the AI-at-a-reasonable-price (a potential variant of GARP?) types of plays. As AI’s influence works its way into other tech sub-sectors, I think growth rates could be in a spot to surprise over the next year or two.\n\nLet’s look to the best cloud computing stocks for potential growth stocks that value-conscious investors may wish to focus on heading into April.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Amazon Web Services (AWS) gearing up for the next generation of AI, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands to be a cloud computing stock that you simply cannot ignore. Yes, it’s one of the more obvious public cloud players that will benefit from the AI boom. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean an investment in AMZN stock can’t do well over time, especially at today’s multiples, which I view as very reasonable.\n\nAs Amazon gets its hands on the latest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell line of AI chips, don’t expect momentum in the AWS business to grind to a halt anytime soon. As the economy heats up and enterprises crank up their AI-related spending, AWS will be ready to pick up where it left off before the last few years of mild macro headwinds.\n\nFarther out, the Amazon Bedrock platform, its foundation model Titan, and its own chips (Trainium and Inferium for training and inference purposes, respectively) could become bigger needle movers for AMZN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another cloud darling that stands to be a big winner in the AI revolution as it continues to advance Einstein for its CRM customers. However, the company isn’t just equipped to thrive in that corner of the enterprise.\n\nAs Salesforce embeds next-generation AI technologies into Slack, its workplace communication platform, the firm seems poised to become one of the most influential beneficiaries in the corner of enterprise AI.\n\nSlack AI can save many employees tons of time as various aspects of the workday become automated. From AI-generated thread summaries to the incorporation of AI-driven Slack apps, I think there’s no denying the power of Salesforce’s ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wild card, though, is CEO Marc Benioff’s focus on AI ethics and safety. In the AI age, such a focus is key to steering clear of potential regulatory roadblocks in the future as Salesforce’s innovations are built to play by the rules.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) stock has been subject to big analyst price targets and rating upgrades in recent weeks following its wonderful quarter. The company isn’t merely hopping on the AI bandwagon now that it’s moving; it’s been investing aggressively across many aspects of AI for quite some time now.\n\nFollowing the firm’s recent quarter, we’ll have to throw Oracle into the conversation when discussing AI-leveraging cloud kings. As AI flies into the cloud, look for the $345 billion giant to “floor it” as it hopes to close the gap with some of its even larger rivals in the enterprise AI scene.\n\nAt this pace, it may be a matter of time before Oracle breaks into a league alongside AWS. Of course, only time will tell. Regardless, I’d look for the Fusion Cloud applications suite to act as a potential needle-mover in future quarters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon and Salesforce.

        "title": "Top 5 Momentum Stocks for April After a Strong March",
        "content": "Wall Street ended a strong March, marking the fifth consecutive positive month for all three major stock indexes. Last month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were up 2.1%, 3.1% and 1.8%, respectively. In fact, the Dow posted its first five-month winning streak since May 2021.\n\nU.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after witnessing an astonishing 2023. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have advanced 5.1%, 10.8% and 11.4%, respectively.\n\nMomentum Likely to Continue\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. economy grew at a clip of 3.4% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the initial consensus estimate of 2%. The U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.9% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession.\n\nThe headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose 0.3% month over month in February and 2.5% annually. The January numbers were a rise of 0.4% month over month and 2.5% year over year.\n\nThe core PCE price index (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.3% month over month and 2.8% annually in February, while the respective January numbers were 0.5% and 2.9%. Notably, the core PCE price index is the Fed’s most favored inflation gauge. The annual increase of the core PCE inflation rate in February 2024 was the lowest since February 2021.\n\nPersonal consumption expenditure increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and 0.2% increase in January. Personal income rose 0.3% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and 1% increase in January. Personal savings rate dropped to 3.6% in February from upwardly revised 4.1% in January.\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows a 61% probability of the first cut of the existing Fed funds rate in the June FOMC meeting. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in momentum stocks. We have narrowed our search to five large-cap stocks that have strong momentum for April. These companies have strong potential for 2024 too.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A or B.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. PGR continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 61.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nUiPath Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nCarlisle Companies Inc. CSL is set to gain from its focus on delivering innovative new products, driven by increased investment in research and development.

Strong demand for reroofing products bodes well for the CCM segment.\n\nSolid repair and remodel demand across the building envelope in commercial and residential markets augurs well for the CWT segment. Synergies from several buyouts bolster CSL’s growth. Contribution from CSL Operating System and price realization are supporting its margins. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging.\n\nCarlisle Companies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5% and 11%, respectively, for the next year (ending December 2025).

        "title": "When You Look Back in 5 Years, You'll Wish You'd Bought This Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began as an online bookseller when it was founded in 1994. E-commerce remains the company's largest source of revenue, but it has also expanded into other areas of the technology sector, including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI could be one of the greatest financial opportunities in history, and Amazon is tackling it from multiple angles. The company just made the final payment of its agreed $4 billion investment into leading AI start-up Anthropic, a deal that will accelerate Amazon's progress on both the hardware and software sides.\n\nAmazon is one of six companies valued at $1 trillion or more, and all of its peers have a presence in AI. However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch. Here's why investors might regret not buying it when they look back on this moment in five years.\n\nAmazon is cementing itself as a leader in artificial intelligence\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services platform in the world. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI.\n\nThe hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads.\n\nHowever, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.\n\nBut some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nReady-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Amazon-Anthropic deal will accelerate progress on all fronts\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.\n\nAnthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code.\n\nAnthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider.\n\nMicrosoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race.\n\nAmazon is the cheapest trillion-dollar stock by this metric\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).\n\nNevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2.\n\nAs the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google). NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation.\n\nHowever, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nTherefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential. As it grows to become a larger contributor to Amazon's overall revenue, it will make the entire organization more profitable. When investors look back on this moment in a handful of years, they might be glad they bought Amazon stock at its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, CME Group Inc. CME, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and BlackRock, Inc. BLK.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Crypto Stocks to Watch Ahead of Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nThe cryptocurrency market had a solid first quarter, following a rally in 2023 that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high. On Mar 14, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high of $73,750, with its market capitalization surpassing $1.44 trillion.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin declined below the $70,000 level before regaining some of the lost ground and traded at $70,657 on Mar 29. The drop in Bitcoin price raised concerns among some, but the decline is temporary as the cryptocurrency still has huge potential.\n\nThe recent decline, to a large extent, is due to profit booking and the slight uptick in inflation over the past two months. Even then, Bitcoin has gained more than 67% in the first quarter after jumping 157% in 2023.\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin rally can be attributed to the much-awaited cryptocurrency reformation event in early January when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe decision was intended to integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance to provide support to the sector in the long term.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin halving event is set to begin this month. The event entails the halving of mining rewards for new blocks, historically leading to increased scarcity of Bitcoin. As a result, miners face greater difficulty in generating a net increase in Bitcoins. Traditionally, Bitcoin's value tends to surge during these periods of tightened supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2(Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and was one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 19.5% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 3.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 60 days. CME presently has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 354.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 500% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 60 days. BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Eli Lilly and Company LLY, American Tower Corp. AMT and McKesson Corp. MCK.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, NVIDIA and Eli Lilly\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock down -11.9% in the year-to-date period compared to +11.4% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and the +10.1% gain for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nApple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+82.5% vs. +61.1%). The company’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nEli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+33.7% vs. +15.6%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.\r\n\r\nLilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.\r\n\r\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American Tower Corp. and McKesson Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCould Goldilocks Run in Q2 Be Even More Thrilling?\n\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\n\nSolid Fundamentals of the U.S. Economy\n\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\n\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.\n\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Saga to Continue in the Long Term\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\n\nStrong Expectations for Q1 2024 Earnings\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\n\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nFed’s Rate Cut Indications\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: NVIDIA (NVDA)",
        "content": "I last profiled NVIDIA (NVDA) for the Bull of the Day on February 28 after another big beat-and-raise quarter caught most investors and analysts off-guard and shares jumped from $675 to new highs above $800.\n\nThat article also has a video link where I go over an NVIDIA slide deck that should blow your mind.\r\n\r\nI've been telling investors since that they won't see $700 again. And that prophecy became further solidified after the semiannual GPU Tech Conference (GTC) the week of March 18.\r\n\r\nGTC 2024: March 18th Will Be Remembered For Years\r\n\r\nJust as I tell investors to check in with the NVIDIA Newsroom every couple of weeks to see the latest in innovations on the accelerated computing/AI frontier, so too being aware of GTC events is critical.\r\n\r\nBecause there is always a flurry of new technologies and partnerships unveiled, to say nothing of the most recent scientific R&D that Jensen highlights as accomplished using their hardware and software stacks.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, GTC 2024 kicked off with these observations from Jensen & Co...\r\n\r\nGenerative AI promises to revolutionize every industry it touches — all that’s been needed is the technology to meet the challenge.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang on 3/18 introduced that technology — the company’s new Blackwell computing platform — as he outlined the major advances that increased computing power can deliver for everything from software to services, robotics to medical technology and more.\r\n\r\n“Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point — general purpose computing has run out of steam,” Huang told more than 11,000 GTC attendees gathered in-person — and many tens of thousands more online — for his keynote address at Silicon Valley’s cavernous SAP Center arena.\r\n\r\n“We need another way of doing computing — so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing, so that we can continue to consume more and more computing while being sustainable. Accelerated computing is a dramatic speedup over general-purpose computing, in every single industry.”\r\n\r\nIntroducing the Blackwell Superchip\r\n\r\nLess than a year after NVIDIA unveiled the DGX GH200 supercomputer pod, at GTC they rolled out the DGX GB200 SuperPOD. I previewed the coming mystery \"superchip\" -- that was expected to be much faster and more energy efficient -- in my February profile.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, “GH” is for Grace Hopper. Jensen likes to find unsung heroes of computing and science to name his products after and this was a salute to Grace Brewster Hopper, an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming.\r\n\r\nSo who is Blackwell? David Blackwell was an American statistician and mathematician who made significant contributions to game theory and information theory. He was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, the first African American full professor (with tenure) at the University of California, Berkeley, and the seventh African American to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you put the Admiral of COBOL together with the Bayesian stats genius? According to Jensen, you get a platform to “power a new era of computing.”\r\n\r\nTo scale up Blackwell, NVIDIA built a new chip called NVLink Switch. Each can connect four NVLink interconnects at 1.8 terabytes per second and eliminate traffic by doing in-network reduction.\r\n\r\nSo the GB200 NVL72 is a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system for the most compute-intensive workloads. It combines 36 Grace Blackwell Superchips, which include 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVLink.\r\n\r\nThe Blackwell platform will enable organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nConvergent Technologies = Exponential Acceleration\r\n\r\nThe Blackwell GPU architecture features six transformative technologies for accelerated computing, which will help unlock breakthroughs in data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design, quantum computing and generative AI — all emerging industry opportunities for NVIDIA.\r\n\r\n“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing, with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,” said Huang. \"Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell is the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.”\r\n\r\nAnd who is lined up to buy these systems? Only the who’s who of big tech: Amazon Web Services, Dell Technologies, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI. You can read their view of this breakthrough in one of the March 18 press releases.\r\n\r\nEstimates Still Levitating\r\n\r\nIn my February report, I noted that sales estimates would continue to rise in March as analysts re-worked their models and caught up to the real, but still hard-to-believe, demand for solutions from the King of AI.\r\n\r\nNext year's topline has moved from $117 billion to $125 billion, with the high estimate at $142B. I expect the consensus for next year to soon be $150B.\r\n\r\nAnd with gross margins above 75%, NVIDIA continues to release the profit flow. This year's EPS consensus has risen over 20% in the past two months to $23.84, representing 84% growth. Next year is projected to top EPS of $27.\r\n\r\nLimits to AI Growth and Impacts?\r\n\r\nHow long can it go on for? And what about the massive energy costs, both financial and environmental, of all these datacenters running at insane speeds and temperatures.\r\n\r\nTake it from Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, who forecasts a 1000x improvement in GPU performance per watt over the next 15 years. JD Ross, cofounder of Opendoor and now working on energy projects, wrote this last week on Twitter @justindross...\r\n\r\n\"Coupled with major algorithmic improvements we're quickly seeing every week, it isn't crazy to expect 100,000 to 1,000,000x increase in AI performance per dollar in the next decade and a half.\"\r\n\r\nJensen always told us that GPU-driven massively parallel architectures had reinvented Moore's Law and were going to give exponential life to computing that solves big problems in science, industry, and society. He kept his promise.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.\n\nBy the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock may be in a bubble\n\nOver the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nNvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.\n\nNvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.\n\nThe chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.\n\nHere are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.\n\n1. Alphabet: $1.88 trillion current market cap (Class A shares, GOOGL)\n\nThe first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nThe reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.\n\n2. Amazon: $1.87 trillion current market cap\n\nLike Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nHowever, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: $1.24 trillion current market cap\n\nEven though social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.\n\nMeta's \"secret sauce\" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.\n\nThe other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match. BRK.A Chart\n\n4. Berkshire Hathaway: $908 billion current market cap (Class A shares, BRK.A)\n\nA fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!\n\nOne of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the \"Oracle of Omaha's\" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.\n\nWarren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.\n\n5. Visa: $573 billion current market cap\n\nThe fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa(NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.\n\nWhat makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nVisa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Finally Revealed How It's Working With SoundHound AI. Here's What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "Euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling the capital markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are hovering near record levels as megacap tech companies continue to benefit from AI tailwinds.\n\nAt the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data-center services is off the charts. As a result, Nvidia's revenue and profits are accelerating at unprecedented levels.\n\nThe company is investing in several different areas of AI, and one in particular is garnering a lot of attention. Nvidia is an investor in speech-recognition platform SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN).\n\nLet's dig into this partnership and learn why voice-recognition software is on Nvidia's radar. More importantly, let's assess the opportunities to invest in this budding area of the AI realm.\n\nVoice-recognition is a huge market\n\nYou may not realize it, but there's a pretty good chance that you interact with voice-recognition software on a daily basis. Apple has integrated the technology across its hardware devices through Siri. Moreover, both Amazon and Alphabet leverage speech AI applications across their respective lines of smart home appliances.\n\nMarket research suggests that by next decade the market size for voice-recognition technology could reach $50 billion. Given its big-tech peers already have an established presence in the AI-powered voice market, coupled with the technology's growth potential, it's not surprising to see Nvidia enter the scene. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's investment spurred a lot of interest\n\nInvestors learned that Nvidia is an investor in SoundHound AI earlier this year, following a 13F filing by the chipmaker. This caused SoundHound AI stock to surge -- with shares rising from penny-stock levels to as high as $8.91 per share.\n\nWhile this was fun to witness, details surrounding Nvidia's relationship with SoundHound AI were sparse. But following Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in late March, investors finally learned a bit more about the partnership.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's Drive infrastructure helps car manufacturers collect data loads that are needed to refine autonomous-driving technology. Given SoundHound AI's existing portfolio of work with Stellantis, Hyundai, Kia, and Honda, there is some obvious overlap between the company and Nvidia's technology.\n\nSoundHound AI will be offering a voice assistant that runs on Nvidia's Drive for its automobile customers. This is a unique generative AI feature that provides drivers the ability to ask questions related to maintenance, safety, car settings, among other things.\n\nInvestors should assess different opportunities\n\nSoundHound AI's partnership with Nvidia is exciting. But the company needs to prove that the relationship with Nvidia can be translated into tangible growth. Given the abnormal surge in the stock, I'd caution investors from buying SoundHound AI stock at its current valuation.\n\nMoreover, SoundHound AI is far from the only company leveraging Nvidia Drive. During GTC, investors learned that Li Auto, Nio, Lenovo, and others are implementing Drive and other sibling AI services developed by Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia is best known for its chip business, the company is proving that it can disrupt areas beyond AI-powered hardware. I see the investment in SoundHound AI as one of many opportunities Nvidia is exploring to generate growth in its under-the-radar software business, all while playing an integral role in autonomous driving, which very well may be the next frontier of the automobile industry.\n\nWhile SoundHound AI may appear as a lucrative opportunity, the company still has a lot to prove. By contrast, I think Nvidia is the engine powering myriad applications in the AI realm right now. For this reason, I see the stock as a compelling choice for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

As a result, the company's stock is up 242% since last March, almost entirely based on excitement over its AI prospects.\n\nWith the industry projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030, it's no wonder investors have flocked to the market. However, plenty of companies are moving into AI and could have more room to run than Nvidia or might be trading at a better value than the chipmaker.\n\nConsequently, it's a good idea to look for alternative ways to invest in the budding sector. Other companies in the Magnificent Seven are an excellent place to start, with many known for their reliability over the long term and heavy investment in AI.\n\nSo forget Nvidia. You'll regret not buying these Magnificent Seven stocks instead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai describes the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" This year, a poor debut for its new large language model Gemini created doubt over its potential in the industry. However, the company remains a behemoth in tech, with significant cash reserves that will likely see the company retain its dominance and eventually catch up to its AI rivals.\n\nIn-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and Google have granted Alphabet a powerful position in tech. These brands attract billions of users and have helped the company's annual revenue rise 90% in the last five years, with operating income up 135%. Meanwhile, Alphabet's many products create almost endless opportunities to boost its business with AI.\n\nImproving Gemini could see Alphabet offer more effective advertising, develop a search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, better analyze viewing trends on YouTube, and expand its AI cloud services on Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe chart above shows Alphabet's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. These are helpful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health, and the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's free cash flow of nearly $70 billion, compared to Nvidia's $27 billion, suggests it's potentially better equipped to keep investing in its business and overcome current headwinds.\n\nThe Google company may have hit a few roadblocks this year, but that's precisely why now is the perfect time to make long-term investments in its stock. The Magnificent Seven company has an exciting outlook for the coming years and trades at a bargain, compared to Nvidia.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) delivered impressive growth in 2023 after facing declines from an economic downturn in 2022. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion.\n\nA solid recovery in its e-commerce earnings over the last year has seen the company's free cash flow soar 904% to surpass $32 billion. This indicates it has the financial resources to continue expanding and manage possible hurdles.\n\nAmazon has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out of Seattle almost 30 years ago. The tech giant has expanded into multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nAmazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, the table above indicates Nvidia's earnings could reach $36 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Amazon's may achieve $7 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios (Nvidia's 36 and Amazon's 43) yields stock prices of $1,309 for Nvidia and $301 for Amazon.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 45% by fiscal 2026 and Amazon's increase by 67%. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and expanding position in AI, Amazon is a Magnificent Seven stock worth considering over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Monday, April 1, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock down -11.9% in the year-to-date period compared to +11.4% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and the +10.1% gain for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nApple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+82.5% vs. +61.1%). The company’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nEli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+33.7% vs. +15.6%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.\r\n\r\nLilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers.  Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca.  These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.\r\n\r\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), American Tower Corporation (AMT) and McKesson Corporation (MCK).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, below-par volumes due to the weak freight demand scenario remain a concern.\n\nInvestments to Benefit Entergy (ETR), Poor Financials Woe\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Entergy's solid investments are expected to boost its grid upgrades and customer reliability. Yet its deteriorating financial ratios implies its poor financial position.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) Benefits From Solid Product Portfolio\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Onto Innovation's performance benefits from increasing demand for the Dragonfly inspection system. However, stiff competition is a major headwind.\n\nSolid Revenue Growth & Buyouts Aid Encompass Health (EHC)\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, Encompass Health's top line has been fueled by growing patient volumes.

        "content": "When it comes to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta(NASDAQ: META), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.\n\nApple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year. AAPL data by YCharts.\n\nApple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.\n\nWhy is Apple stock down?\n\nApple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.\n\nChina accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.\n\nNow that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.\n\nIs Apple stock a buy now?\n\nHere are three reasons for optimism:\n\nConsumer strength Services Return of capital.\n\nWhile iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below. Source: Statista.\n\nServices include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.\n\nApple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.\n\nApple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.\n\nLastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by \"bridging the physical and digital space.\" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.\n\nApple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -1.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Nvidia (NVDA) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $23.84.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.

        "title": "Goldilocks' Golden Run to be More Thrilling in Q2: 5 Picks",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe, that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\n\nSolid Fundamentals of the U.S. Economy\n\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\n\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.\n\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\n\nAI Saga to Continue in the Long Term\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\n\nStrong Expectations for Q1 2024 Earnings\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\n\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nFed’s Rate Cut Indications\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AMZN has surged 18.8% year to date.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Snub VIX's Climb, Focus on S&amp;P 500's Striking Rise: 4 Picks",
        "content": "An out-of-the-ordinary thing happened in the stock market in the first quarter. Wall Street’s fear gauge, better known as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), and the broader S&P 500 climbed northward in the period.\n\nNow, VIX is always associated with distress among investors, and the stock market may be bracing for a selloff. However, the S&P 500 hasn’t witnessed a pullback of more than 2% in quite some time and has instead registered its strongest first-quarter gains since 2019.\n\nThe VIX has jumped 4.5% since the beginning of the quarter to around 13, which is way below its long-term average of 20. On the other hand, the S&P 500 surged 10.2% during the first three-month period of this year and notched its 22nd record closing high of the year. The index achieved its first 17 record-high close in the first 50 trading sessions of this year, per Bespoke Investment Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 also outpaced other major bourses like the Dow and the Nasdaq, which gained 5.6% and 9.1%, respectively. Thus, it can be safely assumed that investors aren’t nervous this time around. Moreover, the VIX gained traction after hitting a closing low in December due to the mean reversion nature of implied volatility.\n\nNonetheless, the S&P 500’s marvelous rise was driven by AI optimism and expectations that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates later this year. Tech stocks particularly advanced by leaps and bounds as AI contributed toward countless technological developments. Meanwhile, the Fed assured three interest rate cuts in the second half of 2024, and Chair Jerome Powell was not taken aback by the recent uptick in inflation. The Fed disregarded the jump in February’s PCE index.\n\nConsumer outlays, by the way, picked up last month after a lull at the commencement of the year.  In that way, household spending boosted economic growth and helped the stock market scale upward as well. Consumer spending in the United States increased by 0.8% in February, its biggest gain since January 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, with recession worries on the ebb and the S&P 500 moving up, it’s prudent for astute investors to place their bets on solid stocks listed on the index that have not only gained in the first quarter but also are positioned to advance in the near future.\n\nThese stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK, W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11.2% over the past 60 days. AMZN’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 40.7%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is a leading producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear. Deckers Outdoor currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.4% over the past 60 days. DECK’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 38.7%.\n\nW.W. Grainger is a business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating products and services. W.W. Grainger currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GWW’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.1%.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 19.5% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84%.\n\nShares of Amazon, Deckers Outdoor, W.W.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NVDA) Up 82.5% in Q1: Can It Sustain the Momentum?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 82.5% surge in its stock price in the first quarter of 2024, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in March 2024 by joining the exclusive club of companies with more than $2 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\n\nHowever, the looming question remains — Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum in the quarters ahead?\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nGenAi Investments to Aid NVDA’s Surge\n\nNVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI’s inherited opportunities and the company’s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024.\n\nNVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\n\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nThe generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $24 billion from $7.19 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nOther Stocks Worth Considering\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Meta Platforms META, Zscaler ZS and Twilio TWLO.\n\nMeta Platforms currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2024 earnings has been revised 13% upward to $19.94 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 91.6%. The long-term estimated earnings growth rate for the stock stands at 19.5%.\n\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 26 cents to $4.03 per share in the past 30 days, which calls for an increase of 52.5% on a year-over-year basis. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for the stock is pegged at 28.1%.\n\nTwilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for Twilio’s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 6 cents to $2.70 per share over the past seven days, which indicates a 10.2% increase from 2023. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 19.6%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Next Big Move",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a definite mover and shaker in recent years. The company has become the world's No. 1 artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer, holding 80% of the market. And this has translated into skyrocketing earnings, with revenue and net income soaring in the triple digits last year. And Nvidia continues to innovate, recently announcing the upcoming launch of a new chip architecture -- the Blackwell platform -- and its most powerful chips ever.\n\nThis tech company isn't one to sit still, so it's natural that investors love to try predicting its next big move. And right now, I'm going to jump in and share my prediction of what we might expect next from Nvidia. I'll give you a clue: The company's stock has soared past a level that, in the past, coincided with a key decision. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's record share price\n\nNvidia shares have climbed more than 240% over the past year, bringing the company's market value to $2.2 trillion, and today trade at the record level of more than $900. Back in May of 2021, when its stock was trading for about $700, Nvidia announced a 4-for-1 stock split and aimed to win approval during its June annual meeting.\n\nI predict this scenario could happen again this spring -- with an announcement potentially during the company's next earnings report in May -- as Nvidia prepares for its next shareholder meeting. That's likely to take place in June if we consider calendars from previous years.\n\nWhy do I think Nvidia will make the move soon? For a few reasons. First, as mentioned, Nvidia's last stock split happened when the company's stock price reached similar levels. So, the company has been known to announce such an operation after significant gains and as the stock approached $1,000.\n\nSecond, a stock price near $1,000 or beyond makes it difficult for some investors to get in on the investment opportunity. Sure, fractional shares exist, but some brokerages don't offer them, and in certain cases, investors prefer buying full shares. Also, other investors may worry that even if valuation looks good, a stock still will struggle to advance significantly once it reaches into the thousands of dollars -- and that could make them hesitate before buying a $900 stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy splitting its stock, a company erases all of those problems, opening the door to a broader range of investors.\n\nNext, it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia has completed five stock splits in the past, meaning the company is amenable to this kind of action. The earlier splits happened between 2000 and 2007.\n\nHow a stock split would affect Nvidia\n\nNow, let's consider how a potential split would work and the impact it may have on Nvidia's share performance. During a split, a company offers additional shares to current shareholders to bring down the price of each individual share, while keeping the market value as is. The resulting stock price is determined by the ratio of the split, whether it's 4-for-1 like Nvidia's most recent operation or a different proportion.\n\nIf you're a current shareholder, the value of your investment will remain the same, but you'll find yourself with additional shares.\n\nStock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share price performance, so I wouldn't count on a potential Nvidia stock split to push the stock higher. To use the past as an example, Nvidia stock didn't immediately rise after the 2021 stock split. The shares did advance later that year, though, but that was thanks to fundamentals, such as gains in revenue. NVDA Chart\n\nThat said, a stock split, by making the shares more accessible to a wide range of investors, may prompt more and more of them to consider the stock rather than to opt for lower-priced players. This is positive over the long term, but doesn't result in sudden share price gains.\n\nSo, my prediction is the moment is right for Nvidia to split its stock, and it may be the company's next big move. But it doesn't matter whether you buy the stock today or after a potential split -- in both cases, you could win by getting in on this great long-term AI story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "3 Super Semiconductor Stocks (Including Nvidia) to Buy Hand Over Fist for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution",
        "content": "ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are just a few of the powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot applications available today. They can interpret and generate text, images, videos, and computer code, which could drive a productivity boom across the global economy.\n\nBut those AI applications wouldn't be possible without data centers filled with advanced semiconductors, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their models. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang estimates the current $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure around the world will double over the next five years because of AI.\n\nThat creates a substantial opportunity for leading chip companies Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU). Here's why investors might want to own a stake in each of them to ride the AI boom.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe gaming industry used to be Nvidia's largest source of revenue, but its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center are now driving its business forward. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU sent the company's data center revenue surging 217% to $47.5 billion, and the current fiscal 2025 year is expected to bring more growth.\n\nNvidia's H100 is the most sought-after data center chip for AI workloads. Many tech giants are lining up to buy it in large volumes, from Amazon to Oracle to Meta Platforms. But Nvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which could fuel the company's next wave of growth.\n\nThe H200 can inference -- which means to feed live data to an AI model so it can make predictions -- at twice the speed of its predecessor, and it also consumes 50% less energy, so it's a big cost saver for data center operators.\n\nLonger term, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will power its next-generation chips. The company is expected to ship its Blackwell B200 GPUs next year, which will deliver 15 times the inferencing speed of the H100.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's total revenue to soar 81% to a record $110 billion in the current fiscal year. Despite the 240% gain in its stock over the last 12 months, there is still plenty of room for upside.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAMD makes some of the world's most popular chips for consumer electronics. They can be found in the Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Sony PlayStation 5, not to mention a long list of personal computers. But AMD recently launched its MI300 series of data center chips in a quest to chase down Nvidia.\n\nThe MI300 is available as a standard GPU called the MI300X, but it's also available in a combined GPU and CPU configuration called the MI300A. AMD is already shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its El Capitan supercomputer, which will be one of the most powerful in the world when it comes online this year. But a number of leading data center operators, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, are also lining up to buy the MI300 series.\n\nWhile AMD is chasing Nvidia in the data center, the company has a dominant market share of 90% in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing industry. Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center.\n\nIn the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year. Combined with the growing shipments of the MI300 chips -- which could generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024 -- this could be AMD's biggest year.\n\n3. Micron\n\nMicron doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia and AMD because it produces memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as GPUs. However, every GPU requires memory, and it's critical to extracting its maximum performance.\n\nMicron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) data center solution was selected by Nvidia to power its new H200. It's an obvious choice because it consumes 30% less power than competing HBM hardware, making it far more cost efficient. Micron is currently sampling a new HBM3E product, which packs 50% more memory into each GPU, allowing Nvidia's customers to bring their AI models to market far more quickly.\n\nMicron's entire 2024 HBM inventory is already sold out, and much of its 2025 stock is already spoken for, too.\n\nLike AMD, Micron's AI opportunity is expanding beyond the data center. The AI-enabled chipsets inside new personal computers can require 80% more DRAM content than traditional models, which is great for Micron's business. Many modern smartphones are also fitted with AI chips, which need twice as much DRAM as traditional devices. Samsung's new Galaxy S24 comes with a slew of AI features, and it runs on Micron's hardware.\n\nMicron's revenue jumped 57% year over year during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). The company also delivered net income of $793 million, marking a welcome return to profitability after more than a year grappling with falling prices due to an oversupply of chips.\n\nMicron's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1) points to accelerated revenue growth of 76%. Micron stock is trading at an all-time high, but it's still cheaper than both Nvidia and AMD, so this could be a great buying opportunity for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "\"April showers bring May flowers.\" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.\n\nYou might not think the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.\n\nCrossing names off the list\n\nWe can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.\n\nIt's a similar story for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.\n\nWall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.\n\nThe \"A team\"\n\nThat leaves the \"A team\" as the top contenders: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.\n\nApple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Apple?\n\nI'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.\n\nBut Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI because of its \"incredible breakthrough potential.\" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.\n\nIt's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the \"wow\" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

It has also been one of the hottest stocks in 2024, gaining 91% during that time.\n\nWith NVIDIA trading at new all-time highs, why jump in now?\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 38.8. While that is not in the traditional value stock range, which is normally under 15, that is cheap for NVIDIA, which has often traded above 40x over the last 5 years.\n\nNVIDIA’s trajectory changed a year ago, as the demand for AI surged. It has beat, and raised, its earnings guidance each of the last four quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, NVIDIA saw record quarterly revenue up 265% year-over-year, to $22.1 billion.\n\nEarnings growth is equally as impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump another 84% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA’s Partners Also Expected to See Strong Growth\n\nSkeptical about NVIDIA’s rapid growth? Tracey takes a look at two of its data center partners to see what their sales and earnings trajectory looks like.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also in the AI trade. It’s hard to believe, but the stock has been even hotter than NVIDIA’s.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer are up 259% year-to-date and 823% over the last year.\n\nBut its sales and earnings consensus estimates are also tracking NVIDIA’s. Super Micro Computer’s sales in fiscal 2024 are expected to jump 103.5% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. The earnings are expected to rise 83.8%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\n2. Vertiv Holding Co. VRT\n\nVertiv is another partner company with NVIDIA on the data center side of the AI trade. Shares have jumped 69% year-to-date and over the last year are up 531%.\n\nVertiv is also seeing big growth from AI. It has been beating, and raising earnings guidance, for the last several quarters. Vertiv’s earnings are now expected to jump 32.8% in 2024.\n\nSales are rising, but not as quickly asat NVIDIA or Super Micro Computer. The Zacks sales consensus is looking for growth of 11.2% this year.\n\nVertiv is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nIs NVIDIA Too Hot to Handle?\n\nIt’s difficult to buy a stock at, or near, a new all-time high. But NVIDIA’s shares have made new highs many times over the last 5 years, as shares have surged 2000%.\n\nFundamentals matter as much as the chart. And NVIDIA has strong fundamentals right now, including sales and earnings growth.\n\nShould NVIDIA be on Your Short List?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in her own personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Since the advent of the internet completely changed the course of business in the mid-1990s, there's nothing that's garnered as much buzz on Wall Street as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nWith AI and the incorporation of machine learning (ML), software and systems have the ability to learn over time and become more proficient at their tasks. The broad-reaching scope of AI in virtually every sector and industry is why the analysts at PwC believe it could add more than $15 trillion to global gross domestic product by the turn of the decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough dozens of stocks have benefited from the AI revolution, none have enjoyed a more direct boost to their sales and bottom line than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThis \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI revolution is on the chopping block by billionaires\n\nIn a little more than a year, Nvidia has become what I like to call the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have come to dominate high-compute data centers. Though estimates vary, Nvidia's ultra-fast GPUs might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nThis is a company that's also enjoying otherworldly pricing power on its GPUs. With demand overwhelming supply throughout 2023, cost of revenue moved only modestly higher while data center sales more than tripled. This is a pretty clear indication that pricing power is behind much of Nvidia's sales and profit spike.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that Nvidia is headed higher. During the December-ended quarter, eight prominent billionaire investors pared down their stakes in this top-performing megacap, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne of the primary reasons to be skeptical of Nvidia's phenomenal run-up is that it's been driven by GPU scarcity. With Nvidia set to meaningfully increase its output in the current calendar year, and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel rolling out advanced AI-GPUs of their own, it's only logical to expect its pricing power to decline.\n\nWhat's arguably even more concerning is that Nvidia's top four customers by revenue (40% of total sales) are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. This is either going to lessen their future reliance on Nvidia as their in-house data center chips complement what Nvidia produces, or they could phase Nvidia's infrastructure out altogether. Either way, it's a worrisome development for a richly valued stock.\n\nBut while billionaires were busy running for the exit from Nvidia, they weren't shy about pressing the buy button on two other hypergrowth AI stocks during the fourth quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first high-octane AI growth stock that appeared to whet the whistles of billionaire money managers during the December-ended quarter is cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). Four highly successful billionaires added to their funds' respective stakes in CrowdStrike, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (400,988 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (97,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (91,091 shares)\n\nOn a macro basis, the cybersecurity industry has the look of a surefire growth story through at least the remainder of the decade. As businesses continue shifting their data online and into the cloud, third-party providers are being relied on with frequency to protect this information from hackers.\n\nFurthermore, cybersecurity solutions can thrive in any economic climate. A bad day for Wall Street or a rough patch for the U.S. economy doesn't mean a thing to hackers and robots looking to steal sensitive information. Since CrowdStrike is a subscription-driven company that protects end users, it's well-positioned to generate predictable cash flow no matter what's happening with the economy or stock market.\n\nOn a more company-specific basis, CrowdStrike brings clearly identifiable competitive advantages to the table for its customers and investors. The company's Falcon security platform is driven by AI and ML. Falcon is overseeing trillions of events each week, which are making it smarter and more effective at recognizing and responding to potential threats.\n\nThere are a couple of key performance indicators that demonstrate just how much pull CrowdStrike has with businesses. Even though its platform isn't the cheapest, gross retention rate has been pegged right around 98% for multiple years. Additionally, the company's net retention rate hasn't fallen below 119% in more than five years. This means the company's existing clients are spending at least 19% more on a year-over-year basis.\n\nBut the key to CrowdStrike's success has been its ability to upsell existing customers. Whereas a single-digit percentage of its clients seven years ago had purchased four or more cloud module subscriptions, 64% of its customers now have five or more cloud module subscriptions. These add-on sales have lifted its adjusted subscription gross margin to an impressive 80%!\n\nSnowflake\n\nThe second hypergrowth artificial intelligence stock that billionaires were buying as they were sending Nvidia to the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Similar to CrowdStrike, four billionaire investors stepped up and added to their funds' stakes, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,985,426 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (1,204,387 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (888,047 shares)\n\nThere look to be two reasons why billionaire asset managers are choosing to load up on shares of Snowflake: opportunity and competitive edge.\n\nWith regard to the former, enterprise cloud spending, and AI solutions/applications within the cloud, are still in their early innings of expansion. Buying shares of Snowflake offers a way for investors to have exposure to the rapid growth in enterprise cloud and AI.\n\nThe other reason billionaires likely piled into Snowflake is because of its well-defined competitive advantages. For example, Snowflake's infrastructure is layered atop the leading cloud infrastructure service platforms. While sharing data can be challenging across competing cloud platforms, it's seamless for Snowflake's customers.\n\nLikewise, Snowflake doesn't rely on subscriptions. Rather, it charges customers based on the data they store and the Snowflake Compute Credits they use. This transparent pricing policy really seems to resonate with its users.\n\nThe one issue with Snowflake is the company's valuation. Don't get me wrong, CrowdStrike trades at an immense premium, but has seen its sales remain robust. Snowflake's revenue growth has slowed from the triple-digits three years ago to an estimated 22% in the current fiscal year. Snowflake is also valued at 115 times forward-year adjusted earnings, which is an even tougher pill to swallow for a company that's seen its sales growth slow from the triple digits.\n\nThough Snowflake looks to have a bright future, it could take some time before its operating performance grows into its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 36.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of 24.69%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $143.31 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $127.36 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAmazon shares have added about 19.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Amazon?\n\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.94 on $150.25 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.12 on $641.69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Solo Brands, Inc. (DTC), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 9.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -93.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nSolo Brands, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $80.48 million, down 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon on Tuesday reported strong results for the first quarter, driven by growth in its cloud-computing unit and a new surge of advertising dollars from its Prime Video streaming service.\n\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce giant said it brought in $143.31 billion in revenue in the first three months of this year, a 13% jump compared to the same period last year. Net income came out to $10.43 billion, or 98 cents per share. That soundly beat Wall Street analysts' expectations for 84 cents a share, according to FactSet.\n\n“It was a good start to the year across the business, and you can see that in both our customer experience improvements and financial results,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.\n\nThe nation’s biggest online retailer is coming off better-than-expected results for the holiday shopping period, when it saw strong consumer spending aided by discounts and faster shipping speeds. Amazon held another discount event in late March, right before the end of the first quarter.\n\nAside from its core retail business, Amazon said first-quarter sales in its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. amounted to $25.04 billion, up 17% from the same period last year.\n\nSales in the company's online advertising business also spiked 24%, partly driven by an influx of ad dollars coming from Prime Video. After years of giving Prime subscribers ad-free access to their favorite movies and TV shows, Amazon implemented a new policy in late January that lets viewers avoid ads only if they pay an additional $2.99 a month.\n\nShares in Amazon.com Inc. rose 3% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe company says it expects to post net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion during the second quarter. Analysts are expecting $150.2 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Walmart (WMT) announced it is closing down its healthcare business Tuesday. The move will impact 51 locations in five states, as well as relationships with health systems, like the one penned with Florida's Orlando Health in November.\n\nIn its announcement, Walmart cited a \"challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs\" as contributing to a \"lack of profitability that make the care business unsustainable for us at this time.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on the business segment's profitability, or lack thereof.\n\n\"We continually assess our business, once we made the decision, we moved quickly and with appropriate speed, which we believe was in the best interest of our associates, patients and communities,\" Walmart said in an emailed response.\n\nA spokesperson said the locations would likely close within a 45- to 90-day time frame. Walmart store in suburb north of Pittsburgh. (bgwalker via Getty Images)\n\nWalmart is just the latest in a string of retail healthcare pullbacks.\n\nWalgreens (WBA) announced that it will close 160 of its VillageMD clinics and only maintain the busiest sites, just a few years after investing $5.2 billion to acquire a majority stake in the business.\n\nAnd recently, UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) Optum division confirmed it was ending its telehealth services — which it started offering during the pandemic at no out-of-pocket cost to members.\n\nIndustry challenges\n\nCraig Garthwaite, health economist and professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that Walmart relied too heavily on its retail strategy in the more complex healthcare system.\n\nThe idea that \"we use our scale to cut costs, deliver lower prices to gain share — that's just not going to work given the cost structure of what they were involved with here,\" Garthwaite said.\n\nEven with the volume of customers Walmart has walking through its doors daily, and the various attempts to expand its health offerings over the years — including as an insurer — it couldn't crack the code.\n\nSachin Jain, president and CEO of SCAN Health Group, said in part there's a disconnect between the healthcare business and the needs of for-profit publicly traded companies that have to think about profit and increasing shareholder value every three months.\n\n\"It raises the question of whether there is this incompatibility between building a reliable ... primary care business and the public markets in an environment where rates are declining,\" Jain said.\n\nThe reimbursement rates from insurers and the federal government's Medicare program have been blamed for razor-thin margins in hospitals and in physician practices.\n\nStory continues\n\nStephen Klasko, a former hospital CEO and currently at General Catalyst, told Yahoo Finance he believes this could be a lesson for other retail efforts, such as Amazon's (AMZN) One Medical.\n\nIf a newcomer to the health space isn't thinking about how to operate as an insurer or as a pharmacy simultaneously, \"it just doesn't work financially,\" Klasko said.\n\nHe also added that if Walmart, with its scale and resources, could not make it, it's unlikely that retail health will ever take off.\n\nWalmart's stock was trading down 2% Tuesday, at just above $59 per share.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) reported first quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines, sending shares of the retail giant up as much as 5% in after hours trading.\n\nPowered by a strong showing from its cloud computing segment, Amazon continued a wave of Big Tech results that have mostly wowed Wall Street, even as investors turn their focus to the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of Amazon's most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal first quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nNet Sales: $143.3 billion vs. $142.6 billion expected ($127.4 billion in Q1 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $0.98 vs. $0.83 expected ($0.31 in Q1 2023) Amazon Web Services: $25 billion vs. $24.1 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q1 2023)\n\nAmazon's report arrived a week after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) posted an impressive quarter, beating expectations on the strength of its cloud computing business. The market cheered even louder for Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) results, which outperformed on the top and bottom lines and came with an announcement of a new dividend, the latest in a trend among tech giants.\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the race to claim market share and launch new consumer services. In March, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, pouring in another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\n\nLike its competitors Microsoft and Alphabet, Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\n\nAmazon's stock, which joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) in February, is up about 20% for the year.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

It’s very early days in all of our businesses and we remain excited by how much more we can make customers’ lives better and easier moving forward.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHighlights\n\nObsessing over the customer experience\n\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:\n\nContinued to delight customers with fast and convenient delivery. With more than 2 billion global units arriving the same or next day in Q1, Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Expanded selection across the company’s stores with the launch of popular brands. In the U.S., this included Gen Z favorite Parade; luxury fashion and accessories from AREA and HBX Archives by Hypebeast; beauty brands Clinique, Keys Soulcare by Alicia Keys, and LOVED01 by John Legend; tech brands Oura Ring and Sonos speakers; and officially-licensed products from the National Women’s Soccer League. In Europe, Luxury Stores at Amazon announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands.

Shared how customers and partners are using AWS generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) services to deliver new customer experiences, accelerate employee productivity, and transform operations.\n\nSiemens is integrating Amazon Bedrock into its low-code development platform Mendix to allow thousands of companies across multiple industries to create and upgrade applications with the power of generative AI. Philips is using AWS HealthImaging and Amazon Bedrock to scale digital pathology, helping labs and healthcare organizations improve diagnostics, increase productivity, accelerate research, and address complex medical cases, like cancer care. Accenture and Anthropic are collaborating with AWS to help organizations—especially those in highly-regulated industries like healthcare, public sector, banking, and insurance—responsibly adopt and scale generative AI technology with Amazon Bedrock. This collaboration will help organizations like the District of Columbia Department of Health speed innovation, improve customer service, and improve productivity, while keeping data private and secure. BT Group, a multinational communications company, provided Amazon Q Developer to 1,200 of its engineers, generating more than 100,000 lines of code in its first four months and automating approximately 12% of the repetitive and time-consuming work done by software engineers using the platform. The Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) named AWS the Official Generative AI Provider of the DFL, and is using AI on AWS to generate metadata that allows the league, clubs, and media partners to more efficiently search for content in more than 210,000 hours of video footage. Audi used Amazon SageMaker and Amazon OpenSearch Service to build a generative AI chatbot to improve its enterprise search experience and help employees find and navigate internal documentation, reducing search time from hours to a few seconds and improving productivity. Konica Minolta Healthcare, a medical diagnostic imaging and healthcare information technology company, announced an enterprise imaging cloud platform using AWS HealthImaging to reduce image storage costs, enable access from almost anywhere, and accelerate data retrieval. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute built a new research solution on Amazon Bedrock to help clinicians interpret complex lab results to help diagnose medical conditions, assess treatment efficacy, and determine next steps in clinical care. Enterprise healthcare software provider symplr announced a generative AI solution that uses Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q to connect and optimize hospital operations so clinicians and administrators can quickly access relevant data, simplifying staff scheduling and other administrative processes. Choice Hotels became the first hotel company to migrate its entire system infrastructure to the cloud. The move to AWS is part of Choice Hotels’ long-term technology roadmap and adoption of AI, and involves decommissioning more than 3,700 servers, retiring over 300 applications, and migrating more than 250 applications. Mobile network operator Tele2 launched an Internet of Things customer support solution, powered by Amazon Bedrock, to help agents provide faster and more detailed conversational responses to customers across multiple channels. Vonage, a cloud communications provider, announced a new anti-fraud solution with AWS generative AI capabilities to enable businesses to better protect themselves from mobile fraud while improving customer experiences. Genomics England, a human genome research organization, is using Amazon Bedrock to help researchers identify associations between genetic variants and medical conditions by quickly processing millions of pages of scientific literature, with the goal of informing future genetic tests and improving human health. AI biotechnology company Owkin selected AWS as its primary cloud provider to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and development, empowering scientists and researchers to access, analyze, and manage vast amounts of data efficiently and securely in the cloud. Parsyl, a data-powered insurer, is using Amazon Bedrock to turn unwieldy customer information, like email attachments in different formats, into usable data to help identify patterns of risk for businesses transporting goods. Continued to expand AWS’s infrastructure footprint to support customers by announcing:\n\nPlans to launch new infrastructure Regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in Mexico, which will give developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises greater choice for running their applications and serving end users. As part of AWS’s long-term commitment, it is planning to invest more than $5.3 billion in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and more than $5 billion in Mexico over the next several years. A planned investment of $10 billion to build two data center complexes in Mississippi. This investment, which is the single largest capital investment in the state’s history, will create at least 1,000 jobs and support new educational trainings in the state. The general availability of new AWS Local Zones in Atlanta, Chicago, and Houston. In Atlanta, AWS Local Zones support EC2 P5 instances, which deliver the highest performance for deep learning and high-performance computing applications. Announced that AWS began waiving charges for data transfer out to the internet (DTO) to give customers choice if they want to migrate their data outside of AWS. The waiver on DTO charges is available to all AWS customers around the world and from any AWS Region.\n\nInventing on behalf of customers\n\nAmazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:\n\nAnnounced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies’ internal data.\n\nOn the software development side, Amazon Q not only generates highly accurate code, but also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another (today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones; in the near future, Q will help developers transform their .net code as well). Q Developer Agents does multi-step planning and reasoning to allow developers to string together multiple requests and have Q implement them. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of data that reside in wikis, intranet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and many other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. Customers can point Q at all of its enterprise data repositories, and it’ll search this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with customers about this data. With the launch of a powerful new capability called Q Apps, employees can now describe, in natural language, what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This will make it much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Delivered a number of innovations in Amazon Bedrock (AWS’s generative AI service that enables customers to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure, high quality, low latency, cost-effective production generative AI apps). Tens of thousands of organizations worldwide are using Amazon Bedrock. These new Bedrock capabilities include:\n\nThe general availability of Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of vision-enabled foundation models (FMs)—Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku—which are the best performing models in the world right now and provide industry-leading accuracy, performance, speed, and cost. Claude 3 Opus has set a new standard, outperforming other models available today in the areas of reasoning, math, and coding. Amazon Bedrock became the first managed service to add Claude 3 models, and continues to provide customers with the widest choice of high-performing, fully-managed large language models (LLMs) and FMs. The general availability of Meta Llama 3 models, a collection of pretrained and instruction fine-tuned LLMs that come in two sizes—8B and 70B. The new models demonstrate significant improvements over previous versions due to vastly increased training data and scale. This collection of models supports a broad range of use cases, like text summarization and classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and code generation. The addition of FMs from leading AI startup Mistral AI. Mistral Large, the latest and most advanced LLM from Mistral AI, provides top-tier reasoning capabilities for complex multilingual reasoning tasks.

Guardrails offers industry-leading safety protection on top of the native capabilities of FMs, helping customers block up to 85% of harmful content. Guardrails is the only solution offered by a broad cloud provider that allows customers to have built-in and custom safeguards in a single offering, and it works with all LLMs in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models. The new Custom Model Import capability that makes it simple for customers to import models from SageMaker (or elsewhere) into Bedrock before deploying their application—enabling customers to take advantage of all the Bedrock features that make it so much easier to build high quality production-grade generative AI apps. Announced the extension of AWS and NVIDIA’s strategic collaboration to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs, helping customers unlock new generative AI capabilities. AWS will bring together NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell platform with AWS Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service advanced security, Elastic Fabric Adapter petabit-scale networking, and Amazon EC2 UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering, enabling customers to securely build and run multi-trillion parameter LLMs faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2. In addition, Project Ceiba, an AI supercomputer being jointly developed by AWS and NVIDIA exclusively on AWS for NVIDIA’s own AI research and development, will be built on the Blackwell platform. Continued to meet growing demand for AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, which help customers maximize performance and control costs for their machine learning (ML) workloads. Customers using these purpose-built AWS ML AI chips include Anthropic, Databricks, Leonardo.ai, Qualtrics, Ricoh, Stockmark, Watashiha, and Vyond. In addition, Meta's recently-launched Llama 3 model is running on Trainium and Inferentia2—delivering the lowest cost to train, fine tune, and deploy Llama 3 on AWS. Updated AWS Neuron (software that lets customers use popular frameworks like PyTorch to train and deploy models with minimal code changes on Amazon EC2 instances, powered by Trainium and Inferentia chips) to include features that further reduce costs for LLM inference for both external customers and internal teams at Amazon, such as Amazon Rufus. Continued to rollout Rufus in the Amazon Shopping app to millions of customers in the U.S. Rufus, in beta, is a new generative AI-powered shopping assistant that can help customers save time and make more informed purchase decisions by answering a variety of shopping-related questions, providing product comparisons, making recommendations, and more.

Announced plans to open Amazon Robotics fulfillment centers in Asturias, Spain and Sagamihara City, Japan, as part of Amazon’s commitment to design and deploy advanced technology that improves operational safety, employee experience, and customer delivery. The company now has Robotics fulfillment centers in 11 countries around the world, and they help improve workplace ergonomics, reduce heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, and enable employees to gain new skills.\n\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\n\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and communities. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\n\nLaunched a Disaster Relief Hub in Rheinberg, Germany—Amazon’s first Hub in Europe and the company’s 13th around the world. The 21,000-square-foot Hub allows Amazon to store and quickly pack relief items that are most needed following natural disasters and other emergencies. AWS also provided technology to support the nonprofit Help.NGO to fight wildfires in Chile and Colombia, including monitoring active fires, spotting new fires, and evaluating how best to help evacuated residents return to their homes. Since 2017, Amazon has used its global inventory, logistics infrastructure, and cloud technology to respond to more than 145 natural disasters and donate more than 24 million relief items globally. Increased funding for the AWS Health Equity Initiative by $20 million, bringing its commitment since the program launched in 2021 to $60 million. This program provides free cloud credits and technical expertise to help organizations harness the power of the cloud to advance global health. It has supported 263 organizations globally since 2021. Was named the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy by BloombergNEF for the fourth consecutive year. Amazon now has more than 500 wind and solar projects globally that are expected to generate more than 77,000 gigawatt-hours of clean energy each year—or enough to power 7.2 million U.S. homes. Announced that nearly half of all customer orders fulfilled in India are delivered in reduced or original packaging—meaning less packaging is needed to ensure the deliveries arrive safely, which is better for customers and the environment. Deliveries with reduced or no additional packaging are reaching customers in more than 300 cities across India, up from nine cities in 2019. Invested in Glacier, a women-led AI and robotics company that helps the recycling industry reduce waste by automating, sorting, and collecting real-time data on recycling streams. The investment is part of Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, and is the second woman CEO-led company that The Fund has invested in as part of its $53 million Female Founder Initiative, which launched in 2022 to close the funding gap for women in climate tech.\n\nFinancial Guidance\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 30, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Guidance\n\nNet sales are expected to be between $144.0 billion and $149.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with second quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from foreign exchange rates. In first quarter 2024 the impact from Leap Year added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year net sales growth rate. Operating income is expected to be between $10.0 billion and $14.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second quarter 2023. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\n\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\n\nAbout Amazon\n\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) exceeded Wall Street expectations in their latest quarterly results, driven by a surge in cloud revenue fueled by increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) services, Bloomberg reported. Alphabet’s shares soared up to 12%, marking its biggest gain since July 2015 and pushing its valuation past $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Microsoft rose as much as 3.5%. Still, there are some cloud computing stocks for investors to sell in this climate.\n\nThe bear case for these companies is that there could be high opportunity costs for holding onto them. Alternatives like MSFT and GOOG could prove to be too attractive. They offer the promise of high returns and being at the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these cloud computing stocks peaked during the pandemic and failed to return to Earth. That means they are still overvalued in comparison to their long-term growth potential. So here are three cloud computing stocks to avoid.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) may experience challenges in maintaining its rapid growth rate as its post-pandemic reality starts to sink in.\r\n\r\nZM reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations. Earnings at $1.42 per share on an adjusted basis were up 16% year-over-year while revenue reached $1.146 billion, a 2.6% increase from the previous year. This outperformance was attributed to the solid adoption of Zoom’s new Contact Center offering, upmarket traction, Zoom Phone and recent AI capabilities.\n\nStill, I believe that ZM’s valuation is presently too high to justify its stock price at around $62 per share. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is rich at 29.95 times earnings, not that much different from Microsoft at 35 times. Framing this is that MSFT’s growth potential is far higher according to analysts. Its revenue is expected to climb 17% while Zoom is only expected to rise around 5%.\n\nThe opportunity cost of holding onto ZM may be too steep when one compares what else the market has to offer, along with it being traded at a premium to its earnings.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) operates in a highly competitive cloud data warehousing market, facing challenges in differentiating its offerings and maintaining profitability.\n\nThe cloud data warehousing market is crowded with competitors like Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Redshift, Google BigQuery and Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse. These established players already have a significant market share and robust offerings, making it difficult for Snowflake to differentiate itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the underlying technology used in data warehousing solutions has become increasingly standardized. Many competitors offer similar features and functionalities, making an apple-to-apples comparison exceedingly easier.\n\nPerhaps due to SNOW’s lack of a durable competitive advantage, its earnings have been consistently negative. However, analysts expect it could break even within the next 12 months, but then its shares would trade at a high premium, as its forward price-to-sales ratio is 187 times earnings at the time of writing.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) faces concerns about intensifying competition in the cloud computing space.\n\nCompeting with major players like Microsoft and AWS requires Salesforce to continuously innovate and enhance its offerings to stay ahead. Unfortunately, considering who it’s up against, its top-line is unsustainable.\n\nCRM’s revenue growth peaked in 2019 and has gradually found a bottom. This bottom is not expected to be reached until FY2024, and even then that’s a speculative guess as it’s currently in free fall.\n\nCRM’s valuation is also very rich at 65 times earnings. Its balance sheet strength is also dicey with $14.19 billion in cash and $12.59 billion in debt.\n\nThere was a time that CRM dominated the cloud computing market in its respective niches. However, I think that those days are long over. It may earn a spot in one’s portfolio, but I think its high valuation makes it a prime target for an attack by short sellers, especially if the market goes thru a cyclical downturn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Google Announces Layoffs Across Key Teams As It Gears Up For I/O Developer Conference\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, ahead of its annual I/O developer conference in May, has confirmed layoffs across various vital teams such as Flutter, Dart, Python, and others, according to employee reports on social media.\n\nThe tech giant did not specify the teams, roles, or the number of individuals affected, TechCrunch reports.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Alex García-Kummert explained that these changes aim to align resources with the company’s most significant product priorities, improve efficiency, and reduce bureaucracy.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet Ramp Up AI Investments, Spend Over $32B in Q1\n\nThe layoffs are part of regular organizational adjustments and are not company-wide. Google encourages those affected to apply for other available positions within the company.\n\nDespite the cuts, Google PM Kevin Moore assured the Flutter development community that they are still focused on upcoming projects, including new updates for Flutter at the I/O conference.\n\nThe company has also filed a WARN notice in California, indicating the layoff of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.\n\nIn 2024, the tech sector surpassed last year’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs.\n\nThis comes after nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Discord, Salesforce Inc (NASDAQ:CRM), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) have announced significant layoffs in January.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory situation. Firstly, the rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.\n\nGOOG shares gained 56% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE:IXP) and The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).\n\nPrice Action: GOOG shares traded lower by 0.07% at $167.78 on the last check Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read: Google’s Strategic Job Cuts Reflect Ongoing Cost-Cutting Measures, Affecting Real Estate and Finance Departments\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google Announces Layoffs Across Key Teams As It Gears Up For I/O Developer Conference originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Equities related to the once-burgeoning hydrogen market are largely worth avoiding in 2024. The demand for renewable energy, especially one as expensive to produce and transport as hydrogen, has been rather for well over a year. While the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has catapulted investment into the space, tax credits and subsidies have not been as generous to hydrogen energy investments as they have been solar and wind. The Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ:HYDR) tracks 29 hydrogen companies that operate across various facets of the space, and this ETF has fallen more than 25% in 2024 alone. If we zoom out to over the past twelve months, HYDR has fallen 45% as of last Friday. This is a broader indication that investors should be wary of hydrogen stocks to avoid.\n\nIf a market crash occurs, which is still possible given the macroeconomics and the high valuation many U.S. equities boast, these are going to by the pure-play hydrogen stocks to avoid.\n\nBallard Power Systems (BLDP) a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tank\n\nSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.com\n\nBallard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) is the first pure-play hydrogen stock to avoid on this list. The company creates proton exchange membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells for larger vehicles, including trucks, busses and trains. While having industrial end-markets may seem because of their perceived stability, Ballard Power’s historical revenue growth has been anything but stable. 2023 saw Ballard Power report a 25% increase in top-line growth, but a year before revenues had declined by about that much. 2021 and 2020 also saw Ballard Power’s revenue growth just ebb and flow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, Ballard Power is also a perpetual loss maker, and given the lack of even growth in the green hydrogen space in general, investors can expect losses to continue accumulating in the future. Shares have already plummeted nearly 30% on a year-to-date basis. If rates stay elevated, investor risk appetite for green hydrogen projects could dry up, putting BLDP shareholders at risk.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has a number of notable similarities to Ballard Power. The hydrogen startup specializes in making hydrogen fuel cells, particularly for the mobility end-markets. This translates into fuel cells for forklifts, trucks and buses. Moreover, Plug Power has a keen focus on the logistics sector, which happens to be a fast-growing customer base. Whether or not this customer set continues to demand more hydrogen fuel cell products remains to be seen. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) count themselves amongst Plug Power’s customers, but it remains unclear whether or not these two logistics giants are just making surface-level commitments to green energy or serious ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlug Power’s revenue growth in the last two years has been in the solid double-digits, but its operating costs have ballooned out of proportion. So much that Citigroup has downgraded PLUG shares to “Sell” due to “limited liquidity, relatively high-cost structure, dilution from capital raises and tough competition.”\n\nFuelCell Energy (FCEL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US fuel cell company FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. Hydrogen Stocks to Avoid\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRather than developing hydrogen fuel cells and inserting them into renewable energy products, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) leverages fuel cells to develop stationary power generation for a number of customers. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a stable end-market for FuelCell’s power generating solutions. In the first quarter of 2024, FuelCell’s revenues followed the same downward trend they had in 2023. First quarter revenue contracted by 57% percent from $37.1 million to $16.7 million.\n\nSlowing growth and burgeoning costs are not what anyone wants to see in a start-up. Not mention, FuelCell Energy does trade below $1/share, which makes it both volatile and relatively illiquid. Stocks with slowing top-line growth are typically the first to get hit when a market crash occurs, so better to avoid FCEL now before markets get choppier.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Amazon Q Developer’s industry-leading coding accuracy, best-in-class security, and most comprehensive cloud capabilities allow developers to spend more time coding and less time on maintenance\n\nAmazon Q Business empowers employees to be more data-driven, generate content, build dashboards, and make better, faster decisions using company knowledge and data\n\nAmazon Q Apps, a new and powerful capability of Amazon Q Business, enables employees to use natural language to quickly and securely build their own generative AI applications to automate daily tasks\n\nCustomers and partners across all industries and of all sizes, including Accenture, BlackBerry, Brightcove, BT Group, Datadog, DAT Freight & Analytics, Deriv, Eviden, GitLab, GoDaddy, Hapag-Lloyd, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Persistent Systems, Showpad, Slalom, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Traeger Grills, Toyota, Wiz, and others are using Amazon Q to transform the way their employees get work done\n\nSEATTLE, April 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies’ internal data. Amazon Q not only generates highly accurate code, it also tests, debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities that can transform (e.g., perform java version upgrades) and implement new code generated from developer requests. Amazon Q also makes it easier for employees to get answers to questions across business data such as company policies, product information, business results, code base, employees, and many other topics by connecting to enterprise data repositories to summarize the data logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog about the data. Today, AWS is also introducing Amazon Q Apps, a new and powerful capability that lets employees build generative AI apps from their company’s data. Employees simply describe the type of app they want, in natural language, and Q Apps will quickly generate an app that accomplishes their desired task, helping them streamline and automate their daily work with ease and efficiency. To learn more about Amazon Q, visit aws.amazon.com/q.\n\n\"Amazon Q is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant available today with industry-leading accuracy, advanced agents capabilities, and best-in-class security that helps developers become more productive and helps business users to accelerate decision making,\" said Dr. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Artificial Intelligence and Data at AWS. \"Since we announced the service at re:Invent, we have been amazed at the productivity gains developers and business users have seen. Early indications signal Amazon Q could help our customers’ employees become more than 80% more productive at their jobs; and with the new features we’re planning on introducing in the future, we think this will only continue to grow.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Q Developer\n\nToday, developers tell us that only 30% (or less) of their time is spent on coding, while the rest is spent performing tedious and repetitive tasks. This could be researching best practices from various parts of the web or learning how things work through documentation, forums, and conversations with colleagues. Developers also have to manage infrastructure and resources, troubleshoot and resolve errors, and understand operating costs. When they switch projects, they have to spend time learning the existing code base to understand its programming logic. Finally, there is all the work of testing and refactoring code, upgrading applications, debugging and optimization, and ensuring security by having to carry out vulnerability scanning and applying appropriate security fixes in a timely fashion. Companies want to empower their developers to spend less time on this coding muck and more time on creating unique experiences for their end users, while being able to deploy faster.\n\nQ assists developers and IT professionals (IT pros) with all of their tasks—from coding, testing, and upgrading applications, to troubleshooting, performing security scanning and fixes, and optimizing AWS resources. Amazon Q delivers advanced and tailored generative AI capabilities, including:\n\nMost accurate coding recommendations: Amazon Q helps developers build faster and more securely by generating code suggestions and recommendations in near real time. Customers such as Blackberry, BT Group, and Toyota are already using Q to increase developer productivity and speed up innovation in their organizations. Amazon Q Developer has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry, for assistants that perform multi-line code suggestions, with BT Group recently sharing that they accepted 37% of Q’s code suggestions and National Australia Bank reporting 50% acceptance rates. Q also has a powerful customization capability that securely leverages a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations. With this capability, Q is an expert on your code and provides recommendations that are more relevant to save even more time. Q keeps customizations completely private, and the underlying foundation model (FM) does not use them for training, protecting customers’ valuable intellectual property. Amazon Q Developer Agents: Q has a unique capability, called agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks–everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code, to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature (such as asking it to create an \"add to favorites\" feature in a social sharing app), and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan before the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across source files, code blocks, and test suites. Carrying out these tasks, Q has achieved the highest scores of any software development assistant available today, scoring 13.4% on the SWE-Bench Leaderboard and 20.5% on the SWE-Bench Leaderboard (Lite), a dataset that benchmarks coding capabilities.\r\n\r\nTo save customers months, even years, of time upgrading applications, Q can also automate and manage the entire upgrade process–with Java conversions available today and .Net conversions coming soon to help people move from Windows to Linux. In their integrated development environment (IDE), developers simply ask Amazon Q to \"transform\" their project and the agent analyzes application source code, generates new code in the target language or version, executes tests, and completes all code changes. A five-person team at Amazon used Q to upgrade more than 1,000 production applications from Java 8 to Java 17 in just two days (the average time per application was less than 10 minutes), saving months of time, and improving application performance–previously, many of these applications would each take a couple of days to upgrade.\n\nBest-in-class security vulnerability scanning and remediation: Q scans code for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities, such as exposed credentials and log injection. With a single click, Q automatically suggests remediations tailored to the application code, allowing developers to quickly accept fixes with confidence. Q’s security scanning capabilities outperform leading publicly benchmarkable tools on detection across most of the popular programming languages, helping to significantly improve the security and code quality of a developer’s application. Q is an expert on AWS and optimizing your AWS environment: Amazon Q Developer is an expert on AWS and is in the console to help IT pros optimize their cloud environments, as well as diagnose and resolve errors and networking issues, select instances, optimize structured query language (SQL) queries, extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines, and provide guidance on architectural best practices. To further help customers optimize their cloud environments, today Amazon Q Developer includes a new feature that helps customers list their AWS account resources, configurations, and analyze billing information and trends, making it easier for them to manage their accounts. For example, IT pros can simply ask, \"What instances are currently running in US East 1?\" or \"What’s my S3 bucket encryption?\" or \"What were my EC2 costs by region last month?\" and Amazon Q Developer will list the resources and details in a summarized answer with links to learn more.\n\nAmazon Q’s conversational interface is available wherever it is needed—in the AWS Console, in Slack, or in IDEs, including Visual Studio Code and JetBrains–to give developers the ability to use the conversational experience of Q within their favorite software development solutions. To extend the Q experience to more places developers work, AWS is announcing new partner extensions from Datadog and Wiz, and an integration with GitLab Duo that will offer joint customers a unified interface—whether working in AWS or GitLab. By integrating Amazon Q’s generative AI capabilities with solutions that developers know, use, and trust, developers can update and create software faster.\n\nAmazon Q Business\n\nOrganizations possess vast amounts of data spread across multiple documents, systems, and applications. Employees across every organization and department spend hours every week searching internal sources for information, piecing together analyses, writing reports, building presentations, gathering insights from dashboards, and adapting content for different audiences. Generative AI can help solve these challenges. However, the offerings available today are not connected to business data or internal resources and are not built from the ground up with security in mind. Because of these barriers, many organizations cannot safely tap into the full potential of generative AI.\n\nQ Business is a generative AI–powered assistant that can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in your enterprise systems. It empowers employees to be more creative, data-driven, efficient, prepared, and productive:\n\nQ unites more data sources than any other generative AI assistant available today: Amazon Q Business easily and securely connects to 40+ commonly used business tools, such as wikis, intranets, Atlassian, Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)–more than any other generative AI assistant available today. Simply point Q at your enterprise data repositories, and it will search all of your data, summarize logically, analyze trends, and engage in dialog with end users about the data. This helps business users to access all of their data, no matter where it resides in their organization. Built from the ground up with security and privacy in mind: Amazon Q Business seamlessly integrates with a customer’s existing identities, roles, and access permissions to personalize the interactions for each individual user, while maintaining the highest levels of security. It generates accurate responses based on enterprise information, and customers can restrict sensitive topics, block keywords, and filter out inappropriate content. Q also does not use customer content to train the underlying models for anybody else. Amazon Q Business outperforms all published results for other assistants on correctness, truthfulness, and helpfulness for general Q&A (using the MultiHop-RAG dataset), as well as industries like finance (using a FiQA dataset sample) and technology (using a LoTTE dataset sample). Inventive generative BI allows analysts to build detailed dashboards in minutes and business users to get insights fast: Amazon Q brings its advanced generative AI technology to Amazon QuickSight, AWS’s unified Business Intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. With Amazon Q in QuickSight, customers get a Generative BI assistant that allows business analysts to use natural language to build BI dashboards in minutes and easily create visualizations and complex calculations. It is also the only BI product where business users can get AI-driven executive summaries of dashboards, ask questions of data beyond what is presented in the dashboards, and create detailed and customizable data stories highlighting key insights, trends, and drivers. Business users can ask to \"build a story about how the business has changed over the last month for a business review with leadership;\" and in seconds, Amazon Q creates a narrative with specific insights and supporting visuals, including specific ideas of how to improve the business. Users can choose to layout the content produced by Q in an easy to share document or presentation where they can customize text, images, and themes, and use Amazon Q to rewrite and improve the text. First-of-its-kind capability that helps every employee go from conversation to generative AI-powered app in seconds: Today, AWS is announcing the new Amazon Q Apps capability (in preview). Amazon Q Apps allows employees to easily and quickly create generative AI-powered apps based on their company data, without requiring any prior coding experience. With Q Apps, employees simply describe the app they want, in natural language, or they can take an existing conversation where Amazon Q Business helped them solve a problem, and with one click, Q will instantly generate an app that accomplishes their desired task that can be easily shared across their organization.\r\n\r\nFor example, creating employee onboarding plans for new recruits can be a long and laborious process. They require many hours of searching through different data stores and documents to find the appropriate content for the new employee; and often, the content is out of date or not specific enough to their role. With Q, an HR professional could simply describe they want an app that will create an onboarding plan for a new employee that utilizes the company’s existing best practices, and has an input field for employee ID that personalizes the onboarding plan to their role by drawing from internal data sources specific to their job family. In a matter of seconds, Amazon Q Apps will build an app that can automatically generate a personalized onboarding plan tailored to the employee, their role, and the department using the latest best practices. The HR professional can then share the app with hiring managers across the company to instantly build personalized onboarding plans for their own teams. Now, with Amazon Q Apps, business users can easily, quickly, and securely build an app based on enterprise information to improve their work productivity.\n\nWhat Amazon Q customers and partners are saying\n\nGoDaddy helps millions of entrepreneurs globally start, grow, and scale their businesses. \"Amazon Q in QuickSight allows us to ask our data contextual business questions without having to constantly rely on ad-hoc dashboards. For example, now we can much more easily discover and drill into anomalies in business performance across the company,\" said Ed Sarausad, senior director of Data & Analytics at GoDaddy. \"This shift not only streamlines our processes, but also elevates our analytical capabilities. What excites us most is the opportunity to unlock insights with profound, previously unasked questions. That allows us to respond more swiftly and with greater depth, enhancing our data learning journey.\"\n\nNational Australia Bank is one of the largest financial institutions in Australia. \"At NAB, teams across the bank are excited about how generative AI can transform our work, and we've found a great solution in Amazon Q Developer, a powerful generative AI-powered tool for our engineers and developers,\" said Andrew Brydon, executive chief engineer at National Australia Bank. \"The tool has seamlessly integrated advanced generative algorithms and tools into our development process, delivering unparalleled benefits like completing tasks faster, increasing productivity, and minimizing repetitive actions.

Since using Amazon Q Developer, our team has seen a strong code suggestion acceptance rate of 35%. This has allowed our engineers to efficiently generate high-quality code and documentation, implement new features, which can accelerate development cycles, and significantly reduce manual effort. We are excited about the impact of Amazon Q Developer on our development processes.\"\n\nNovacomp provides a diverse range of IT products and services while specializing in Quality Assurance Automation, Software Testing services and Nearshore Outsourcing. \"Modernizing applications at Novacomp has historically been a time-consuming task that is often de-prioritized against other development initiatives,\" said Gerardo Arroyo, CTO of Novacomp. \"Our team turned to Amazon Q Code Transformation to help upgrade a project running in Java 8 to Java 17 with over 10,000 lines of code. This is a task that would typically take an expert over two weeks to manually complete, but Amazon Q seamlessly modernized our project in a matter of minutes. Since adopting Amazon Q across our organization, we have realized a 60% decrease in average in our tech debt.\"\n\nPersistent Systems is a multi-national technology services company that builds software that drives digital transformation. \"Amazon Q Apps has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach generative AI,\" said Praveen Bhadada, head of generative AI at Persistent Systems. \"We can now empower everyone on the team to quickly build and integrate applications with a no-code approach, using enterprise data sources while carefully aligning with existing identities, roles, and authorization levels.\"\n\nSmartsheet is an enterprise software as a service offering for collaboration and work management. \"Amazon Q Business is streamlining knowledge management and accelerating employee productivity at Smartsheet,\" said Bani Bedi, senior vice president of corporate development and strategy at Smartsheet. \"Previously, it was too difficult for our 3,300 employees to find the information they needed across public help documents, training courses, and hundreds of all-employee Slack help channels. We have consolidated our organizational knowledge into a single AI engine to give our workforce immediate answers, significantly boosting employee productivity. Now, employees can simply tag @AskMe in any Slack channel, ask a question, and Amazon Q will instantly give them an answer. Our CEO uses Amazon Q Business to obtain answers and conduct research, getting the information that he needs without interrupting an employee’s workflow. We accomplished all of this in a couple of weeks and without writing a single line of code, using our existing identity system. Additionally, our engineering teams use Amazon Q to summarize incident statuses, identify action items, access API documentation, and troubleshoot technical issues more efficiently, so they can focus on delivering exceptional products to our customers.\"\n\nSun Life is a leading international financial services organization. \"Together with AWS, we're leveraging generative AI to help our people work more efficiently and deliver superior digital experiences to our clients,\" said Laura Money, EVP & chief information and technology innovation officer at Sun Life. \"Adopting Amazon Q Apps will enable our teams to build secure and seamless solutions that create value and differentiation across our business. For example, empowering our teams with access to Amazon Q in just a few clicks will streamline the creation and sharing of applications tailored to their respective needs.\"\n\nToyota Connected North America leads the development of Toyota’s cloud-based digital Connected Mobility Intelligence Platform. \"Toyota is committed to delivering exceptional digital experiences and continuously pushing boundaries for our customers. We realized that we needed to take a closer look at some of our supporting platforms, and evaluate architecture, tech debt, and needed upgrades, including our aging 4GL code repositories,\" said Dave Tsai, VP of engineering at Toyota Connected North America. \"Amazon Q Business provided our team insights into the areas of most critical need, accelerating the effectiveness of our technical debt assessment by 25%. With Amazon Q Developer's Code Transformation capability, we look to harness generative AIs increasing capabilities to accelerate applications and services upgrades by up to 30%.\"\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "title": "Here Are My 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution is in full swing, as evidence by the strong results reported by several big tech giants last week. There is perhaps no stronger medium-term tailwind than AI spending and investment; however, for investors putting money to work today, many AI-related stocks have soared this year, pricing in a very strong future.\n\nSo which are the best AI stocks to buy now? Perhaps those companies likely to benefit from the AI revolution, but which have either pulled back or trailed higher-profile peers based on near-term concerns.\n\nThat makes these three storied tech stocks prime pickups this week for your new AI investment dollars.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) plunged following its recent earnings report, but let's keep things in perspective. The stock had rallied some 50% at one point earlier this year, so it needed an absolutely perfect report to go higher.\n\nInstead, there were some legitimate concerns. Though Meta beat Q1 estimates, management guided somewhat conservatively, for \"only\" 18% growth in the coming quarter, a deceleration from last quarter's booming 27% growth. While revenue guidance came in a tad light, CEO Mark Zuckerberg actually increased his forecast for capital investments in artificial intelligence (AI) this year.\n\nLighter-than-expected revenue and increased spending is certainly a recipe for a sell-off. But that's probably shortsighted. After all, there's a good reason the company is ramping up AI investments this year. Not only are current AI investments benefiting Meta's core social media platform recommendation engines today, but Meta also has the potential to be an AI leader outside of its current core businesses. After all, its Llama 3 large language model has become a best-in-class LLM, especially in the open source community.\n\nMark Zuckerberg said on the conference call with analysts:\n\nSo with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. So that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data, and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf AI is really going to transform the world, Meta is one of only a handful of companies with the financial resources and talent to lead it. And it looks as though Zuckerberg isn't shying away from the opportunity.\n\nHe also has credibility here. Meta was doubted in being able to transition to mobile, then Stories, then Reels. But each time, Meta's investments paid off and the company was able to adapt to monetize the new opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta trades at only 22 times this year's estimates and about 19 times 2025 earnings estimates. Not only is that not a demanding valuation, but it also incorporates tens of billions in losses in the company's Reality Labs segment, which are running at a $15 billion loss rate. Meanwhile, investors don't seem to be counting on any payoff for that investment at all.\n\nBasically, the post-earnings dip is a great long-term opportunity for what could be the leading consumer AI company in the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhile Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) should benefit handsomely from the AI revolution, its stock only just getting back to its highs from 2021.\n\nBut could a breakout be in the cards? Amazon has been thought of as a laggard in the AI races, and its cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is currently growing at the slowest pace its competitors.\n\nBut those concerns may be overblown. After all, AWS is the largest cloud platform, so it's more difficult for it to grow at high rates compared with its smaller competitors. Moreover, Amazon has flexed its scale during the past downturn, in which customers asked to control costs, by lowering prices in exchange for longer-term commitments. And since Amazon is ahead of the game designing its own in-house processors called Graviton and its AI accelerators called Trainium and Inferentia, it's able to direct customer workloads to those lower-cost options when appropriate. Buy these undervalued AI stocks today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMoreover, Amazon offers perhaps the most diverse set of large language models from third parties in its Amazon Bedrock service, along with its own in-house LLM called Titan. And while Amazon missed out on investing in OpenAI, Amazon made a strategic $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic back in March. It's very early in the AI races, and it's quite possible OpenAI won't dominate the space even though it's the biggest private AI startup today.\n\nBedrock also continues to improve. Just last week, Amazon rolled out several new features. These include allowing businesses to create their own custom models and use that model from the same API as popular third-party models, a model evaluation and comparison tool that helps customers select the right model for their specific needs, and two new Titan models, one optimized for image generation and another optimized for question-and answer chatbots.\n\nFinally, generative AI has the potential to greatly advantage any business with lots of proprietary data. As the world's largest e-commerce retailer, Amazon will very likely utilize AI to improve its core e-commerce and advertising businesses, along with new scientific ventures like the Kuiper satellite broadband project. Amazon has a history of inventing new products and services that are difficult to build, so AI is likely to also greatly aid the company's innovation engine.\n\nIntel\n\nFor a higher-risk but much higher-reward pick in the AI space, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be an intriguing choice. Unlike other AI chip companies that have boomed, Intel's stock has badly lagged. Having fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) several years ago on process technology, which all of Intel's competitors use as their foundry, has really hurt its cause.\n\nBut CEO Pat Gelsinger has seemingly righted the ship, as Intel's \"five nodes in four years\" road map seems to be on track, with Intel hitting its innovation timelines over the past year-plus.\n\nOf course, the ambitious technology investment is taking a toll on Intel's bottom line, as it not only invests heavily in leading process technology for its own processors, but also builds out capabilities for third-party chipmakers to use its foundry.\n\nAll of the uncertainty on execution and the multiyear plan has caused investors to flee to the sidelines for now. That's especially true as Intel's core market, the PC market, seems to be recovering slowly from its post-pandemic downturn. But that's why Intel stock today can be bought at just 1.3 times book value.\n\nYet if Intel executes, there's a chance it could make big inroads into the AI chip market. Management now forecasts over $500 million of revenue from its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator in the second half of this year, which Intel claims outdoes even Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 on certain workloads. Even better, Intel believes that 2025 will see it catch up to rivals on process technology in CPUs, when it releases the Xeon processor Clearwater Forest. Gelsinger believes that chip may be able to handle some key AI inferencing tasks that may be more cost-effective for CPUs to do than GPU accelerators. And 2025 should also see Intel's introduction of \"Falcon Shores,\" which actually combines Gaudi and Xeon technology into an AI superchip with the potential to rival Nvidia's Grace-Hopper or Grace-Blackwell superchips.\n\nWill Intel really overtake Nvidia in AI computing anytime soon? Probably not. But at its market cap at a just $135 billion versus Nvidia's market cap of $2.2 trillion, Intel only has to make some mild share inroads in AI for the stock to work.\n\nWhile an investment in Intel is riskier than other AI players, as it's highly execution-dependent, it also has much higher potential rewards, should the Gelsinger turnaround plan work out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story)\n\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "AI stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) dominate the market with top-of-the-line chips that power the newest, most exciting AI software like ChatGPT. However, these stocks sit at a relatively high valuation, given the attention they have gathered from investors with recent performances.\n\nWhile there is certainly something to be said about their continued growth and ownership of shares, cheaper AI stocks are brimming with potential and a more solid runway supporting them in the coming years. These three AI stocks have excellent growth potential and are valued exceptionally well for investors looking to gain some considerable returns.\n\nLet’s learn more about these companies’ stakes in AI and how they are set up comfortably to grow and prosper in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a globally recognized processor company that has spent many years at the top of its market segment. The company recently showed it is not afraid to take leaps to stay ahead in today’s market. Primarily, Intel demonstrated its commitment to sticking with the times by launching its Gaudi 2 AI accelerator chips.\n\nAlthough the Gaudi 2 chips are somewhat below the high-spec standards set by competitors’ products, such as Nvidia’s B200 Blackwell chip, the company is not out of the race. Intel recently announced a comparison between its new Gaudi 3 chips and Nvidia’s H100, and the results are shocking.\n\nThe Gaudi 3 is reported to show 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency. In addition to these impressive statistics, Intel has had much better per-dollar performance in its chips. Intel’s products are more affordable than its competitors, opening it up to a broader market.\n\nThe company’s investments in bettering its chips and an already solid processing business give it an excellent foundation. Its first-quarter report included some mediocre results, causing a dip in its valuation. However, there is no denying Intel will become a major player and has excellent means for a considerable jump soon.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the best-performing stocks ever. Its momentum has been astonishing and continues to surge, reporting a 14% year-over-year (YoY) increase in net sales and an over $10 billion increase in operating income last quarter.\n\nWhile Amazon is not cheap, it is not valued as high as other AI stocks like Nvidia. The price becomes even more reasonable considering Amazon’s continued growth and expanding market share. Amazon is using its money to make heavy investments in the technology of the future, AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, Amazon has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading competitor of ChatGPT in generative AI. Amazon has also released its own AI service, Bedrock, a tool to assist developers in creating and shaping future generative AI applications.\n\nBedrock is part of Amazon’s cloud computing software, AWS, and further AI enhancements and additions will only improve its value to Amazon’s revenue streams. AWS brought in $24.2 billion last quarter, representing an increase of 13% YoY.\n\nAmazon is one of the companies with a very secure padding for continued investing in AI and will undoubtedly be an industry leader in the coming years.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) offers the latest and greatest technology in design software. The company’s unique selling point is its superior generative AI tools, which specialize in extremely high-quality 3D AI images.\n\nThe company’s CEO claims Autodesk’s tools are ten times faster and have much better quality than any other 3D image-generative AI. ADSK is also working on a shared platform that utilizes AI for designers at any point in the design process and allows seamless flow through operations and processes.\n\nAutodesk is still a relatively young company and has not finished its period of growing pains. Although the company reported an 11% revenue increase year-over-year last quarter, its margin has remained flat, and cash has slightly dipped.\n\nDespite the current fluctuations and ripples in Autodesk’s financials, the company is brimming with growth potential. It is in a great position to be at the forefront of generative AI design for years to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Retail Stock Rejects to Avoid at All Costs",
        "content": "In the era of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), many retailers have gone bankrupt because they could not compete with the e-commerce juggernaut. And of course, the pandemic-era lockdowns causing many retailers to become saddled with gargantuan debt did not help. In just the last several years multiple, once major, companies have all gone belly up. The most recent victim to file for Chapter 11 was Express (OTC:EXPR). It’s possible that, given the company’s reliance on selling clothes worn in offices, the work-from-home trend badly damaged the retailer. Express was also hurt by high debt and expensive leases. Here are three retailers that could easily be among the next to go bankrupt, making them retail stocks to avoid.\n\nStitch Fix (SFIX) Homepage of Stitch Fix (SFIX) website on the display of PC\n\nSource: Sharaf Maksumov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor any company, declining net customer totals is definitely a very bad sign. So the fact that Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX), which sells apparel online, lost a net total of 6% of its customer base in Q2 2024 is definitely a good reason to avoid SFIX stock. And compared with the same period a year earlier, Stitch Fix shed 17% of its users during the quarter.\r\n\r\nGiven the firm’s declining customer totals, I’m not surprised that its sales fell 17.5% year-over-year in Q2 .\n\nFor the third quarter, which ended on April 27, SFIX expects an adjusted EBITDA of potentially -$5 million. So it appears that the retailer may be heading into the red even on an adjusted EBITDA basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd indicating that the Street is losing patience with the name, the shares have tumbled 40% so far this year.\n\nPeloton (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome may dispute my decision to categorize Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) as a retailer. But since the firm does have physical stores and sell its products to consumers, I view it primarily as a retailer.\n\nLike Stitch Fix, Peloton’s customer base is shrinking which is never a good sign for any company. Specifically, in Peloton’s fiscal Q2 2024, its total membership declined 4% year-over-year (YOY) to 6.4 million. Meanwhile, its paid app subscription total fell 16% YOY to 718,000. And in another negative development, its top line dropped 6% YOY.\n\nOn a positive note, the amount of its cash burned by operating activities did sink 65% to $31.2 million in Q2. Still, given the meaningful declines of its customer base, I believe that the company will have difficulty shrinking its loss much further. That’s particularly true because the improvement in its cash burn was entirely due to a large, 14% YOY decline in its operating expenses. As is well known, the extent to which firms can cut their expenses is always limited.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeloton’s long-overdue decision to start selling its products through third parties, including Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Amazon, bore fruit, as Peloton’s revenue from those channels jumped 74% YOY in Q2. And its partnership with lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), established last September, could pay off too.\n\nBut given its continued, sizeable cash burn, revenue declines and customer losses, along with its $1.6 billion of net debt, I think that these positive moves will probably be a case of “too little, too late” for Peloton. This places PTON firmly among the retail stocks you will want to avoid.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nIn the wake of GameStop’s (NYSE:GME) poor Q4 results, investment bank Wedbush predicted that the retailer would not survive past 2029.\n\nThe bank believes that the firm’s top-line will probably sink by $150 million to $200 million annually, while GameStop will probably not be able to cut its costs sufficiently to compensate for those declines. The retailer’s main problem is that it does not appear to have found a way to compensate for its declining video-game sales, Wedbush explained.\n\nFor Q4, GameStop’s revenue came in at $1.078 billion, down from $1.186 billion during the same period a year earlier. Its operations burned a huge $203.7 million of cash during the quarter.\n\nGameStop’s declining revenue and poor outlook definitely make it one of the retail stocks to avoid at all costs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "While it’s not the most encouraging topic, should a severe market correction occur, forward-thinking contrarians may want to consider transportation stocks to buy. Yes, it’s a boring sector but there’s a method to the madness.\n\nFirst, the sector represents the real economy; that is, it’s where the rubber meets the road, literally and figuratively. Sure, the initial crash is painful for this and other industries. However, once the economy – because it always does – the transportation sector may be one of the first to experience gains.\n\nSecond and on a related note, the ecosystem enjoys permanent relevance. Modern societies are built on kinesis, not stasis. So, as long as any commercial activity exists, there will be a need for the movement of goods. On that note, below are transportation stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCSX (CSX) An image showing the front left of a blue, yellow, and grey train with a blue \"CSX\" on the front, with gravel, leafless trees, and an overcast sky in the background.\n\nSource: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top transportation stocks to buy, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) provides rail-based freight transportation services. Per its public profile, CSX specializes in the transporting of intermodal containers and trailers along with other sector-related services. These include rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. While shares got off to a solid start earlier this year, in the past month, CSX stock slipped almost 8%.\n\nFinancially, the company isn’t setting new performance benchmarks. However, it is a consistent player, doing what it needs to. In the past four quarters, CSX’s average positive earnings surprise comes out to 1.13%. Profitability is one of the core strengths, with the company delivering a net margin of 24.75%. That’s above 88.79% of the competition.\n\nStill, in fairness, investors are paying for the consistency, with a forward earnings multiple of 17.42X. That’s above the sector median 12.82X. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate a high-side earnings per share of $2.02. That’s a decent lift from last year’s result of $1.85. As a result, CSX could be a solid candidate for transportation stocks to buy.\n\nKnight-Swift Transportation (KNX) Knight Transportation truck\n\nSource: Thomas Trompeter / Shutterstock.com\n\nA well-recognized name in the freight transportation service industry, Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) operates through four segments: Truckload, Less-than-truckload (LTL), Logistics and Intermodal. While KNX stock is a relevant idea, it’s also risky. Since the start of the year, shares stumbled more than 18%. Nevertheless, for speculators targeting a big discount, KNX could soon be intriguing.\n\nTo be fair, the company has been all over the map in terms of its financial performance. For example, in the first quarter of this year, Knight-Swift posted EPS of 12 cents. That was well off the expected print of 20 cents. So, the red ink is justified. Still, with shares getting a beating, KNX is now trading at 1.07X book value. That seems a little light.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrue, the expected EPS for fiscal 2024 only comes out to $1.45. That’s a far cry from the anticipated $1.72. Still, the most optimistic analyst believes EPS of $2.53 is possible. For fiscal 2025, this bottom-line metric could rise to $3.99. Also, 2025 sales could reach $9.11 billion. It’s a long shot but worth keeping on the radar.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile one of the most recognizable transportation stocks to buy, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) also faces competitive concerns. As well, the company – like the other transportation players – depends heavily on consumer sentiment. That said, businesses evolve, FedEx courier services – such as its overnight deliveries – could witness demand expansion.\n\nOf course, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) investing in its own delivery service, the matter has clouded FedEx and its rivals. Still, it’s also possible that the burgeoning gig economy could boost sales for FedEx. The company’s performance over the past four quarters reflects that FDX isn’t entirely a lost cause. Even with an earnings miss in the quarter ended Nov. 30, the average quarterly surprise came out to 7.6%.\n\nCurrently, FDX trades at 12.24X forward earnings, which is decent. That’s with an expected EPS target of $17.80 by the end of fiscal 2024. It’s also possible that on the high end, EPS could land at $18.10 and $23.30 in fiscal 2025. If you want to gamble, FDX could be an interesting idea for transportation stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 30, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE and Marriott International, Inc. MAR.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Alphabet and Amazon.com\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc. and Marriott International, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "5 of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Pay a Dividend. In Mere Hours, a New Member May Join the Club",
        "content": "Following a volatile start to the decade, the bulls are, once again, running wild on Wall Street. Despite a modest pullback, investors have witnessed the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite jump to record-closing highs within the last five weeks.\n\nWhile there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors since this new bull market took shape, the Magnificent Seven have done the lion's share of the heavy lifting. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are long-term outperformers with well-defined competitive advantages\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of Wall Street's largest and most-influential businesses. Listed in descending order by market cap, as of the closing bell on April 26, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nAside from all seven of these companies crushing the S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, their lure, from an investment standpoint, is their competitive advantages and/or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging the old with the new. Windows is still the world's leading operating system for desktops, while Azure is the global No. 2 cloud-infrastructure service platform. Apple's calling card to success has long been its iPhone, which accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to make up in the neighborhood of 90% of the GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet's Google comprised more than 91% of global internet-search share in March, while streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world. Amazon's online marketplace is No. 1 in the U.S., with an estimated 37.6% of domestic online retail share in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud-infrastructure service platform. Meta Platforms owns the top social media sites globally, including Facebook, which attract more than 3.2 billion daily active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nBut there's a new draw to the Magnificent Seven that didn't exist when 2024 began: Most of these companies now pay a dividend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay a regular dividend to their shareholders\n\nWhen most investors think of the Magnificent Seven, they probably envision Wall Street's steadiest growth stocks. With these businesses aggressively reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth segments and innovations, collecting dividend income is likely an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, operating cash flow has been so robust for most of these companies that paying a regular dividend can be done without hampering their innovative capacity in any way.\n\nEntering 2024, three Magnificent Seven constituents had been paying a dividend to their shareholders for years.\n\nMicrosoft has been paying a continuous quarterly dividend since September 2004 and has seen its payout grow by more than 800% since its dividend program was first initiated. Apple reinstated its quarterly-dividend program in the summer of 2012 and has increased its payout by 154% in under 12 years. Nvidia has paid what currently amounts to a token dividend ($0.04 per quarter) dating back to the summer of 2013.\n\nIn February, Meta Platforms joined the party when its board introduced a $0.50 per-quarter distribution. Even with aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality devices, and the metaverse, Meta closed out the March quarter with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated over $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations during the quarter. It has the balance sheet and capital to support a continuous payout to its shareholders.\n\nLast week, Alphabet became the newest member of the club. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and now-profitable cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, initiated a $0.20 per-quarter dividend. Alphabet ended March with over $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated an astounding $28.8 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of the new year. It can easily absorb this annual payout while fueling its cloud and AI-driven ambitions.\n\nLater today, Tuesday, April 30, a sixth member of the Magnificent Seven has an opportunity to join the club.\n\nIs this the newest dividend-paying Magnificent Seven stock?\n\nLast week, Tesla's operating results made it plainly evident that it won't be doling out a dividend anytime soon to its shareholders. Tesla endured a free-cash outflow of $2.53 billion during the first quarter, with EV competition heating up and multiple rounds of price cuts wrecking the company's operating margin. Selling a commoditized product in a cyclical industry might make it difficult for Tesla to ever pay a dividend.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven component that could become the newest dividend paying stock in mere hours is Amazon -- the company is slated to report its first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today.\n\nWith Amazon stock trading at a multiple of 62 times trailing-12-month earnings, you might be quick to dismiss the likelihood of the company doling out a dividend to its shareholders. However, Amazon's balance sheet, and its three ancillary operating segments that are bona fide cash machines, suggest it can become the next income stock.\n\nWhen the curtain closed on 2023, Amazon was sitting on a treasure chest of nearly $86.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. More importantly, net cash provided by operating activities soared to nearly $85 billion in 2023 from $46.8 billion in the previous year. By 2027, Amazon's three higher-margin ancillary segments -- AWS, advertising services, and subscription services -- are expected to more than double the company's 2023 operating cash flow.\n\nAlthough advertising can be cyclical, Amazon's operating cash flow is fairly insulated against downturns in the U.S. and global economy. While e-commerce generates most of its revenue, the online marketplace is a low-margin segment. The predictability of subscription-services revenue, coupled with enterprise cloud spending still being early in its ramp, all but ensures that Amazon will have more capital than it'll know what to do with.\n\nDon't overlook peer pressure as a catalyst, either. With Meta and Alphabet introducing a dividend over the last three months, Amazon may have little choice but to follow suit in order to maintain its seat at the table among America's most-influential businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year. Its share price surged 239% as artificial intelligence (AI) whipped Wall Street into a frenzy.\n\nHowever, several hedge fund billionaires began diversifying away from Nvidia in the fourth quarter, while purchasing shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 873,000 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 99%. He simultaneously increased his stake in Amazon by more than 1,000%, such that it now ranks as his third-largest position.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%. He simultaneously increased his stake in Amazon by 1%, such that it now ranks as his fourth-largest position (excluding options).\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%. He simultaneously increased his stake in Amazon by 11%, such that it now ranks as his largest position (excluding options).\n\nThe trades made by Englander and Cohen are especially noteworthy because they run two of the most successful hedge funds in history. Specifically, as of December 2023, Millennium Management ranked No. 2 and Point72 Asset Management ranked No. 13 in terms of net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments.\n\nHowever, investors should not interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment. None of the fund managers completely closed their positions in the AI chipmaker, but rather reduced their stakes and reallocated capital to other AI stocks, including Amazon.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, Amazon operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales, but the company is still gaining market share. Morgan Stanley analysts expect Amazon to surpass Alibaba and lead the world in retail e-commerce sales by 2027.\n\nStrength in retail has naturally led Amazon to dominate the retail advertising market, so much so that it ranks as the third-largest adtech company in the world, behind Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. However, Amazon is taking market share more quickly than Meta, and Google is actually losing ground, according to eMarketer.\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) still dominates the market for cloud infrastructure and platform services, despite losing 2 points of market share to second-place Microsoft Azure in the fourth quarter. That means Amazon is uniquely positioned to benefit as businesses adopt cloud infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI) projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence to strengthen its market presence\n\nLike many leaders, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sees artificial intelligence (especially generative AI) as a game-changing technology. \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which, itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the internet,\" he wrote in his latest shareholder letter.\n\nNaturally, Amazon is using artificial intelligence to strengthen its competitive position across its three primary business segments.\n\nE-commerce: In February, Amazon debuted a generative AI shopping assistant called Rufus. It was initially made available to a subset of U.S. consumers via the Amazon mobile app, but Rufus is now rolling out to a wider audience. Think of Rufus as an assistant that answers questions and makes recommendations based on the Amazon product catalog, customer reviews, and information across the web. Additionally, Amazon is also using machine learning models to optimize warehouse inventory and last-mile delivery, both of which make its logistics business more efficient. Digital advertising: Amazon recently introduced a generative AI tool that lets brands create relevant and engaging lifestyle images featuring their products, which ultimately helps them run more cost-effective advertising campaigns. Notably, among media buyers that struggle to create successful campaigns, 75% cite generating creative content as their biggest challenge. Amazon solves that pain point with its new AI-powered image generator. Cloud computing: Amazon Web Services ranked third behind OpenAI and Microsoft in generative AI market share last year, but product development at every layer of the AI stack could help it gain ground. At the infrastructure layer, custom chips for AI training and inference offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia GPUs. At the platform layer, Bedrock lets businesses build custom generative AI applications. And at the application layer, Amazon Q automates tasks for nontechnical workers and software developers.\n\nInvestors should watch AWS closely. Amazon is projected to gain market share in e-commerce and digital advertising, but Microsoft has quickly become a formidable competitor in the cloud, due in part to its exclusive partnership with OpenAI.\n\nAmazon is a good stock to buy right now\n\nStraits Research says online retail sales will increase at 8% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Grand View Research believes digital advertising and cloud computing sales will increase at annual rates of 15% and 14%, respectively. Finally, Bloomberg expects generative AI spending to compound at 48% annually during the same period.\n\nCollectively, that gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 3.3 times sales look reasonable.

        "content": "Amazon is set to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nE-commerce firm Amazon is set to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday in what will be a closely watched quarter for tech companies' progress in the AI sector.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street expect revenue of $142.6bn (£113.8bn) versus the $127.4bn in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share are predicted at $0.82, more than double the $0.31 in Q1 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, online stores, Amazon Web Services and advertising are all expected to have grown.\n\nThe company has said it sees the potential for AI initiatives to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders earlier this month: \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nRead more: Amazon earnings preview: AI initiatives expected to take focus\n\nLike its competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\n\nSimilar to other deals between tech giants and AI-focused companies, Amazon's partnership with Anthropic comes with a commitment to use its cloud computing services — highlighting an advantage of trillion-dollar companies as they attempt to dominate the coming AI era.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla stock finished more than 15% higher on Monday ahead of news that CEO Elon Musk has reportedly shaken up its top ranks and set layoffs in motion. According to a report by The Information, which saw internal documents, Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of new products are set to leave.\n\nMeanwhile all employees that report to Ho and Tinucci will be laid off, the report added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe news comes following reports that the company has clinched key approvals in China to introduce the company's self-driving software to the market.\n\nReuters reported on Monday, citing two sources, that, Tesla had reached an agreement with Baidu (BIDU) to use the Chinese tech firm's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe collection and storage of Chinese data, and how much of it is allowed back into the US has been a key concern for years with the interaction of US companies on Chinese soil, or visa versa.\n\nMusk is looking to obtain approval to transfer data collected in the country abroad to train algorithms for its autonomous driving technologies, a source told Reuters.\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nElectronics firm Samsung beat earnings estimates as its chip division returned to profit, reporting a net income for that division of 6.62 trillion won ($4.8bn) in the quarter to the end of March, versus the average analyst projection for 5.63 trillion won. It more than quadrupled its earnings from a year earlier off the back of the AI boom.\n\nRead more: HSBC beats estimates and announces buyback as CEO retires unexpectedly\n\nThe company's fortunes have been buffeted by macroeconomic uncertainty in recent years, with heavy losses in 2023 in its semiconductor unit. However, demand for chips is higher than ever, with the rise of companies hoping to cash in on the wave of AI innovation which has been led by the likes of OpenAI.\n\nSamsung said it expects chip demand to remain strong in the current quarter and the second half of this year.\n\nMercedes-Benz (MBG.DE)\n\nLuxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz left its guidance unchanged for the year and said it would continue share buybacks as its earnings dropped 34% in the first quarter.\n\nPoor demand for electric vehicles was behind the lag, with earnings before interest and tax dropping to $3.9bn.\n\nThe company expects an increase in sales in the coming quarters, with an improvement in the Chinese market.\n\nWhitbread (WTB.L)\n\nWhitbread stock gained more than 1% in early trade in London on Tuesday as the Premier Inn owner announced it would close restaurant chains and cut 1,500 jobs. Whitbread will sell 126 of its less profitable branded restaurants, while job cuts are still being decided with a consultation process having been launched.\n\nThe closures come in favour of building more hotel rooms, the company said. The latest results show pre-tax profit rose 21% to £452m for the year ending 29 February.\n\nWatch: Amazon earnings: All eyes on cloud growth for AWS?<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AMZN</a>) will report its first quarter earnings alongside other tech giants like Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AAPL</a>) this week. Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination to discuss Amazon's upcoming earnings and why investors should pay attention to how Amazon Web Services performs.</p>\\n<p>On what to expect with AWS, Bajarin states: \\\"Everybody is going to be looking at cloud growth for AWS. Right now,  it's super trendy to talk about CapEx, everyone wants to see what the hyperscalers are spending in terms of new infrastructure, buying AI servers, creating 'AI factories,' as Nvidia (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">NVDA</a>) likes to call them. I think that's what's going to be a big spotlight, what Amazon's growth is doing in terms of AWS. I think it's probably predictable it will be healthy, somewhat double-digit. Where are they going, where are they guiding, and what CapEx are they investing?\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-stock-jumps-questions-swirl-173004158.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Market Domination.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/nicholas-jacobino/\\\"><em>Nicholas Jacobino</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ojQ4EK0Q2WwROBJmG5y2Ug--~B/aD0xODgyO3c9MzM0MzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/3b9c7e70-0665-11ef-affd-628f05debcd2\",\"duration\":\"PT1M53S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/05ce041c-9e01-3402-83b4-7857b8b1e31d.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-earnings-eyes-cloud-growth-205340999.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"05ce041c-9e01-3402-83b4-7857b8b1e31d\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Amid a buoyant U.S. stock market, where investors are keenly analyzing first-quarter earnings and anticipating key economic events like the Federal Reserve meeting, certain growth companies with high insider ownership stand out.

The company's revenue is expected to grow at 9.9% annually, slightly above the US market average but well below high-growth benchmarks. Earnings are anticipated to increase significantly, with forecasts suggesting a 21.7% annual rise over the next three years—outpacing general market projections. However, Amazon's Return on Equity (ROE) is projected to remain modest at 17.9%. Recent shareholder activism highlights ongoing demands for greater transparency and responsibility in environmental and human rights practices, reflecting both challenges and engagement opportunities for investors focused on corporate governance.\n\nClick here and access our complete growth analysis report to understand the dynamics of Amazon.com.

The company's revenue and earnings are expected to grow at an impressive rate of 20.8% and 23% per year respectively, outpacing the US market forecasts significantly.\n\nGet an in-depth perspective on PDD Holdings' performance by reading our analyst estimates report here.

(SMCI) exhibits strong growth prospects with earnings forecasted to increase by 34% annually over the next three years, outstripping the US market's expected 14.7% growth rate. Despite a volatile share price recently, SMCI's revenue is also set to expand significantly at 24.8% per year.

        "title": "Time to Buy Amazon's Stock as Q1 Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "After Alphabet’s GOOGL exhilarating quarterly results last week, Wall Street will be eying its big tech peer and cloud computing rival Amazon’s AMZN Q1 report on Tuesday, April 30.\n\nMore so than Alphabet, Amazon’s stock has been on an ascending course to hit $200 a share after their 20-for-1 stock splits in 2022 and investors may be wondering if it's time to buy as earnings approach.\n\nQ1 Preview\n\nAmazon’s Q1 earnings are thought to come in at $0.81 per share which would be a 161% increase from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, Q1 sales are projected to rise 12% to $142.55 billion.\n\nNotably, Amazon has exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for five consecutive quarters and has posted an impressive average earnings surprise of 51.04% in its last four quarterly reports. Furthermore, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Amazon could exceed earnings expectations again with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q1 EPS at $0.87 and 7% above the Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud Expansion\n\nOutside of its commanding e-commerce business, Amazon’s AWS still controls the primary share of the domestic cloud computing market ahead of Microsoft’s MSFT Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud. According to Zacks estimates, AWS segment sales are expected to rise 13% to $24.25 billion versus $21.35 billion in Q1 2023.\n\nEdging Towards $200 a Share\n\nAmazon’s stock has risen +19% this year with a current stock price of $180 a share and has matched Alphabet’s YTD performance with GOOGL having a current price of $166. Over the last year, AMZN has now soared +77% to slightly top GOOGL at +55%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nThe catalyst for Amazon’s stock edging closer to $200 a share has been the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions. Over the last 60 days, fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates have now risen 1% and 2% respectively, and are slightly up in the last week.\n\nEven better, Amazon’s annual earnings are currently projected to rise 42% this year to $4.12 per share with another 31% EPS growth expected in FY25. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmazon’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). To that point, the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions ahead of its Q1 report is compelling along with the Zack ESP suggesting the Magnificent Seven titan should top bottom line expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon earnings preview: AI initiatives expected to take focus",
        "content": "Amazon is scheduled to post quarterly earnings after the bell on Tuesday, continuing a wave of Big Tech results that have so far wowed Wall Street but also flashed a warning of some impatience with heavy AI spending. The company is expected to offer updates on the progress of its AI development, the state of its lucrative cloud business, and the growth of its advertising segment.\n\nAmazon's report will arrive a week after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) posted an impressive quarter, beating expectations on the strength of its cloud computing business. The market cheered even louder for Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) results, which outperformed on the top and bottom lines and came with an announcement of a new dividend, the latest in a trend among tech giants.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Amazon's most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue: $142.6 billion expected ($127.4 billion in Q1 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $0.82 expected ($0.31 in Q1 2023) Online Stores: $54.8 billion expected ($51.1 billion in Q1 2023) Amazon Web Services: $24.1 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q1 2023) Advertising: $11.8 billion expected ($9.5 billion in Q1 2023)\n\nAmazon sees the potential for AI initiatives to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. CEO Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders earlier this month, \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the race to claim market share and launch new consumer services. In March, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, pouring in another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\n\nLike its competitors Microsoft and Alphabet, Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\n\nSimilar to other deals between tech giants and AI-focused companies, Amazon's partnership with Anthropic comes with a commitment to use its cloud computing services — highlighting an advantage of trillion-dollar companies as they attempt to dominate the coming AI era.\n\nAmazon is the biggest player in the cloud industry. Amazon Web Services claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn September, Amazon launched its AI service, called Amazon Bedrock, allowing customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself.\n\nBut Amazon's commitment to AI progress has also come amid downsizing.\n\nAmazon said earlier this month it’s cutting hundreds of jobs in AWS as its most profitable business shows signs of slowing sales.\n\nThe latest round of cuts arrived as the company dealt with other setbacks. Amazon moved to end its cashier-less checkout systems at its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in the US.\n\nThe retail giant is also drawing increasing competition on its home turf. E-commerce companies Temu and Shein pose growing threats to Amazon's empire of online shopping.\n\nAnalysts point to other areas of growth as bright spots for Amazon. At nearly 15% market share, the company's advertising business claims the No. 3 spot behind longtime digital ad leaders Google and Meta (META).\n\nThe company's nascent Prime Video ads business has major potential for growth, Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a preview note Sunday. They pointed to Amazon's vast resources, troves of consumer data, and Prime Video's broad reach as factors that could drive the new ad platform's expansion. Amazon rolled out an ad-supported plan to audiences in January.\n\nAmazon's earnings report will arrive just before the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting. The market widely expects the central bank to hold interest rates steady. But new hints at when the Fed might start easing rates, if at all, will have an impact on Amazon and other major tech stocks that have powered this month's equity rally.\n\nThe company's stock, which joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) in February, is up about 20% for the year.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Woes Are Your Windfall: 3 AI Stocks to Grab Now",
        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia’s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock’s foundation’s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment’s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker’s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm’s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta’s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world’s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML’s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: April Edition",
        "content": "After a momentous rally in tech stocks over the past several months, the market’s now in correction territory. With many of the biggest tech stocks notching higher highs during the first quarter (Q1) of the year, many had predicted a stock market breather. However, the pullback presents an excellent opportunity for investors to hunt for multibagger tech stocks.\n\nInvesting in the stock market plan without a clear strategy can be incredibly daunting. It’s like being a kid at a candy store with thousands of options. In such a case, investors must narrow down sectors with the most promise for long-term expansion. Betting on long-term trends, especially in the tech space, can potentially generate tremendous gains. With that in mind, I’ve curated a list of potential multibagger tech stocks targeting three of the biggest investing trends in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and resource management.\n\nMultibagger Tech Stocks: SoundHound (SOUN) A sign for SoundHound AI (SOUN) out front of an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a frontrunner in conversational AI, a market poised for colossal expansion over the next few years. It has established a firm foothold in the market, growing rapidly in recent quarters. Moreover, its client list is an exhaustive catalog of the who’s who in tech, telecommunications, dining, and transportation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSOUN stock soared in mid-February, propelled by the news of AI giant Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) ownership position in the firm. Despite a significant pullback in the past month, losing over 30% of its value, the stock has shown resilience. The dip, largely attributed to the company’s plans to sell up to $150 million in new stock, has been met with optimism by analysts who project a potential 23% upside in SOUN stock.\n\nFurthermore, the upside in its stock is also linked to its robust growth trajectory over the next couple of years. The company expects fiscal 2024 sales to fall in the $63 million to $77 million range, beating analyst estimates of $69.73 million at the mid-point. Looking to fiscal 2025, SoundHound expects sales to top an impressive $100 million while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be positive.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM)is an industrial robotics specialist managing supply chains within large warehouse environments. It makes use of robotics and AI to effectively manage distribution center operations with greater efficiency.\n\nThe industrial robotics market is a robust trend in the tech space, demonstrating substantial growth on a global scale. To provide a clear picture, the market was valued at $17 billion in 2023, and is projected to potentially reach $32.5 billion by 2028. A staggering statistic is the total number of robots produced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which skyrocketed by 7,400% to 750,000 from 2013 to 2023. Furthermore, robots handle approximately 75% of all products in Amazon, underscoring the industry’s potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, industry leaders such as Symbotic should benefit immensely from the trend. Its Q1 2024 results showed a 79% increase in sales from the prior-year period. What’s more impressive is that its net loss of $68 million in Q1 2023 dropped by a massive 81% to $13 million in Q1 2024.\n\nItron (ITRI) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Itron, Inc. (ITRI) logo\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nItron (NASDAQ:ITRI) is a tech company that’s developing products and services aimed at managing energy and water resources. Needless to say, it is addressing one of the biggest long-term trends in the management of critical resources. Itron’s innovations in resource management could be pivotal in dealing with the global demand for energy and water.\n\nItron is an excellent stock to invest in overall. It has bounced back impressively from the pandemic-led slowdown to deliver robust sales and earnings growth last year. Moreover, its net income is now firmly in the green after three challenging years of posting net losses. Consequently, ITRI stock shot up more than 79% last year and is up 25% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming the broader market. Despite the ascent though, ITRI stock still trades just 1.85 times forward sales estimates, 35% lower than the sector median. Moreover, Tiprank’s analysts assign a ‘strong buy’ rating to ITRI stock, with a 13% upside from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges",
        "content": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) issued its third quarter earnings report.\n\nYear to date, Microsoft shares are 10% up, behind its tech rivals, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) that are 15% and 22% up, respectively, with the three locked in a battle to show who can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions.\n\nThis week, Microsoft got a pleasant boost from the beverage giant, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) who agreed to infuse Microsoft’s  Azure cloud services and developing AI technology across its business and network.\n\nThird quarter results surpassed estimates.\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, revenue rose 17% YoY to $61.86 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $60.80 billion.\n\nNet income amounted to $21.94 billion or $2.94 per share and also surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $2.82 per share.\n\nOverall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s guidance for $33.93 billion. Intelligent Cloud segment brought in $26.71 billion as sales rose about 21% with Microsoft’s Azure cloud alone growing 31%. AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, rising from second quarter’s 6 percentage points and first quarter’s 3 percentage points.\n\nCapital expenditures jumped 79% to $14 billion. Microsoft has been investing heavily to secure Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units it needs to develop and train AI models. But even with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center infrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models. CFO Amy Hood noted that AI demand could outstrip available capacity in the near-term. Microsoft is certainly not the only AI vendor with this challenge as Nvidia is facing the same issue. Fueled by the AI boom, Nvidia reported its revenue more than tripled over consecutive quarters. Microsoft, being one of its customers, is simply now feeling the stress Nvidia has been facing for a while due to insatiable AI demand. Only a month ago, Microsoft and Nvidia deepened their longstanding collaboration by announcing major integrations to accelerate the development of generative AI for enterprises.\n\nMore Personal Computing revenue rose 18% YoY to $15.58, surpassing StreetAccount consensus of $15.08 billion.  It was driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers, along with 62% growth in sales of Xbox content and services, with 61% being attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's October acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nStory continues\n\nPC demand was slightly better than expected during the quarter and consequently, sales of Windows licenses to device makers rose 11%.\n\nThe Productivity and Business Processes unit that hosts Office software and LinkedIn, among others, reported a revenue rise of 12% as sales amounted to $19.57 billion. This is first full quarter of the Copilot-add-on sales, on which Microsoft invested billions to develop.\n\nFourth quarter guidance was not as impressive.\n\nMicrosoft guided for revenue from $63.5 billion to $64.5 billion in the current quarter. Hood guided for a material rise in capital expenditures due to cloud infrastructure both in the current quarter and in the new fiscal year that will kick off on July 1st.\n\nThe boost from Coca Cola.\n\nThis week, Microsoft revealed it entered into a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement with Coca Cola. The Coca-Cola Company  will use Microsoft’s tech expertise to accelerate system-wide AI transformation across its global business and network of independent bottlers.\n\nAI is key to Microsoft’s prospects, which means its cloud business is running the show.\n\nGrowing faster than any other of its businesses, the Azure brings in revenue of tens of billions of dollars every quarter. Together with AI services that go within its package, Cloud is also Microsoft’s biggest tool in its rivalry against Amazon and its Amazon Web Services. But, Amazon and Microsoft are certainly not the only ones battling for the AI throne as this is still just the beginning of that story and a an entirely new era in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk.\n\nThe rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand.\n\n2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024\n\nmichael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of.\n\nFor these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Why Should You Buy Amazon ETFs Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN is set to release first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30, after market close. Being a market leader in e-commerce, it is worth taking a look at the company’s fundamentals ahead of its results (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAmazon has risen 4.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry, which saw a decline of 1.2%. The outperformance is expected to continue, given that the online behemoth has an increased chance of beating estimates in its quarterly report. It saw positive earnings revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nGiven this, investors could tap this opportune moment through ETFs with a substantial allocation to this online behemoth. These include ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS, Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY and VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH.\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our surprise prediction methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny in the past seven days for the first quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate implies massive year-over-year earnings growth of 161.3% and substantial revenue growth of 11.9% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon’s earnings surprise history is impressive, with a surprise of 51.04%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock has a solid VGM Score of A and falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 13%).\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. Of the 46 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 91.3% and 6.52% of all recommendations.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average price target for Amazon comes to $208.86. The forecasts range from a low of $140.00 to a high of $235.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid Growth Prospects\n\nAmazon's growth story hinges on its robust retail business, its strong cloud division, growing investments in generative AI, its solid advertising business and expanding streaming services.\r\n\r\nThe new CEO, Andy Jassy, forecasts that the company will get a boost from strategic cost cuts, cloud-computing demand and the growth of artificial intelligence. In his annual letter to shareholders, Jassy highlighted the tech giant's approach to generative AI, which he described as Amazon's next potential pillar of growth, following its e-commerce marketplace, Prime subscription service and Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business. \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet,\" Jassy wrote.\r\n\r\nAmazon's strategic plans for growth are also highlighted by its possible entry into the grocery sector and its focus on \"primitives\" to drive innovation. In the near future, legal issues could present hurdles but advancements in AI have the potential to transform multiple industries, offering both challenges and prospects (read: 5 ETFs to Tap Amazon's Growth Story).\r\n\r\nGiven the bullishness in AI transformation and the leadership transition to Andy Jassy, Amazon hit a new all-time high in almost three years in the Apr 11 trading session, reflecting a dramatic rebound from its slump in 2022 and the resurgence of confidence in Amazon’s future growth potential. Further, Amazon joined the blue-chip index Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of February, which underscores its strong business growth potential.\r\n\r\nIn its last earnings release, the world's largest online retailer expected revenues to be in the range of $138-$143.5 billion for the first quarter of 2024, implying year-over-year growth of 8%-13%.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)\r\n\r\nProShares Online Retail ETF offers exposure to companies that principally sell online or through other non-store channels and then zeros in on the companies that reshape the retail space. It tracks the ProShares Online Retail Index, holding 18 stocks in its basket. Amazon is the top firm, accounting for 23.9% of the portfolio (read: E-Commerce Boosts U.S. Retail Sales: ETFs to Tap).\r\n\r\nProShares Online Retail ETF has amassed $94.3 million in its asset base and currently trades in a moderate volume of around 16,000 shares a day on average. It charges 58 bps in annual fees from investors.\r\n\r\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS)\r\n\r\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF tracks the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Discretionary Index, holding 285 stocks in its basket. Of these, Amazon takes the top spot with a 23% share.\r\n\r\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF has amassed $1.4 billion in its asset base while trading in a good volume of around 79,000 shares a day on average. It charges 8 bps in annual fees from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.\r\n\r\nVanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR)\r\n\r\nVanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF currently follows the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Discretionary 25/50 Index and holds 304 stocks in its basket. Of these, Amazon occupies the top position, with a 23.1% allocation. Broadline Retail takes the largest share at 25.5%, while automobile manufacturers, restaurants, and home improvement retail round off the next three spots.\r\n\r\nVCR charges investors 10 bps in annual fees, while volume is moderate at nearly 48,000 shares a day. The product has managed about $5.3 billion in its asset base and carries a Zacks ETF Rank #1 with a Medium risk outlook.\r\n\r\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY)\r\n\r\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund offers exposure to the broad consumer discretionary space by tracking the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. It is the largest and most popular product in this space, with AUM of nearly $19 billion and an average daily volume of around 4 million shares. Holding 52 securities in its basket, Amazon takes the top spot with 23.5% of assets. Broadline retail, hotels, restaurants & leisure, specialty retail and automobiles are the top four sectors with double-digit exposure each.\r\n\r\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund charges 9 bps in expense ratio and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 with a Medium risk outlook.\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH)\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Retail ETF provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index, which measures the performance of the companies involved in retail distribution, wholesalers, online, direct mail and TV retailers, multi-line retailers, specialty retailers and food and other staples retailers.

It trades in a lower volume of 6,000 shares a day on average. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What Makes Amazon (AMZN) Attractive Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Seattle-based Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, with a market capitalization of more than $1.8 trillion, is one of the most valuable companies worldwide. Amazon is the frontrunner in the e-commerce and cloud computing space. Jeff Bezos’ company has also ventured into AI to propel its growth and boasts a prospering advertising business.\n\nAMZN shares at first pulled back during the 2020 bear market, but since then, it has gained traction as consumers prefer shopping online. Amazon’s shares scaled upward by 19.1% in the first three months of 2024, exceeding the Internet-Commerce industry’s gain of 10.2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon extended its winning streak and hit an all-time closing high of 189.05 on Apr 11. However, its shares are now trading in a narrow range and have notched gains in two of the last 10 trading sessions since then. So, is there more upside left for this e-commerce behemoth? The consensus among market pundits is that Amazon’s stock will keep gaining in the near term, banking on solid first-quarter earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 30, after market close.\n\nAmazon is projected to report earnings per share of 81 cents in the first quarter of 2024, more than 31 cents a year ago, indicating a jump of 161.3%. Amazon is also estimated to register an 11.9% year-over-year revenue increase, to $142.5 billion.\n\nIn reality, Amazon has already delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 51%, on average, which strengthened investors’ expectations of another round of solid profits and revenues. Moreover, Amazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51%, a tell-tale sign that the company is well-poised to beat in the forthcoming earnings announcement. Needless to say, an improvement in earnings should jack up the share price.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nSustained growth in the advertisement business acts as a boon for Amazon. The company’s advertising revenues soared 24% year over year to $47 billion in 2023. And with the company rolling out video ads in its Prime service in January, ad-related revenues will surely get a boost in the first quarter.\n\nWhat’s more, in a recent survey conducted by Wedbush Securities, almost 56% of respondents said that they increased their ad spending on Amazon by nearly 10% year over year in the first quarter and intend to further increase their budget for Amazon ads by the end of 2024.\n\nRevenues from advertising are widely expected to post a healthy 23% growth by the end of the year and are expected to get a lift from the popular show Fallout, which is one of the most-watched programs on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe generative AI boom across the market, meanwhile, is expected to benefit Amazon’s results not only in the first quarter but all through the year. It is likely to increase demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as the company’s Bedrock AI-platform building tool. Bedrock, which helps in making personalized AI tools, is at present used by umpteen customers, and some notable clients are Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, Pfizer Inc. PFE and Intuit Inc. INTU.\n\nAmazon’s AI push gained momentum after the e-commerce player recently invested $2.75 billion in the AI startup Anthropic known for developing the chatbot Claude. These deals will give Amazon an upper hand against cloud computing rivals Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nAmazon, by the way, has deployed several cost-cutting measures and initiatives to reshape the future of retail business. These encouraging moves will certainly help the company mitigate bottlenecks related to regulatory issues.\n\nTherefore, Amazon in all likelihood is a market darling and its estimated earnings and revenue growth rates for the current year are 42.1% and 11.6%, respectively. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current-year earnings has moved up 1.5% over the past 60 days.\n\nAmazon continues to competently generate profits since it has a return on equity of 16.6%, which is typically considered good. Now, the company may have a low net profit margin of nearly 5.3% but it fares well compared to the industry’s negative margin of 1.3%, an indication that most of its peers’ businesses are unprofitable.\n\nComing to valuation, Amazon’s stock is undeniably pricey. By looking at the Price/Earnings ratio, Amazon presently trades at 43.65 forward earnings. The industry’s forward earnings multiple, on the other hand, is 28.05. However, this means market participants believe that the stock can generate more profits in the future, eventually increasing its demand and price as well.\n\nAmazon, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "A good way to spot trends in the stock market is to look at which companies asset management firms are investing in. While there are a lot of hedge funds out there, one of the more closely followed portfolios hails from Renaissance Technologies.\n\nRenaissance is led by Jim Simons, who is actually a mathematician by trade. A look at the fund's most recent filings shows one clear trend: Renaissance is investing heavily in the technology sector right now.\n\nBut with just about every tech company parroting their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, it can become hard to discern the winners from the wannabes. Let's dig into Renaissance's portfolio and assess the most bullish opportunities from Simons and his team.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the third-largest position in Renaissance's portfolio, and the biggest among its \"Magnificent Seven\" holdings.\n\nWhat I find interesting about Nvidia's prominence in the portfolio compared to other tech stocks is its relationship with Renaissance's largest holding overall: Novo Nordisk. Although Renaissance trimmed its position in the Ozempic maker by 2.4 million shares last quarter, Novo Nordisk is still handily the top position in Simons' portfolio. Following a milestone year in 2023, Novo Nordisk recently teamed up with Nvidia to help accelerate AI in the healthcare world. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow during each quarter of the last 10 years. The obvious takeaway is that the newfound demand fueling AI services has ignited a new growth frontier for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, there's more to the picture here. Nvidia is playing a monumentally important role in the AI revolution. The company's H100 and A100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main engine fueling myriad AI applications, including training generative AI models, enhancing accelerated computing, and more.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are being deployed in Tesla vehicles to help with autonomous driving and are also being leveraged by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to hone its targeted advertising capabilities in an intensely crowded social media landscape.\n\nThe superior pricing power that Nvidia has achieved over the competition has resulted in staggering profit growth. As an investor, what's encouraging to see is that Nvidia is aggressively investing its profits into other high-growth opportunities.\n\nFor example, earlier this year Nvidia joined OpenAI, Intel, and Microsoft in a $675 million funding round for a humanoid robotics start-up called Figure AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think this is a particularly savvy move as Nvidia has a lucrative opportunity to help Figure AI's development from both a hardware and software perspective. In a way, owning Nvidia is similar to owning an index fund focused on several aspects of the AI realm.\n\nNvidia operates across semiconductor chips, robotics, enterprise software, and data center services. The prolific nature of its business is leading to a variety of AI-powered applications, and paving the way for a robust long-term roadmap.\n\nConsidering the enormous opportunities Nvidia orbits, it's not surprising to see the company earn such a high position in a highly regarded portfolio such as Renaissance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms rounds out the top five positions in the Renaissance portfolio. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Renaissance bought a whopping 2 million shares of Meta stock -- an increase of over 2,000% from its prior allocation.\n\n2023 was a transformational year for Meta, and I'm not surprised to see smart money pouring into the stock.\n\nLast year, Meta underwent several rounds of layoffs in an effort to reduce its expense profile -- which briefly became bloated following some hefty investments related to the metaverse in 2022. Moreover, the company doubled down on its core advertising business and proved that it can fend off rising competition from the likes of Alphabet and TikTok.\n\nThe table below illustrates some important operating metrics for Meta:\n\nMetric 2022 2023 Change Revenue $116.6 billion $134.9 billion 16% Operating income $28.9 billion $46.7 billion 62% Free cash flow $18.4 billion $43.0 billion 134%\n\nData source: Meta.\n\nMeta's return to respectable top-line growth combined with disciplined cost controls ultimately led to soaring profitability. The company demonstrated a true sign of maturity by announcing that it will be reinvesting these profits in the form of a dividend and an increased share repurchase program.\n\nConsidering Meta's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.5 is currently the second lowest among the Magnificent Seven, I think the stock looks especially attractive as sales and profits look to be back on the right track.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nThe last company I'll be exploring is Renaissance's sixth-largest holding, e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nI see Amazon in a similar light to that of Nvidia. While the company is largely known for its online store, Amazon is a far more prolific business. The company is a leader in cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and it also operates in the worlds of streaming and advertising.\n\nThe trends below hit on an important theme for Amazon investors. AMZN Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLingering inflation and high borrowing costs took a toll on Amazon's business over the last couple of years. However, 2023 was somewhat of a rebound year as Amazon sharply turned back to a consistently cash-flow-positive business. And just like Nvidia, Amazon is deploying this cash to ignite new growth.\n\nBack in September, Amazon committed to a $4 billion investment in AI start-up Anthropic. The overarching thesis of the deal was to integrate Anthropic into AWS to help unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nMoreover, AI has the potential to span across Amazon's entire ecosystem. For example, the technology can help Amazon discover cost efficiencies that it can integrate into warehouse and fulfillment centers, as well as new marketing tactics that it can employ for both the e-commerce and advertising segments.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 is essentially identical to its 10-year average, making it a compelling buy for long-term investors.\n\nI think Simons is onto something with his specific Magnificent Seven allocations, and I see each of the companies discussed above as solid opportunities for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 3 Internet-Commerce Stocks Poised to Beat on Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "We are in the middle of the first-quarter 2024 earnings season, which has turned out better-than-expected so far. A few Internet-commerce companies are slated to report their quarter quarterly financial numbers this week. A handful of these stocks carries a favorable Zacks Rank.\n\nOnline Retail Sales in Q1 at a Glance\n\nInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it progress. On the one hand are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other hand, there are sophisticated, AI-enabled software platforms facilitating transactions more capable of delivering user satisfaction.\n\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc., as well as more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players.\n\nOnline retail sales were weak in January and February due to soft holiday sales in the 2023-24 season. However, online sales picked up in March climbing 2.7% month over month and 11.3% year over year.\n\nWithin the Retail sector, the Zacks-defined Internet-Commerce industry is currently in the top 13% of the Zacks Industry Rank. In the past year, the industry has provided 52.7% returns. Year to date, it has advanced 11.3%. Since the industry is ranked in the top half of Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect the e-commerce industry to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to three e-commerce stocks that are poised to beat on first-quarter earnings results this week. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our three picks in the last quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has benefited from the Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an Earnings ESP of +7.51%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 51%. The company is set to release earnings results on Apr 30, after the closing bell.\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. BKNG has been benefiting from strength in the overall travel demand environment, particularly in global leisure travel. This, in turn, has lowered cancellation rates. Strong momentum across merchants as well as advertising and other businesses, boosted BKNG’s top-line growth.\n\nStrong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is another positive. Strength across room nights and gross bookings, owing to BKNG’s favorable demand environment, bolstered its results. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities were major positives.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Booking Holdings has an Earnings ESP of +4.13%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nBooking Holdings recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 13.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on May 2, after the closing bell.\n\nWayfair Inc. W is benefiting from growing momentum across active customers, owing to lower costs and increasing customer and supplier loyalties. Growing merchandising efforts are contributing well to W’s top-line growth. Strengthening market share, driven by broad availability and fast delivery of products, is a tailwind.\n\nIncreasing operational efficiency, driven by lower personnel and information technology costs, is a major positive. Growing momentum across U.K. customers, owing to W’s strength in logistics, is driving growth. Additionally, W’s strong momentum across repeat customers is a plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Wayfair has an Earnings ESP of +60.20%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nWayfair recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 71.9%.

        "title": "Paycom (PAYC) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Paycom Software PAYC is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 1.\n\nThe company projects revenues between $494 million and $497 million for the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $495.9 million, indicating an increase of 9.8% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.43 per share, suggesting a 1.2% decline from the prior-year quarter.\n\nPaycom estimates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $218-$222 million in the quarter to be reported.\n\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.9%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nPaycom Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPaycom Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nPaycom’s first-quarter results are likely to have benefited from the robust demand for its latest offerings, the addition of new logos and high-margin recurring revenues. Our estimate for the company’s recurring revenues is pegged at $488.4 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 9.9%.\n\nPAYC’s employee usage strategy, efforts on sales and investments might have contributed to sales growth in the first quarter of 2024. Furthermore, the company earlier announced its plans to strengthen its advertising and marketing efforts to generate more demo leads and virtual meetings, and ensure growth in sales close rates. These factors are likely to have contributed to the market share gains for Paycom.\n\nThe company expects the strong adoption of its Beti solution. Notably, Beti enables employees to manage all their payroll requirements, including timecards, benefits, expenses and vacation requests. The solution helps employees rectify forms before submission. This solution reduces hassles and saves time for its users. New client additions to Beti’s present user-base are expected to have driven the top line in the first quarter.\n\nNevertheless, PAYC’s quarterly results are expected to have been affected by macroeconomic challenges and business disruptions caused by uncertainties developed by global conflicts. Moreover, enterprises are postponing their large IT expenditures due to the softening global economy caused by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. These factors might have hurt the headcount across its customer base in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Paycom this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nStory continues\n\nPaycom has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Arista Networks ANET, Docebo DCBO and Amazon.com AMZN have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nArista Networks has an Earnings ESP of +2.49% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of Arista Networks have gained 12.4% year to date. ANET is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 7.\n\nDocebo has an Earnings ESP of +8.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nShares of Docebo have lost 7.6% year to date. DCBO is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 9.\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nShares of Amazon have jumped 18.2% year to date.

        "title": "Apple and Amazon Earnings: Tech Stocks to Buy for Breakouts and Long-Term Upside",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks breaks down the recent market comeback during the wave of tech sector earnings results from Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla, and more. The episode then shifts its focus to two of the biggest companies in the world—Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN)—before they report to explore why investors might want to buy these mega cap tech stocks for possible near-term breakouts and long-term upside.\n\nThe bulls stepped up right at the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq’s 21-week moving averages. The comeback came after both major indexes fell to their most oversold levels since the market bottomed in October.\n\nThe market then looked poised to chop around a bit more after divergent reactions to Meta and Tesla. Then Alphabet (GOOGL) surged on Friday following its report to help the Nasdaq inch closer to its 50-day moving average. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet followed Meta’s lead earlier this year and declared its first-ever dividend, highlighting big tech’s commitment to profits and returning value to shareholders in our new interest rate environment. It also touted its ongoing AI efforts and growth outlook.\n\nThe two stocks we dive into today are prime examples of companies that could send the market higher in the near term. Even if Apple and Amazon fail to break out after earnings, both stocks appear to be worthy long-term investments.\n\nApple (AAPL) – Earnings on Thursday, May 2\n\nApple shares have fallen almost 15% from their records. Worse yet, AAPL has climbed just 1% in the last 12 months, lagging the Zacks Tech sector’s 37% run, Alphabet’s 60%, and Microsoft’s (MSFT) 35%. Wall Street worries about Apple’s slowing growth in China and its lack of blockbuster AI expansion. On top of that, the DOJ is suing Apple for what it views as the iPhone’s monopoly over the U.S. smartphone market.\n\nDespite the fears, Apple has doubled the tech sector over the last five years and outperformed GOOGL and MSFT, up 230%. AAPL appears to be finding support at its long-term 21-month moving average while trading at historically oversold RSI levels.\n\nApple stock trades 20% below its average Zacks price target heading into its upcoming earnings release and at a 26% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.8X forward 12-month earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple is a cash cow that buys back a ton of stock and pays dividends. Apple is exploring new growth avenues such as AI and beyond to deploy its $65 billion of net cash. Tim Cook’s company also remains committed to reaching net cash-neutral over time. Apple is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 7% in FY24 and 9% in FY25, with flat sales in 2024 and 5% expansion next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has more than doubled its paid subscriptions over the last four years across its services ecosystem to well over 1 billion, helping cash in on its over 2.2 billion active devices. It might be time for investors to consider buying Apple during its disappointing stretch to take advantage of the tried-and-true mantra of being greedy when others are fearful.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Earnings on Tuesday, April 30\n\nAmazon shares soared 63% in the last 12 months and 115% off their lows. AMZN slipped from its recent all-time highs and trades 20% below its average Zacks price target. Amazon stock has climbed over 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech’s 281% and Alphabet’s 550%. Amazon could be ready to break out of a trading range (see nearby chart) if it wows Wall Street this week.\n\nOn the valuation front, Amazon trades 90% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median. The rapidly improving earnings multiple is driven by Amazon’s commitment to streamlining operations at every turn to churn out profits. The company is also rapidly expanding its AI efforts and its cloud computing business stands to profit from the AI super cycle no matter what. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon is the largest cloud computing company and the biggest e-commerce player. Plus, its digital advertising business is booming and it is committed to boosting its streaming efforts. Amazon is projected to post 12% revenue growth in FY24 and FY25 and expand its bottom line by 42% and 31%, respectively. AMZN’s EPS outlook soared after its Q4 release to extend an impressive stretch of upward revisions that lands it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Buying (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, numerous next-big-thing investment trends have come and gone. But none of these trends have offered to change the growth arc for corporate America quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves using software and systems to undertake tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What makes AI special is the ability for software and systems to become smarter without human intervention over time (i.e., machine learning). Being able to evolve over time and become more proficient at their tasks gives AI-driven software and systems utility across almost every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to a report released last year by the analysts at PwC, productivity gains and consumption-side effects directly tied to AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. A figure this large is hard for investors -- and members of Congress -- to ignore.\n\nBased on data compiled by Unusual Whales in its \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report, members of Congress can't stop buying four artificial intelligence stocks. Interestingly, you won't find Nvidia on this list, despite it being a favorite of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband!\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first AI stock lawmakers have been avid buyers of is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, among other ventures.\n\nMembers of the House and Senate purchased an aggregate of $1.49 million worth of Alphabet Class A stock (GOOGL) last year. The biggest buyers included House. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who made numerous purchases in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, as well as House Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-NY), who added between $50,000 and $100,000 of Alphabet stock in late January 2023, based on trading activity compiled by Capitol Trades.\n\nWhat makes Alphabet such an attractive investment is its world-leading search engine. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search share. As the clear choice for advertisers, Google tends to enjoy strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates. Lengthy periods of economic growth are positive for ad-driven companies, as well.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest growth driver looks to be Google Cloud. Alphabet has been busy incorporating generative AI solutions into Google Cloud to help merchants tailor ads to consumers.\n\nLast year marked the first time Google Cloud generated a full-year operating profit. With enterprise cloud spending still early in its ramp, and cloud margins running circles around advertising margins, Alphabet should see a healthy uptick in its operating cash flow over time.\n\nStory continues Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband have been active buyers of Apple stock. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nApple\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that members of Congress have pounced on is tech titan Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). With the exception of oil and gas company ConocoPhillips, no stock was purchased more in 2023 by lawmakers than Apple ($2.4 million).\n\nThough Apple's future isn't as reliant on AI as the other companies on this list, voice assistant Siri is an example of it incorporating AI solutions into its iPhone for more than a decade.\n\nApple's biggest buyer in Congress last year was none other than S&P 500-outperformer Nancy Pelosi. A periodic transaction report from the former House Speaker noted a $500,000 to $1 million buy of Apple stock in March, which was followed by the purchase of $250,000 to $500,000 in additional shares in June.\n\nInnovation continues to be the driving force behind Apple's long-term outperformance. Its iPhone controls more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady evolution of Apple into a platforms company. Focusing on subscription services should lift the company's operating margin over time, as well as smooth out the revenue ebbs-and-flows that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since the start of 2013, the company's board has overseen $651 billion in buybacks.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third AI stock that congressional traders can't stop buying is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Unusual Whales' report finds that $1.06 million in Amazon shares were purchased by lawmakers last year.\n\nThe big buyers of Amazon stock have been the aforementioned Michael McCaul and House Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA). McCaul and Khanna are the two most-active traders in Congress, with 1,826 trades and 4,253 trades, respectively, completed last year.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its top-notch online marketplace, which accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. retail sales last year. However, operating margins associated with e-commerce are rather low. When it comes to cash flow generation and long-term growth potential, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's shining star.\n\nAWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 31% of global share, as of September 30, 2023, per Canalys. With enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, AWS shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate and generating the bulk of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon is also aggressively deploying generative AI solutions within AWS to allow its customers to build applications that can better serve their consumers.\n\nTesla\n\nA fourth AI stock that members of Congress can't stop buying is none other than North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Between the House and Senate, $840,000 in Tesla stock was purchased by lawmakers in 2023, according to Unusual Whales.\n\nThe congressional \"whale\" that was busy mashing the buy button on Tesla is Daniel Goldman. Though Goldman was active as both a seller and buyer -- behind Khanna and McCaul, he's the third most-active trader in Congress, with 1,306 trades in 2023 – his purchases of $100,000 to $250,000 of Tesla stock on March 6, 2023, as well as $15,000 to $50,000 on February 3, March 1, and April 10, stand out.\n\nThe lure for lawmakers with Tesla is its first-mover advantages in the EV space. Tesla has successfully built itself from the ground up to mass-production and delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla's EVs use cameras and sensors to assist with the split-second decision-making needed to navigate obstacles.\n\nBut among the four stocks congressional traders can't stop buying, Tesla is at the greatest risk of tumbling. Weakening demand for EVs has coerced Tesla to slash the price on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. The company has also dramatically reduced the price of its full-self driving software from what was once $15,000 to $8,000. Despite these substantial price reduction, Tesla's operating margin has nosedived from 17.2% to 5.5% over the last six quarters and its inventory levels have practically doubled.\n\nTesla's attempts to become more than a car company have fallen flat, too. Its Services segment offers a low-to-mid single-digit gross margin, while revenue growth for its once red-hot Energy Generation and Storage segment has slowed to the single digits. The once-vaunted growth story for Tesla looks to be officially dead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The AI trade is back, as confidence in Big Tech surges",
        "content": "The AI craze has returned to Wall Street — and investors are buying in.\n\nStandout quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) put the AI narrative back on track, sparking renewed confidence that big tech’s expensive bets on AI is boosting growth.\n\nAlphabet shares soared to an all-time high on Friday, closing above $2 trillion in market cap for the first time. Microsoft shares ended up 1.8%.\n\n“The AI investment story is intact,” BMO Wealth Management U.S. chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOutperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year.\n\n“They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.”\n\nResults from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago.\n\n“The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.”\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize.\n\nAnd the AI opportunity goes far beyond Microsoft and Google — the two companies often viewed by Wall Street as leaders in the AI race.\n\nRBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson told Yahoo Finance that Meta’s (META) selloff following earnings was an “overreaction,” and believes AI will be a “transformational driver\" for the company.\n\n“We’d be buying it,” Erickson said.\n\nThe rally in Mag 7 stocks comes ahead of key results from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) this week — two earnings reports that will be another critical test for the tech trade amid sky-high valuations.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "One Third of Billionaire David Tepper's Portfolio Is Made Up of These 3 Magnificent Seven Stocks",
        "content": "Before becoming the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers and MLS's Charlotte FC, David Tepper made his name (and money) through Appaloosa Management, a global hedge fund he founded. Tepper, whose net worth is around $20 billion, is one of the top 100 richest people in the world. Needless to say, he's had success in the investing world.\n\nGiven Tepper's success, it makes sense that investors would look to his and his hedge fund's investments to gain tips. While the average investor and billionaire hedge fund managers don't have the same risk tolerance or investment goals, there's nothing wrong with looking to them for inspiration.\n\nTepper's portfolio is fairly concentrated, with almost a third being held in three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. If investors want solid businesses with long-term sustainability, they need look no further.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) became a household name because of its e-commerce business, but it has since branched out and become a major player in a handful of industries.\n\nFor a while, Amazon's e-commerce business was unprofitable and used mainly as a revenue generator. It's still Amazon's biggest revenue source, but it has recently become profitable. In the fourth quarter, Amazon's North American segment made around $6.5 billion in operating profits, an impressive turnaround from the $240 million it lost in Q4 2022. Its international segment lost $419 million, which isn't ideal, but it still leaves Amazon profitable in its non-Amazon Web Services (AWS) businesses. AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThere's still room for growth in e-commerce, but much of Amazon's growth will rely on its cloud service, AWS. Although AWS growth slowed recently, 13% year-over-year (YOY) growth isn't too shabby for Amazon's biggest profit-maker. AWS has a commanding market share in global cloud services but has lost a little ground over the past year. Still, its market share is 31%, which leads Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure (a 24% share) and Alphabet's Google Cloud (11%).\n\nIn the long term, Amazon stands to benefit from the organic growth of cloud services and e-commerce. However, the company has also shown that it's willing to make investments in new industries. Take its $13.7 billion Whole Foods purchase and healthcare ambitions, for example. Investors can count on the company not getting complacent.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nThere are diverse tech businesses, and then there's Microsoft, the poster child for casting a wide net of businesses.\n\nMicrosoft didn't become the world's most valuable public company by accident; it's taken years of impressive business growth and a boost from AI mania. The latter may also carry the company through its next phases of growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's strategic partnership with OpenAI -- which gives it exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) -- could be exactly what it needs to further strengthen its hold on office software. From Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) to Azure to Teams, Microsoft is almost unavoidable in the corporate world.\n\nMicrosoft's abundance of corporate clients gives it an edge in ensuring its longevity and shielding against economic and market downturns. When times get hard, consumers can easily forego the newest smartphones or online shopping, and businesses can cut back on their advertising. It's much harder for companies to stop using Office software, migrate their data off the cloud, or jump ship from established communication platforms like Teams.\n\nWith Microsoft, investors can be confident they're investing in a company built for sustained growth over the long haul.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nFacebook creator Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) continues to be one of the premier cash cow businesses, earning around $36.5 billion in revenue in Q1, up 27% YOY.\n\nAveraging 3.24 billion family daily active people in March 2024 (up 7% YOY), Facebook shows why it continues to be a go-to for many of the top advertisers globally. Meta has capitalized on this, increasing its family average revenue per person from $9.47 in Q1 2023 to $11.20 in Q1 2024.\n\nDespite the growth in key metrics, Meta's stock plummeted after releasing its latest earnings, dropping as much as 15% on the same day. Much of this is because of the company's spending plan going forward, which mostly surrounds its AI infrastructure. Meta said it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion this year, up from the prior $30 billion to $37 billion estimate. META Capital Expenditures (Annual) Chart\n\nInvestors may not agree with the spending plan, but their reaction seems overreactive. The good news, though, is that its lower valuation makes it a more compelling entry point.\n\nInvestors should also appreciate Meta's new dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend yield isn't enough to please most income-seeking investors, but it's an incentive that can encourage investors' patience as Meta works on its AI plans.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "My 3 Favorite Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Many investors have a list of stocks they are keeping their eye on. Some might be stocks already in the portfolio that could be added to, and others could be stocks to keep an eye on as future portfolio additions. Keeping track of potential stock buys can help investors make more informed decisions, and keep an eye on any important news.\n\nHere are three stocks that I think are a buy right now, and that should be on any investor's list of potential investments. Each has strong historical results and a bright future. Let's dig in to see what has these companies at the top of my list.\n\nCostco\n\nIf you've ever had the experience of navigating a crowded Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) parking lot just to get into the store, you've experienced why the company has grown to be the third-largest retailer in the world. Costco's membership fee business model was unique when it began, but it has been a driver of the company's results for decades. In the last 12 months, Costco brought in nearly $5 billion in membership fees.\n\nCostco has also proven to be resilient to slowing economic conditions. While we may not be in a recession, inflation has led to people pulling back on spending, if only a little. To the extent that's the case, Costco has not felt it. In its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February, Costco reported same-store sales growth of 5.6% and an increase of 5.3% in traffic. Costco's value proposition is clear to its members, who renew at a rate of over 90%.\n\nAmazon\n\nFor those not paying attention to Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock over the past few years, it may come as a surprise that in 2022 it traded for its lowest price since early 2019. This was due to substantial operating losses in its e-commerce business because of the spending on its distribution footprint necessary to meet pandemic-fueled demand. Over the past year, the improvement has been impressive.\n\nIn fourth-quarter 2022, Amazon reported an operating loss of $240 million in its North America segment (which is essentially the e-commerce business in North America) and an operating loss of $2.2 billion in its International segment (which is essentially the e-commerce business outside of North America). In Q4 2023, these improved to an operating income of $6.6 billion in North America and an operating loss of $419 million in the International segment.\n\nThese figures are a result of a concerted effort to rightsize the business coming out of the pandemic's height. This improvement in operating results led to net income improving by more than $10 billion and free cash flow increasing by nearly $50 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang\n\nIf you read about Korean e-commerce giant Coupang(NYSE: CPNG), you'd be forgiven for assuming you were reading about Amazon instead. Taking a play directly out of the Amazon playbook, Coupang has grown to be a formidable player for e-commerce on the Korean peninsula and has recently expanded abroad, most notably into Taiwan.\n\nIn Q4 2023, Coupang reported that its active customers grew 16% year over year to 21 million. Much like Amazon's Prime offering, Coupang has a membership program called Rocket WOW that includes free shipping, free returns, and dawn and same-day delivery. Growth in WOW members was 27% in Q4, outpacing overall membership growth and demonstrating the popularity and value proposition of the Rocket WOW program.\n\nCoupang is also starting to see economies of scale as it grows. In Q4 2023, operating income was $473 million, a substantial improvement from the $112 million operating loss posted in Q4 2022. Free cash flow followed a similar trajectory, growing by approximately $2 billion year over year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Investing in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) five years ago would have delivered you a 83% gain",
        "content": "Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders have enjoyed a 83% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 66% (not including dividends).\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Amazon.com moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Amazon.com has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 70% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on Amazon.com it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "A Fed meeting, jobs report, and more Big Tech earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks rebounded as tech earnings spawned a rally in markets despite growing concerns that the Fed will hold interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 4% last week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped almost 3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose less than 1%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Fed meeting, the April jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will test the recent optimism in markets.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nCompanies reporting earnings include AMD (AMD), Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), McDonald's (MCD), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Starbucks (SBUX), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nAn update from the Fed\n\nThe latest decision on interest rate policy from the Federal Open Market Committee is expected on Wednesday, followed by a media press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Markets widely expect the central bank will hold rates steady.\n\nInvestors will be closely listening for how the Fed is interpreting recent hotter-than-expected inflation data given that the market has scaled back its rate cut expectations.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\n\"Another round of elevated inflation data is likely to lead to a more hawkish-leaning message at the May FOMC meeting,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a research note on Friday. \"While we expect the Committee will maintain an easing bias, we also anticipate the statement and press conference will echo Chair Powell’s view that firmer inflation prints suggest it will take longer to gain confidence about disinflation.\"\n\nSince Powell said publicly on April 16 that inflation was taking \"longer than expected\" to fall to the Fed's 2% target, data on price increases has come in above expectations. Most recently, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.8% over the prior year in March, above estimates for 2.7% and unchanged from the annual increase seen in February.\n\nAfter the print, investors were pricing in just a 33% chance that the Fed cuts rates in July, down from an 83% chance a month ago, per the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nWith the Fed committed to holding rates higher until it feels confident inflation is coming down, there is a continued focus on the health of the labor market. Resilient data has economists hopeful inflation can fall to 2% without the economy slipping into recession despite a higher interest rate environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe April jobs report is expected to show 250,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In March, the US economy added 303,000 jobs while the unemployment rate slipped to 3.8%.\n\nAnd, largely, economists don't expect there to be any signs of cracks in the strong labor market story.\n\n\"We don't expect the recent momentum in the labor market to slow,\" BofA US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday.\n\nBig Tech earnings roll on\n\nThe market's reaction to Big Tech earnings has been a mixed bag thus far. Meta's (META) plans to spend heavily on artificial intelligence, along with its softer-than-expected second quarter revenue guidance, gave investors pause. The social media giant's stock fell more than 10% following its earnings release.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) proved to be the winner of the week: Its stock popped more than 10% after the company announced a cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, approval for a $70 billion share repurchase program, and earnings results that topped estimates. The company's market cap topped $2 trillion on Friday.\n\nBaird technology desk sector strategist Ted Mortonson reasoned that a large reason behind the divergent moves in the two Big Tech stocks was a \"game of positioning.\" Meta stock had soared over the past year, while Alphabet didn't outperform by nearly as much.\n\nThis narrative will be put to the test once again in the week ahead when Apple and Amazon are scheduled to report earnings. Apple enters its report with shares down more than 11% this year amid growing concerns over a slowdown in demand. Meanwhile, Amazon is up more than 18% this year and hovering near an all-time high.\n\nEarnings scorecard\n\nBeyond Big Tech, this week will wrap up the two busiest weeks of reporting for the S&P 500. With 46% of the index having already reported for the quarter, the index is tracking for earnings per share growth of 3.5%, slightly above the 3.2% expected prior to the start of earnings season, per FactSet.\n\nAt large, companies that beat on earnings per share and revenue are seeing muted positivestock reactions, while companies that miss are seeing more negative stock performance than usual.\n\nStrategists have told Yahoo Finance it seems companies are struggling to impress investors and drive big stock reactions after a massive market rally to start the year.\n\n\"You don't just need a beat [on earnings and revenue estimates] and hold [on guidance], you need a beat and raise and confidence in the very long-term trajectory of these companies,\" Citi strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStill, there has been a silver lining in earnings reports thus far: Profit margins are increasing. The S&P 500 is pacing for a net profit margin of 11.5% this quarter, above the 11.2% seen last quarter and in line with where margins were a year ago.\n\nAs Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner noted in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook back in January, a key question for investors in 2024 has been whether or not corporates will be able to preserve margins amid sticky inflation and high interest rates. For now, the answer appears to be yes.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEarnings: Avis Budget Group (CAR), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Logitech (LOGI), Paramount (PARA), Philips (PHG), SoFi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nEconomic news: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, April (-11.3 expected, -14.4 prior)\n\nTuesday\n\nEarnings: Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), McDonald's (MCD), Oatly (OTLY), Pinterest (PINS), PayPal (PYPL), Riot Platform (RIOT), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Sirus XM (SIRI), Starbucks (SBUX), 3M (MMM)\n\nEconomic news: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, April (104.1 expected, 104.7 previously); Employment cost index, first quarter (+1% expected, +0.9% prior); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, February (+0.1% expected, +0.14% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, February (+6.59% previously)\n\nWednesday\n\nEarnings: Carvana (CVNA), CVS (CVS), Devon Energy (DVN), Estée Lauder (EL), Etsy (ETSY), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Marriott International (MAR), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Paycom (PAYC), Pfizer (PFE), Qualcomm (QCOM), Wing Stop (WING)\n\nEconomic news: JOLTS job openings, March (8.72 million expected, 8.76million last month); S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI, April final (49.9 expected, 49.9 previously); ISM Manufacturing, April (50.1expected, 50.3 previously); ISM prices paid, April (55.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, Mach (+0.3% expected, -0.3% previously): Federal Open Market Committee rate decision (no change expected)\n\nThursday\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Coinbase (COIN), Cigna(CI), ConocoPhillips (COP), DraftKings (DKNG), Expedia (EXPE), Moderna (MRNA), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Peloton (PTON), Wayfair (W)\n\nEconomic news: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, April (+0.7% previously) Unit labor costs, first quarter (+2% expected, +0.4% previously); Nonfarm productivity, first quarter (+1.5%% expected, +3.2% previously); Weekly initial jobless claims (217,00 previously); Factory orders, March (+1.6% expected, +1.4% previously); Durable goods orders, March final (2.6% previously)\n\nFriday\n\nEarnings: fuboTV (FUBO), Hershey (HSY)\n\nEconomic news: Nonfarm payrolls, April (+250,000 expected, +303,000 previously); Unemployment Rate, April (3.8% expected, 3.8% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, April (+4% expected, +4.1% previously); Average weekly hours worked, April (34.4 expected, 34.4 previously); Labor force participation rate, April (62.7% previously) S&P Global US Services PMI, April final (50.9 expected, 50.9 previously); ISM Services PMI, April (52 expected, 51.4 previously)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The future of the U.S. economy holds promise despite recent fluctuations. After a robust rebound from the pandemic recession, unemployment remains low, wages are increasing, and families and businesses continue to spend confidently. This sustained economic activity and ongoing investments suggest resilience in facing challenges like inflation. While rising prices may pose hurdles, they also reflect increased consumer demand and economic vitality. As Americans adapt their spending habits in response to changing circumstances, such as adjusting dining out frequency or opting for more cost-effective grocery choices, they demonstrate flexibility that can contribute to long-term stability. Overall, the economy’s underlying strengths, including solid employment levels and consumer optimism, point towards a positive trajectory for sustained growth and recovery for these top growth stocks in the coming months.\n\nThe economy is in a turbulent period, so now is the perfect time to invest in top growth stocks.

Its valuation jumped 39% YTD and has a 12-month median price target of $131, an increase of 17%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe global semiconductor market, an extensive and competitive industry, is projected to grow from $573.44 billion to $1,380.79 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 12.20% over seven years. As the industry evolves, Micron can leverage its vital position to expand its share of this lucrative market.\n\nFinancially, MU reported remarkable performance that beat expectations and offered upbeat guidance. The company saw revenue jump to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in Q2 2023. Furthermore, MU brought in an astonishing $793 million in net income and reported adjusted EPS of $0.42, significantly higher than last year.\n\nThe most significant catalyst behind Micron’s success comes from its substantial government funding. Recently, the chipmaker announced an agreement under the 2022 Chips Act, including $6.1 billion in grants and up to $7.5 billion in loans from the Commerce Department. This funding will be used to build two new manufacturing plants in Clay, New York and one in Boise, Idaho. The Boise plant is expected to start production in 2026, while the New York plants will be finished in 2028 and 2029. As Micron expands its manufacturing footprint in the U.S., expect revenue and profit to skyrocket.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen.

It has created and licensed Windows and the Office Suite of web applications, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, etc.\n\nMSFT has seen rapidly increasing profit and revenue, with YOY quarterly revenue growth of 33%. This revenue is expected to proliferate due to rising EPS estimates and demand for cloud computing solutions. Due to this, analysts predict an average growth potential of 8.26%. A profit margin of 36% with an FCF of $58.68 billion shows this leading company’s strong financials.\n\nThe AI/ML sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, reaching $2.03 trillion by 2030. Such a drastic increase in annual growth for this sector has led to a corresponding increase in the demand for solid cloud computing solutions. This is one of Microsoft’s strong suits. Additionally, adopting AI in Microsoft Office Suite will likely increase consumer demand. This paints a bright future for Microsoft’s short, medium and extended growth.\n\nIn conclusion, broader market trends and Microsoft’s strategic positioning position this stock for rapid growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) A photo of Amazon's (AMZN) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ioan Panaite / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become an internet-based business enterprise primarily providing e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) services. AMZN’s current stock of $179.79 grew 71% in the past year.\n\nThe Global Consumer Discretionary Sector’s analysts are optimistic about this industry. They expect annual earnings growth of 34% over the next five years. Companies in this industry have grown revenues by 9.6% per year.\n\nAMZN had such historical growth in Q4 2023. It’s revenue of $169.96 billion grew 13.91% YOY, beating the analysts’ expectations by 2.23%. AMZN also reported a net income of $10.62 billion and diluted EPS of $1.01. They grew 3721.58% and 3189.47% YOY, respectively. Its net income especially beat the analysts’ expectations by 24.44%. Overall, Q4 2023 was a success for AMZN.\n\nAmazon recently announced that it would invest $11 billion in Indiana to build data centers and employ 26,000 full- and part-time staff. This may not seem like bringing Amazon that much dramatic change, but big technology companies nowadays, such as OpenAI’s viral ChatGPT, have been racing over the past year.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Finding compelling growth stocks isn't a terribly difficult task in the modern market environment. They're often staring you right in the face.\n\nShopping for growth stocks you can buy and hold forever, however, is a different story. Their underlying companies should be industry leaders capable of adapting as needed. And the industries they're in should be ones that will always be in demand. Just ask Kodak, Blockbuster, and Tower Records.\n\nHere's a rundown of three growth picks you can feel good about buying now and sitting on indefinitely.\n\n1. Ulta Beauty\n\nTo be fair, Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans made a valid observation when downgradingUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) to a hold recently. The beauty retailer truly is facing a \"lack of newness and increasing pressure from Sephora\" at this time.\n\nThere are a couple of matters the downgrade looks right past, however.\n\nThe first of these is that while the beauty business (skincare, haircare, cosmetics, fragrance, etc.) may be highly competitive, it's also a business that perpetually lends itself to new brands and products. Although Ulta's recent additions of Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro brands aren't making a significant impact -- at least not yet -- remixing its product lineup is nothing new to Ulta. Patience will pay.\n\nAnd the other overlooked factor working in Ulta Beauty's favor? While its recent earnings reports have been ho-hum and revenue guidance for the remainder of the current fiscal year is lackluster, that isn't an indictment of the company. It's a symptom of the current economic environment. Spending on must-have consumer staples is up due to inflation, putting pressure on discretionary spending including on beauty goods. The recent Wall Street Journal headline (specifically regarding Ulta) \"Beauty Slowdown Reflects Cracks in Consumer Spending\" speaks volumes.\n\nAll economic headwinds are cyclical, though. The economy will work its way back to full health sooner or later, and likely sooner than later. Once that happens, look for discretionary spending on things like makeup and haircare to bounce back with it.\n\nThe kicker: Ulta Beauty's operation meets consumers increasingly where they want to be. That's not so much the mall anymore. Rather, it's their neighborhood, and online in particular. Younger, digitally native consumers care less about where they buy their goods. They care far more about value and convenience, allowing Ulta to leverage its surprisingly strong e-commerce operation and membership/rewards program. In this vein, member utilization of its shopping app was up 30% last quarter. The retailer's also making investments in tech that will better personalize the online shopping experience, which should ultimately drive more member purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's just going to take some time for all of this to come together.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become such a frequently suggested stock pick that it's almost become cliché. Amazon is of course one of the planet's biggest e-commerce platforms (and certainly the biggest in the western half of the world). Yet, it still only controls a little more than one-third of the United States' e-commerce market, and even less outside of the U.S. It's also a huge cloud computing service provider. Synergy Research Group reports Amazon's share of the cloud computing leads the way at 31% of the industry's worldwide revenue.\n\nConnect the dots. There's still plenty of room ahead for growth.\n\nThe reason Amazon is a true forever name, however, are the evolutions it's going through right now.\n\nA rethinking of how to best monetize online shopping is one of these evolutions. In its infancy the company's core business was simply selling goods online. Then it got serious about third-party sellers. Now it's turning up the heat on its retail media business, charging sellers to prominently feature their goods at Amazon.com. This may be Amazon's most lucrative, highest-margin business yet, which was worth $47 billion last year alone.\n\nAnother bigger-picture evolution is an effort to improve the appeal of cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services.\n\nWhile it may be the world's single busiest cloud services company, Amazon Web Services' lack of recent revenue growth is stark. Would-be cloud customers are finding providers like Microsoft and Alphabet are better equipped to meet their needs, particularly as it pertains to artificial intelligence.\n\nAmazon is upping its game, though. Just this week the company unveiled several new features for its generative AI platform called Bedrock. And, earlier this year the company acquired a data center directly connected to a nuclear power plant, recognizing the amount of electricity needed to support artificial intelligence platforms is so enormous that it could prove restrictive.\n\nSome of these initiatives will pay off sooner than others. All of them underscore the sort of long-term holistic thinking Amazon is doing.\n\n3. Nike\n\nLast but not least, add Nike(NYSE: NKE) to your list of growth stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nIt's been a tough past couple of years for Nike. Although the company's decision to rely less on retail partners and focus more on home-grown revenue makes sense, the shift isn't proving easy. As it turns out, struggling athletic apparel and footwear store chains like Foot Locker are still go-to destinations for consumers.\n\nAt the same time, the powerhouse sports apparel brand is learning just how tough it is to scale up your own direct-selling operation with or without an online presence. Last quarter's overall revenue was flat year over year, while Nike's digital sales -- a frequent bright spot in the company's recent quarterly reports -- only improved a modest 4% during the three-month stretch ending in February.\n\nThen there's the simple fact that younger consumers are more willing to try out new brands, like On Holdings.\n\nEnd result? Revenue growth for Nike has been hit-and-miss. Ditto for earnings. That's the big reason Nike stock is down by nearly half of its late-2021 peak price.\n\nThere's a detail too many investors are forgetting here, though. Recent challenges aside, this is Nike. It remains the world's single-biggest and best-known athletic wear brand, and it downright dominates the athletic footwear arena with a market share of 62%, according to numbers from IBISWorld. Nike might be on the defensive now, but it's got plenty of tools and name recognition to work with.\n\nThere's plenty of reason to expect such a turnaround of sorts in the near future, too.\n\nAt the same time he acknowledged last month that the company pushed too aggressively to wean itself from retail partners, CEO John Donahoe added that Nike hasn't been innovating enough of late. Perhaps feeling a little added pressure from shareholders and during board meetings, Donahoe may be about to light a fresh fire under the company's business starting with this coming summer's Olympics. It's a high-profile catalyst to be sure.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best home appliance stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to the 5 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSince ancient times, humans have continuously advanced their domestic equipment, from the earliest use of fire for cooking to modern innovations. As we have advanced within the modern age, comfort and convenience have emerged at the forefront of our endeavors. To that end, as long as people inhabit homes, there will be a persistent and increasing demand for home appliances. The market offers a wide range of products, from compact coffee makers to spacious refrigerators capable of storing large amounts of food. While stoves and electric cookware were among the first home appliances introduced in the early 1900s, the market has since expanded significantly in terms of availability and variety. As a result, it's hardly surprising that home appliance companies rank among the largest globally, with industry leaders like Samsung and Panasonic emerging as modern-day giants. Falling within the broader consumer discretionary sector, the global home appliances market was valued at $708.15 billion in 2023. Projections indicate further growth, with the market expected to reach $1,203.11 billion by 2032, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.20% during the forecast period.\n\nOverall, stock prices of consumer discretionary companies typically fluctuate in line with the broader economy, classifying them as cyclical stocks. The most notable example in recent years came in the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed significant challenges not only for the home appliance sub-sector but also for the broader consumer discretionary sector. However, with the economy gradually reopening, investors now have a distinct opportunity within this sector. Jordan Michaels, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, anticipates sustained robust performance from the consumer discretionary sector this year. Notably, the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index closed 2023 with a notable total return of 42.41%, marking one of its strongest years to date. Apart from benefiting from a resilient consumer base, stocks within this sector capitalized on broader market trends that propelled the overall market upwards in 2023.\n\nSee also: 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nHoming in on the home appliance market specifically, the sector is witnessing significant growth in the realm of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly successful are robots that automate simple chores like vacuuming or lawn mowing. Additionally, there's a growing market for companion robots for children and innovative projects like Tesla's assistant robot. This emergence of \"smart\" home appliances has sparked significant growth in this segment. According to a report by KBV Research, smart home appliances are projected to grow at a robust CAGR of 8.7% until 2028, reaching a value of $50 billion by the end of the forecast period. These appliances offer users a range of features, including remote control via smartphones, self-learning capabilities to adapt to user schedules, and improved energy management. Generative AI also plays a pivotal role in driving innovation, such as GE Appliances' SmartHQ app, which enhances appliance intelligence and personalization using large language models similar to those powering tools like ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe promises these combinations hold are staggering, with many company execs arguing that it could put them on par or even ahead of their biggest competitors. For example, South Korean tech giant Samsung has strived to rival U.S. Big Tech Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the realm of high-end smartphones and cutting-edge electronics for years. However, Han Jong-hee, vice chairman and head of Samsung’s Device eXperience (DX) division, asserts that with artificial intelligence (AI) technology at their disposal, Samsung stands on equal footing with, or even ahead of, its primary competitor. According to the Samsung home appliance chief, the company's brand image among consumers ranks among the world’s finest, with the company having maintained top ratings in TV sales for 18 consecutive years, and its Galaxy line of smartphones fiercely competing with Apple’s iPhones.\n\nIn light of this, this article focuses on some of the top-performing home appliance stocks currently available in the market. Among the notable picks are Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR). 11 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest in\n\nCopyright: johnkasawa / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the following home appliance stocks based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (NYSE:HBB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 8\n\nHamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (NYSE:HBB) is an American firm based in Glen Allen, Virginia, renowned for designing and distributing small household and specialty appliances globally. Its diverse product line includes food processors, electric grills, coffee makers, and toaster ovens.\n\nAs of the end of Q4 2023, Insider Monkey's database indicated that 8 hedge funds maintained stakes in Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (NYSE:HBB), up from 6 in the previous quarter.

We highlighted HBB in previous communications as supply chain woes pressured its balance sheet and market capitalization. Third quarter earnings continued trends established in the second quarter as HBB generated robust cash flow and strengthened its balance sheet. Investors were impressed, prompting a 42% rise in HBB’s shares in the fourth quarter. We are particularly proud of HBB’s operational rebound as the investment required plenty of attention over the past two years given the dour outlook in the post-Covid economy. Fund Management maintained conviction in the fundamentals, which prompted us to boost the position weighting at opportune times, and ultimately generated healthy returns for our shareholders.”\n\nMuch like Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.

As part of that process, the company recently divested its Hardware and Home Improvement segment, selling it to the Swedish conglomerate Assa Abloy for $4.3 billion in cash. We owned Spectrum when this divestiture was originally announced but exited our position when the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued to block the sale. That action threatened to derail SPB’s efforts to improve its balance sheet and shed a highly discretionary segment that was noncore to the company’s strategy.\n\nWe recently got clarity on this overhang, when the DOJ reached a settlement with Assa Abloy, allowing the sale to go through. This gives SPB ample capacity to repurchase shares at a steep discount to intrinsic value while setting the stage for operational improvements. Meanwhile, the stock trades at just 7X next year’s EBITDA and 5X to 5.5X normalized EBITDA.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBill Miller’s Latest 13 Stock Picks 10 Best Weight Loss Drug Stocks to Buy Now Cathie Wood’s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 Top Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in This Bull Market",
        "content": "Since bottoming out in 2022, the S&P 500 index has rocketed to new highs. While no one knows how long this run will last, history shows bull markets tend to last for longer stretches than when the market falls.\n\nOf course, Warren Buffett isn't fazed by these ups and downs. He focuses on investments in solid companies that he believes will grow in value over many years.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio is full of outstanding businesses. Three Fool.com contributors recently selected their favorite stocks from Berkshire's holdings. Here's why they believe Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Lennar(NYSE: LEN), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are solid buys right now.\n\nOne of the strongest brands in the world\n\nJohn Ballard (Apple): Apple stock has underperformed so far in 2024. Investors appear concerned about slowing iPhone sales in China and regulatory headwinds. But none of these obstacles impact Apple's ability to deliver growth and reward shareholders over the long term.\n\nApple was still Berkshire Hathaway's largest investment at the end of 2023, with a stake worth $174 billion. Buffett said a year ago that Apple was a better business than any Berkshire owned -- a significant statement, considering the incredible returns Berkshire has delivered over the years.\n\nThe dip is a good buying opportunity ahead of a potentially strong growth period for Apple. The company is reportedly spending up to $1 billion per year on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. It is widely speculated that Apple may release new AI features for its iOS software as early as this year.\n\nOver the next decade, AI could be game-changing for the customer experience, including potential implementation in AppleCare and Apple's productivity apps like Pages and Numbers.\n\nApple has all the cash it needs to continue improving its products. The company generated $107 billion in free cash flow over the last year, and it will keep growing as it sells more devices around the world.\n\nApple's installed base of active devices continues to hit new highs, now over 2.2 billion. While market participants focus on weak iPhone sales in China, Apple is still on the move everywhere else.\n\nThis homebuilder still looks promising\n\nJeremy Bowman (Lennar): Berkshire Hathaway surprised investors last year by going long on homebuilder stocks. Buffett (through Berkshire) purchased D.R. Horton, NVR, and Lennar. The conglomerate has since sold D.R. Horton, the country's largest homebuilder, but it still retains small positions in Lennar and NVR.\n\nWhile both of those stocks are worth buying, Lennar is cheaper than NVR and is more similar to D.R. Horton, which just reported a strong quarterly earnings report, showing that demand for new homes remains strong, and profits continue to flow into the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe won't get another quarterly update from Lennar until June, but the company looks to be in a good position to benefit from the same trends, including elevated interest trades, a lack of inventory in existing homes, and an estimated housing shortage of 4 million due to restrictive zoning laws and years of chronic underbuilding. Those factors have all contributed to elevated home prices, which is also a boon for homebuilders like Lennar.\n\nIn its first-quarter earnings report, Lennar reported 12.6% revenue growth, which drove earnings up 21% to $719 million, and earnings per share rose 25% to $2.57 as management has taken advantage of the low stock price to buy back stock. Over the last year, the company has reduced shares outstanding by about 3.5%.\n\nLennar also reported growth in all four of its regions, showing broad-based demand and execution. New orders increased 28% to 18,176 homes, showing healthy and growing demand.\n\nWith interest rates now expected to remain \"higher for longer,\" Lennar is in a good position to capitalize on the housing crunch and macro environment, and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.\n\nLennar looks like a good bet to move higher as it capitalizes on the demand for new homes.\n\nBuffett's bet was late, but still profitable\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Buffett isn't known for buying technology stocks, and he acknowledged that he was late to the game when Berkshire finally invested in Amazon in 2019, 20 years after it became a public company.\n\nAmazon had already minted millionaires, but that didn't deter Buffett from buying at that point. Buffett is all about patient investing, and he preferred to buy Amazon once it had a proven track record and strong profits while still offering tremendous opportunities.\n\nBuffett didn't buy Amazon for exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), and he probably wouldn't buy stocks today just to benefit from emerging trends. That might be part of the lesson in Buffett's investing approach: When you buy stock in great companies, you'll end up winning from these kinds of future opportunities, which Amazon has in abundance.\n\nAmazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, but its growth story still looks incredibly compelling. It's the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. by a wide margin, and e-commerce is growing faster than overall retail. It has made structural changes to its e-commerce infrastructure that speed up deliveries at lower costs, and that should enhance its dominant position as well as pad profitability.\n\nAmazon is also the leading cloud services provider, and its AI tools for code developers and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients reinforce its lead against a growing cadre of competitors. Amazon is investing in this groundbreaking technology, and it has a long, open runway in this growth story.\n\nDigital advertising has become Amazon's fastest-growing segment, and this high-margin business is another lever it's pushing to increase sales. Its AI tools for advertisers, as well as the ability for advertisers to reach customers as they shop, make Amazon a no-brainer platform for ads.\n\nGrowth stocks tend to perform well in bull markets, and Amazon is already up 75% over the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors have been snookered by technology head fakes in the past. The metaverse was hardly the game-changing advance we were promised. Very few people, it turns out, actually want to be connected to their computers all day, every day to work, play and interact. The metaverse may hold some value but the exponential market opportunity analysts predicted seems way off the mark.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is different. Today, businesses are realizing tangible real-world benefits of utilizing AI. Speed bumps will emerge along the way, of course. Energy consumption is going to strain just how far the technology can go. Water for cooling systems will divert an already scarce resource from other equally vital needs. But unlike the metaverse, AI is the real deal.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the early stages of AI’s breakout. Its advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) chips were readily able to handle the complex and all-consuming nature of AI’s demands. But with more competition developing equally powerful chips, Nvidia stock may not be the winning play it once was.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three companies are AI stocks to outshine Nvidia in the next stage of the technology’s evolution and growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough best known as a smartphone chipmaker, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) flies under the radar of many investors as an AI stock. They might be surprised to learn Broadcom is actually the second-largest AI chipmaker by revenue behind Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker generated $4 billion in annual AI revenue last year but reported $2.3 billion in the first quarter, quadruple the year-ago figure. It estimates 35% of fiscal 2024 revenue will come from AI, or some $10 billion. Previously the chipmaker forecast a quarter of its revenue, or $8 billion, would be from AI but growth is accelerating.\n\nThe reason for the increase is data center demand from hyperscalers. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators are behind the designs of the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Also, it designed a custom chip for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At its investor day in March, Broadcom announced it signed on a third large cloud customer for its AI accelerators.\n\nLook for the chipmaker to readily surpass Nvidia in the near future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another surprising AI chipmaker that is on a path to outshine Nvidia. The chipmaker is looking for AI revenue to double this year and then keep doubling for several years thereafter. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a customer, and earlier this month announced it won another large customer for its AI chips. The one downside for Marvell Technology is that its custom chips carry lower gross margins than its off-the-shelf chip business.\n\nYet, custom chips will be a significant driver of future revenue growth. And Marvell Technology is looking to make up in volume what it loses in margins. For that reason, the chipmaker maintained its gross margin forecast when it reported earnings recently. Marvell says adjusted gross margins will be between 62% and 63% in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nWhere the chipmaker is expected to excel is in the electro-optical chips that sell into data centers and AI networks. With both channels anticipated to see significant expansion in the coming years, Marvell Technology will experience rapid growth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock that should outshine Nvidia in the future is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay, just about every chipmaker turns to TSM to make its chips – Nvidia included.\n\nWhen the chipmaker reported earnings the other day, it shook the market by implying a slowdown coming in the semiconductor market. However, it forecast its own business to keep growing with guidance of “low- to mid-20%” revenue growth. AI was the primary reason for it.\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei said the contract manufacturer was still experiencing a “surge in AI-related demand.” He termed it “insatiable.” It is yet another semiconductor stock expecting AI to cause revenue to “more than double this year.” TSM forecasts AI will represent a “low-teens” percentage of full-year sales.\n\nWith Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as top customers, so long as their respective AI business grows, you can be sure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will outshine them all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Want $1 Million in Retirement? 3 Stocks to Buy Now And Hold for Decades.",
        "content": "In some ways, investing is like baking. With baking, you mix ingredients and pour them into a pan, put the pan in the oven, and wait. If you do those things the right way, you should have something tasty. Similarly, if you invest in the right mixture of stocks and wait long enough to allow them to grow, you can end up with a sizable portfolio.\n\nIn both baking and investing, the quality of your outcome depends heavily on the ingredients you use and an adequate amount of time. Want $1 million in retirement? Here are three stocks to buy now and hold for decades.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nTwo qualities make it much more likely a stock will be a big winner over the long run. First, it should have a strong moat. Second, it should have optionality (multiple ways to grow). Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has both qualities in spades.\n\nArguably the biggest moat for Amazon is its network effect: The more customers and vendors use its e-commerce platform, the more valuable its platform becomes. However, that isn't Amazon's only moat. Its brand is a gold mine all by itself. Amazon enjoys economies of scale throughout its operations. And there are significant switching costs for customers using its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.\n\nThe company is so big now that it isn't likely to deliver the same level of growth over the next few decades that it has in the past. But Amazon should still generate exceptional long-term returns thanks to its multiple growth avenues.\n\nThere's still plenty of room for Amazon's online shopping business to expand, with e-commerce making up only 15.4% of total U.S. retail sales last year. AWS' growth prospects remain impressive as companies deploy artificial intelligence (AI) apps in the cloud. Don't underestimate Amazon's ability to move into new markets, either.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) has quite a bit in common with Amazon. Its e-commerce platform also has a strong moat. So does the company's fintech business. Arguably the most compelling reason to buy the stock, though, is its focus on the Latin American market.\n\nThe combined gross domestic product (GDP) of countries in the region totals over $5 trillion. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is lower than in the U.S. And, as MercadoLibre correctly stated in a recent investor presentation, \"[F]inancial services are ripe for disruption.\"\n\nMercadoLibre is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in Latin America. It operates the region's largest e-commerce platform, with a 28% compound annual growth rate in gross merchandise volume since 2016. The company's logistics network is the broadest in the Latin American market. Its fintech business is the market leader in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, and the second-largest in Brazil based on monthly active users.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, MercadoLibre has a booming advertising business. It currently ranks No. 3 in digital advertising market share in Latin America.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) is already a big biopharmaceutical company, with a market cap of nearly $104 billion. I predict it will grow much larger over the next decade and beyond.\n\nThe drugmaker has achieved tremendous success with its cystic fibrosis (CF) therapies. However, Vertex's best CF treatment yet could be waiting in the wings: The company plans to file for regulatory approvals of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo in mid-2024.\n\nVertex has already won regulatory approvals in the U.S. and the U.K. for its likely next blockbuster -- Casgevy. This gene-editing therapy provides a functional cure for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.\n\nI'm most excited, though, about the rest of Vertex's pipeline. The biotech expects to soon file for U.S. approval of the non-opioid pain drug suzetrigine (VX-548). It recently advanced inaxaplin into late-stage testing in treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which could present a bigger market opportunity than CF. And Vertex is moving forward with clinical studies for therapies that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Plug Power Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Plug Power(NASDAQ: PLUG), a developer of hydrogen fuel cell systems, was one of the biggest boom and bust stories of the dot-com bubble more than two decades ago. The company went public at a reverse split-adjusted price of $150 per share on Oct. 29, 1999, and its stock soared nearly tenfold to its record high of $1,498 on Mar. 10, 2000.\n\nBut today, Plug's stock trades at about $2 a share. A $10,000 investment in its IPO would only be worth $160 today. It briefly surged to the mid-60s during the buying frenzy in meme stocks in early 2021, but those gains evaporated for three reasons. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFirst, Plug Power's growth slowed down as it racked up steep losses. Second, the company failed to file its annual report for 2020 on time, and it subsequently admitted that it would need to restate all of its financials for 2018 and 2019. At the same time, it was hit by a series of class action lawsuits alleging it repeatedly misled its investors. Lastly, Plug Power simply wasn't generating enough revenue to support its skyrocketing valuations.\n\nPlug Power still faces a murky future, but its stock looks cheap at less than two times this year's sales. Some 27% of its shares were still being shorted as of April 15, and its insiders actually bought more shares than they sold over the past three months. So could its beaten-down stock stage a major comeback over the next three years?\n\nWhat happened over the past three years?\n\nPlug Power's GenDrive is a hydrogen fuel cell system for electric forklifts, automated guided vehicles, and ground support equipment. Its GenSure platform is a stationary hydrogen grid solution for telecom, data center, transportation, and utility customers. It also sells electrolyzer systems for building modular hydrogen generators, liquefaction systems for producing liquid hydrogen, pre-produced liquid hydrogen, and cryogenic equipment for storing and transporting liquid hydrogen.\n\nPlug Power has deployed over 69,000 fuel cell systems for forklifts and over 250 fueling stations so far. Its largest customers include Walmart(NYSE: WMT), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which have all been testing out hydrogen-powered forklifts in their warehouses and fulfillment centers.\n\nPlug Power's revenue rose 27% to $891 million in 2023, but that represented a deceleration from its 40% growth in 2022. Meanwhile, its operating margins shriveled as its net losses widened at an alarming rate.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $502 million $701 million $891 million Operating Margin (87%) (97%) (151%) Net Income (Loss) ($460 million) ($724 million) ($1.37 billion)\n\nData source: Plug Power.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its fourth-quarter conference call in March, CFO Paul Middleton blamed that slowdown on the \"chaos in the hydrogen fuel market,\" which caused an \"unprecedented number of industry fuel facility shutdowns\" throughout the year. Middleton also admitted that it was taking \"longer than planned\" for Plug to scale up its own hydrogen plants.\n\nThat's a grim situation for a company that ended 2023 with $635 million in current liabilities and just $135 million in cash and equivalents. It will likely try to raise more cash through secondary offerings, but it's already nearly tripled its share count over the past five years with its previous offerings and stock-based compensation.\n\nWhat could happen over the next three years?\n\nPlug Power believes it can gradually narrow its losses by raising its prices, shrinking its workforce, consolidating its facilities, and streamlining its business processes. It expects those efforts will throttle its near-term revenue growth, but it also believes those improvements will boost its cash flow to positive levels this year. Here's what analysts believe will happen to Plug's business over the next three years.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 2026 Revenue $990 million $1.53 billion $2.06 billion Operating Margin (70%) (21%) (2%) Net Income (Loss) ($719 million) ($394 million) ($249 million)\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimates. Data source: Marketscreener.\n\nWe should be skeptical of those rosy estimates, especially considering how many times Plug Power disappointed its investors over the past two decades. However, the company is still one of the earliest movers in the U.S. hydrogen fuel cell market, which Precedence Research expects to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nIf Plug matches analysts' sales expectations in 2026 and still trades at about two times that number, its stock could easily double or triple from its current levels. If it successfully scales up its business and narrows its losses at a faster rate, it could command a higher valuation and generate even bigger multibagger gains over the next three years.\n\nI'm not saying that will happen, but Plug seems to have more upside potential than downside potential at these prices. Nevertheless, investors should see if it successfully narrows its losses over the next few quarters before nibbling on its stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Plug Power wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 best Carfax alternatives to check vehicle history. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Carfax Alternatives to Check Vehicle History.\n\nCarfax VS AutoCheck: A Comparative Analysis\n\nVehicle history reports are essential when purchasing used cars. These reports use the vehicle identification number (VIN) to extract the event history of a car, highlighting any major accidents or repairs it might have undergone in the past. Carfax and AutoCheck are two renowned platforms that provide essential background information for a car.\n\nCarfax is part of S&P Global Inc.'s (NYSE:SPGI) S&P Global Mobility division and is a leading American company that sells used cars. The company is known for its vehicle history reports, listings, maintenance, and advice. The vehicle history service by Carfax includes accident history, ownership history, title history, mileage information, recall information, and service and maintenance details. A vehicle history report by Carfax costs $44.99 for a single report, $64.99 for three reports, and $99.99 for 5 reports. On April 22, Carfax announced that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) had approved Carfax car listings as an In Market Retail (IRM) Turnkey product. The collaboration brings a pool of more than 25 million browsing customers for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) dealers. Moreover, consumers would be able to select new, used, or certified pre-owned General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) cars and would also be able to check their history through Carfax vehicle history reports.\n\nOn the other hand, AutoCheck is part of Experian PLC (OTCMKTS:EXPGY). The company works on a model similar to Carfax and provides vehicle history reports. A vehicle history report at AutoCheck costs around $24.99, whereas the cost of 5 reports is $49.99.

        "title": "20 Countries with the Highest Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET)",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at 20 countries with the highest share of youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET). If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the economic cost of youth unemployment, you can go to 5 Countries with the Highest Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET).\n\nThe Concept of NEETs and its Development Relevance\n\nIn 2020, the ILO reported that globally, 22.4% of individuals aged 15 to 24 could be identified as NEETs. Within this category, 67.5% were women. NEETs refer to young individuals not in education, employment, or training, generally aged 15 to 29. However, some countries may vary the age groups in their operational definitions, depending on the average age to finish school. The goal behind calculating NEETs is to capture the ‘untapped’ potential of the youth, as stated by the World Bank. It consists of unemployed youth who are actively seeking work, as well as those who are unemployed but not actively looking for work.\n\nThe latter category may have reasons such as limited labor mobility, discrimination, or other societal barriers. They might also view the available job opportunities as limited. Additionally, people may be involuntarily out of work due to family responsibilities, health issues, or disabilities. According to the World Bank, those who are a part of the NEET population are at a severe risk of labor market and social exclusion because they are neither investing in their skills nor gaining experience through employment. In addition to the youth unemployment rate, the NEET rate helps add essential context to the economic conditions of the youth within a particular country, as it also includes youth who may be economically inactive due to discouragement.\n\nThe Economic Cost of NEETs\n\nWhile being a NEET has economic consequences for the individual’s life, it also has broader effects on the wider economy. In 2022, the OECD reported that the NEET rate for 20-24-year-old individuals in the United Kingdom was 12.47%, whereas in Germany, it was 8.88%. PwC analyzed the OECD data on NEET rates for their Youth Employment Index 2022. Their study found that if the UK managed to reduce its NEET rate to German levels, the economy could potentially see a GDP boost of £38 billion. Another study published in January 2024, conducted by Mariem Liouaeddine, evaluated the economic cost of NEETs in Morocco. The researcher concluded that in 2019, the total cost of young NEETs to Moroccan public finance was around 60 billion Moroccan Dirhams, equivalent to almost $6 billion today. According to a report by  Morocco World News, the country had a NEET rate of 28.5% in 2021. You can also look at 17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe COVID-19 Impact\n\nIn 2022, the ILO published a report on the youth NEETs in the Asia-Pacific region. Before COVID-19, the area had 155 million NEETs in the age bracket of 15 to 24. Between 2010 and 2019, the average youth NEET rate in the region was 23.6%, but there was significant variation between the sub-regions. For example, South Asia had the highest rate at 29.2%, and the Pacific Islands had the lowest at 16.2%. Out of the total NEETs, 72% were women. However, the situation worsened when the COVID-19 crisis struck. The pandemic pushed an additional 9.5 million youth into NEET status, bringing the total NEET count in the region to 165 million. Of these 9.5 million individuals, 7.5 million were young men. However, women still made up 69% of the total NEET count.\n\nFurthermore, 7 million of the total were South Asian, but overall, all regions in the Asia-Pacific saw an increase in NEET numbers. Most of the new NEETs were inactive individuals who stopped actively looking for jobs as the labor market began worsening due to the lockdowns. You can also view the 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\nNEETs Vs. Hikikomori\n\nIn 2018, O'Reilly et al. published a book covering the origins of the concept of NEETs in European policymaking. According to the author’s research, the idea originated in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and was formally adopted by the European Commission Employment Committee in 2010 with an agreed-upon definition and methodology. However, as the idea spread to other developed countries in the 1990s, the indicator changed to attach a level of negative stigma. In Japan, the term ‘Hikikomori’ refers to young NEETs, often men, who live with their parents and spend all their time in isolation without engaging with other people or friends. The term itself means ‘withdrawal,’ referring to those living in complete social exclusion. Similar terms were also seen in Italy (Bamboccioni) and Germany (Nesthocker).\n\nAccording to a CNN report from April 7, 2023, nearly 1.46 million individuals in Japan can be identified as Hikikomori. However, the difference in the calculation of this value is that it considers all individuals aged 15 to 64 rather than just being limited to the youth. One of the reasons behind that is Japan’s booming elderly population and declining birthrate. The term ‘8050’ problem refers to Hikikomori individuals in their 50s who rely on their parents in the 80s. The problem has risen enough that in 2018, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare established a Hikikomori support body to improve living conditions for these individuals.\n\nSouth Korea is another country experiencing a similar effect. A BBC report from May 27, 2023, reported that between the ages of 19 and 39, 340,000 people could be identified as Hikikomori. This makes up around 3% of this age group. In order to bring these people out of their homes, the government is now offering monthly stipends. Young individuals between the ages of 9 and 24 can receive up to $490 a month (650,000 won), as well as subsidies for services such as health, legal services, cultural activities, and counseling. Through this policy, the government hopes these individuals can leave their homes and reintegrate into society. While not all NEETs fall into the Hikikomori category, almost all Hikikomori can be classified as NEETs as they do not participate in any economic activities.\n\nCorporate Support\n\nIn order to aid the youth NEETs, private sector companies can provide massive support by offering training and employment opportunities specifically geared towards such individuals. In particular, ed-tech companies play a considerable role in skill building. A significant example of this is Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR). The online platform offers courses from over 350 universities and companies, aimed at building all kinds of hard and soft skills. In its 2023 Learner Outcomes Report, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) reported that 77% of learners mentioned learning from Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) helps their careers.\n\nFurthermore, one in four people who completed an Entry-Level Professional Certificate were able to get a job. In developing countries, 91% of low-income learners reported career benefits of learning through the platform. The learning also offered personal benefits, with 62% of learners feeling more confident and 50% feeling they now had more growth opportunities. 30% of unemployed learners were employed after completing their most recent program or course on the platform. The survey covered over 55,000 learners from 190 countries.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another company providing skills training to unemployed individuals. In October 2021, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont announced a partnership with AWS, Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud services business. Under this venture, AWS collaborated with the Connecticut Office of Workforce Strategy and Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) to train unemployed individuals in cloud computing. The partnership is expected to offer technical skills training to 2,000 Connecticut residents by 2024. Since then, all CSCU colleges and universities have provided courses and certificates that help students acquire these skills.\n\nPreviously, the AWS Academy by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has showcased success in a similar program implemented by Staffordshire University in the UK. In 2019, the University partnered with AWS to provide six courses in cloud computing. In 2022, AWS reported that 93% of course participants were able to find employment within six months of graduating. You can also look at 25 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the World.\n\nOfferings by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) can help young individuals upskill themselves while also improving their career prospects. These courses can be highly convenient because many can be acquired remotely. In this context, here are 20 countries with the highest share of youth not in education, employment, or training, where the youth may benefit from such services. 20 Countries with the Highest Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET)\n\n20 Countries with the Highest Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET)\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we have reviewed the ILO dataset on the proportion of youth (15-24 years) not in education, employment, or training. The countries are organized in ascending order of the percentage of youth NEETs. Further information for the countries has been sourced from the World Bank and ILO.

The company’s position at the forefront of this trend bodes well for investors, as demand for AI and machine learning applications continues to disrupt industries. The company also recently teamed up with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to further integrate cloud-based automation. However, the main inflection point previously discussed is the company declaring its first quarterly profit as a publicly traded company in Q4 FY24. CEO Rob Enslin doesn’t expect growth to slow down anytime soon, and the future of the RPA market remains extremely promising.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to have continued gaining from the solid momentum in the rapidly growing cloud market on the back of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nWe note that the growing popularity and the strong adoption of AWS have been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business. The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS’s revenues were $24.2 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, accounting for 14% of net sales, rising 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base, owing to a robust AWS portfolio, is likely to have driven AWS’s top line in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 AWS net sales is pegged at $24.26 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to find out how the company’s overall first-quarter performance is expected to have been.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nThe company’s expanding AWS portfolio is expected to have benefited the first-quarter performance of the underlined segment. Growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities are likely to have been other positives.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, AWS extended its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology via the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.\r\n\r\nAWS’s partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage remains noteworthy. As part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nExpanding portfolio offerings are expected to have driven AWS’s customer momentum in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nDeutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) extended its multi-year partnership with AWS to drive innovation across Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2. As part of this, AWS has become the official generative AI provider for DFL and has been the official technology provider for the latter.\r\n\r\nNTT DOCOMO also selected AWS, and intends to leverage the latter’s robust infrastructure and cloud services to deploy its nationwide 5G Open Radio Access Network in Japan.\r\n\r\nOwkin selected AWS as the primary cloud provider. Owkin intends to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials with the help of AWS’s scalable storage options, enhanced data security measures and strong computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nA strong customer base is expected to have continued to help Amazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), to boost its competitive position in the cloud computing market against Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, which have been making concerted efforts to bolster their cloud market share.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. Azure's globally increasing number of availability zones and regions, along with strength in Azure AI and growing generative AI capabilities, remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions, and solid momentum in generative AI have been positives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Price and EPS Surprise DoorDash, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nDoorDash, Inc. price-eps-surprise | DoorDash, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement:\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nDoorDash’s first quarter 2024 performance is expected to have benefited from strong total orders and Marketplace GOV, alongside enhanced logistics efficiency and an increasing contribution from advertising.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter of 2024, DoorDash anticipates Marketplace GOV in the range of $18.5-$18.9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Marketplace GOV is pegged at $18.80 billion, suggesting 18.18% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nDoorDash’s expanding partner network, namely Eataly, El Super and Fiesta Mart, to broaden the reach of on-demand grocery delivery across multiple regions is expected to have boosted total orders growth in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, total orders increased 23% year over year to $574 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total orders stands at $606 million, suggesting 18.3% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nDoorDash’s growing efforts to expand its grocery offerings, improve user experience and increase DashPass adoption and the retention of customers are expected to have boosted growth in the grocery category in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing investments across new business verticals such as convenience, retail and DashMarts are expected to have been tailwinds for the company.\r\n\r\nIncreasing monthly active users with strong contributions from domestic and international markets is expected to have aided DASH’s top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, DoorDash is facing extensive competition in the largest category of its business, which is a headwind.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Top Amazon.com Inc. executives including founder Jeff Bezos and Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy destroyed text messages discussing business, the Federal Trade Commission alleged, erasing evidence the agency could have used in its antitrust case against the retail giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Fed’s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Billionaire Stephen Ross Believes in South Florida—and Is Spending Big to Transform It Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nBetween April 2019 and May 2022, Bezos, Jassy and others communicated using the encrypted communications platform Signal, the FTC said Thursday in a court filing, and used a feature so that messages weren’t retained. Other executives who communicated via Signal, according to the FTC, include David Zapolsky, Amazon’s top lawyer; Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s retail czar until 2021; and Dave Clark, a longtime logistics executive who left in 2022 after Bezos handed the reins to Jassy.\n\nThe FTC’s court filing expands on allegations the agency first made in its antitrust complaint last fall against the company.\n\n“The FTC’s contentions are baseless,” said company spokesman Tim Doyle. “Amazon voluntarily disclosed employees’ limited Signal use to the FTC years ago, thoroughly collected Signal conversations from its employees’ phones, and allowed agency staff to inspect those conversations even when they had nothing to do with the FTC’s investigation.”\n\nExecutives used the encrypted communications app after Bezos disclosed in 2019 that his phone had been hacked and alleged the National Enquirer tabloid sought to publish his intimate photos and texts.\n\nThe court filing seeks information about what Amazon executives conveyed to employees about when to communicate via Signal and its instructions on retaining messages.\n\nThe FTC needs the information “to assess whether Amazon failed to take reasonable steps to preserve documents and to map out what information has been destroyed,” according to the agency’s filing.\n\nThe investigation into Amazon opened by the agency in 2019 required the company to retain and turn over documents. By using Signal’s disappearing messages function, executives interfered with the FTC’s ability to investigate Amazon’s business conduct and potential antitrust violations, the agency said.\n\n“The FTC has a complete picture of Amazon’s decision-making in this case including 1.7 million documents from sources like email, internal messaging applications, and laptops (among other sources), and over 100 terabytes of data,” Doyle said.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS antitrust enforcers have also accused Alphabet Inc.’s Google of destroying evidence by failing to retain internal communications despite multiple investigations into the company that required them to preserve documents. The Justice Department alleged that Google encouraged employees to have sensitive conversations over chat with the history function turned off, meaning the conversation would be automatically deleted after 24 hours.\n\nA California federal judge found Google “adopted a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy for chat preservation” and reprimanded the company’s top lawyer over the data preservation protocol.\n\nThe Justice Department has sought sanctions against the company over the issue, though a different federal judge has yet to rule on the request.\n\nThe FTC could refer any wrongdoing it uncovers to the Justice Department if it discovers anyone deliberately destroyed evidence.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day and Spencer Soper.\n\n(Updates with excerpt from court filing in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nEarnings season is in full swing, and investors have some high expectations for some of the mega-caps reporting next week such as Amazon and Apple. In the UK, investors should still keep a focus on Anglo American as the bid rejection from BHP is unlikely to be the last move by the Australian miner.\n\nIn Europe, the continent's most valuable company Novo Nordisk will show if it still reigns supreme.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Reports on Tuesday 30 April\n\nAhead of the company’s quarterly results, several analysts have been reaffirming their bullish views on the stock.\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter financial results after the US market close on 30 April. The company is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTotal net sales of $142.59bn are predicted, up from $127.36bn a year ago.\n\nWedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note that ads on Prime Video could generate about \"$6.5bn of incremental revenue\" once it is fully in place across the world.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his shareholder letter earlier this month that he thinks artificial intelligence could be the \"largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nAmazon’s market cap nearly reached $2tn for the first time in April and even after a slight pull back, the shares are still up by nearly a fifth in 2024 and by two-thirds over the past year (to rank it third among the Magnificent Seven, behind Nvidia [NVDA] and Meta [META]).\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon and Anglo American\n\n“One of the reasons behind this stunning run is Amazon has re-established its powerful earnings momentum, which was briefly lost in late 2021 and early 2022, as fears of a recession gathered, inflation and interest rates rose, and oil prices increased input costs,” according to investment director Russ Mould, head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and investment analyst Dan Coatsworth, all of AJ Bell.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Another is the perception that Amazon is a winner in the race to lead, and monetise, the development of generative AI, thanks in particular to its cloud-service business AWS [Amazon Web Services] which makes far more money than the US and International retail arms and is the real heart of the business now. That said, North America roared back in 2023 to also record its highest-ever quarterly and annual operating profit, buoyed by free-spending US consumers,” they added.\n\nApple (AAPL) – Reports on Thursday 2 May\n\nApple, one of the most important names in the stock market, but the iPhone maker’s performance as been anything but stellar.\n\nThe stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among mega cap technology companies.\n\nThe consensus estimate for sales is $89.8bn, down 5.3% year-on-year (compared to the 2.1% year-on-year increase in Q1). In the unlikely event Apple gives any steer for Q3, analysts are looking for $82.7bn, up 1.0% year-on-year, according to AJ Bell.\n\nFor share earnings per share, or EPS, analysts are looking for $1.50 for net income of around $2bn, down a fraction from $1.52 a year ago. In Q3, analysts are looking for $1.31, marginally higher than in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAnalysts are split over the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts expecting the iPhone maker will slightly top the consensus estimates.\n\nBank of America (BofA) also seems bullish, recommending the company given its “rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows”, according to BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.\n\nMorningstar is wary of iPhone sales that have been hit by a sales slump in China.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as traders digest US tech earnings and Bank of Japan decision\n\n“We anticipate a weak quarter for iPhone sales, which Apple has guided Wall Street to expect. This should spur a poorer overall quarter for the firm, as the iPhone remains its primary driver.\n\n“We expect another quarter of strong profitability for Apple helping offset weaker sales growth. Apple benefits from a higher mix of its services business and more consumers opting for premium options like the iPhone Pro models,” Morningstar wrote.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, “will likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus’ 2% drop”.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nNot reporting but set to keep making markets move in the UK as in these mega deals the first bid rejection is just the start of negotiations to find the right price.\n\nBritish mining giant Anglo American has rejected a £31.1bn takeover offer by Australian rival BHP (BHP.L).\n\nThe FTSE 100 miner said the bid was “opportunistic” and “significantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects”. Strong words but not enough to stop BHP, according to analysts.\n\n“There’s every chance BHP will come back to the table,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nBHP said in a statement Thursday that it valued Anglo American shares at £25.08 ($31.40) apiece, or £31.1bn ($38.9bn) in total.\n\n“It’s no surprise that Anglo American has rejected BHP’s takeover bid. Anglo American has long seen itself as one of the big players in the market and it certainly won’t let a rival swoop on the business when its chips are down,” AJ Bell’s Mould said.\n\nRead more: Barclays profits slip amid mortgage squeeze\n\n“The usual playbook for mega deals in the resources space is for the original suitor to respond to rejection by coming back with a better offer, or someone else throwing their hat into the ring. That contender could be Rio Tinto (RIO.L) as it will certainly be watching activities with keen interest given it can see the same opportunity as BHP,” he added.\n\nAnglo’s shares surged by 16.1% on Thursday after news of the bid emerged and they are certain to be under the spotlight next week.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) – Reports Thursday 2 May\n\nThe US has the Magnificent 7, Europe has Novo Nordisk and friends, according to UBS.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.05, according to Zacks Equity Research.\n\nNovo Nordisk has become Europe’s most valuable company by market capitalization, taking the crown from luxury group LVMH (LVMUY).\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday April 29\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nVivendi (VIV.PA)\n\nTuesday April 30\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nLufthansa (LHAD.XD)\n\nAir France-KLM (AF.PA)\n\nVolkswagen (VOW.DE)\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD)\n\nSantander (SAN.MC)\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nPaypal (PYPL)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nWednesday May 1\n\nNEXT (NXT.L)\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC)\n\nBarrick Gold (ABX.TO)\n\nMarriot International (MAR)\n\nThursday May 2\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nArcelorMittal (MT.AS)\n\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L)\n\nExpedia (EXPE)\n\nA.P.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Amazon is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AMZN in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 87 cents per share for AMZN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AMZN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.51% heading into earnings season.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that AMZN has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Amazon, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should F5 (FFIV) be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "F5, Inc. FFIV, a multi-cloud application services and security company, is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Apr 29.\n\nThe company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.3%. F5 projects non-GAAP revenues in the $675-$695 million band (midpoint of $685 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $2.79-$2.91 band (midpoint of $2.85) for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for F5’s second-quarter earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.88 per share over the past 30 days and indicates an improvement of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.53. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $686.9 million, which calls for a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, FFIV’s non-GAAP earnings of $3.43 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40 cents and came 39% higher than the year-ago quarter’s $2.47 per share. Revenues of $693 million beat the consensus mark of $687.1 million but declined 1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nDespite facing headwinds in recent quarters, FFIV has shown resilience and remains a dominant player in the networking and application delivery space. With F5 gearing up to report its Q2 earnings, let’s evaluate whether now is the right time to buy this networking giant.\n\nF5, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. Quote\n\nShould You Add FFIV to Your Portfolio Now?\n\nF5 is one of the major players in the application delivery controller (ADC) market, offering vital products for data center consolidation, virtualization and cloud services. Additionally, F5 has gained significant market share due to Cisco's shift away from the core ADC market. It is also a major developer and provider of software-defined application services, ensuring secure, speedy and accessible applications across IP networks on any device and at any time.\n\nF5 stands out to benefit from the booming application networking market. With a strong hold in Layer 4-7 content switching and a solid position in data centers, the company is poised to expand market share, especially given the increasing demand for capacity and security in next-gen applications.\n\nThe growing demand for cloud-based applications, digital transformation and cybersecurity solutions bodes well for F5's long-term growth prospects. As organizations increasingly rely on application delivery and security services to support their digital initiatives, FFIV stands to benefit from these trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile F5's financial performance in recent quarters has been mixed, with revenues and earnings fluctuating due to macroeconomic factors and industry dynamics, the company's resilient business model and cost optimization efforts have helped mitigate some of these challenges.\n\nF5 collaborated with industry leaders, including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware, Cisco Systems and HP, to offer integrated application services for their Software Defined Networking offerings. It has also partnered with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, VMware vCloud Air, Cisco ACI and others for cloud-based application services. These partnerships increase access to new tech, aid product innovation, strengthen F5's cybersecurity suite, support joint sales and marketing efforts and enhance its competitive edge.\n\nThe company is altering its business model by focusing on subscription-based services, which generate steady revenues and increase profits. The company has also made cost-saving moves like reducing staff, trimming facility space and cutting travel. These initiatives are aimed at lowering operating expenses and improving margins in the short run.\n\nIn conclusion, F5 presents an intriguing investment opportunity ahead of its Q2 earnings. Despite near-term challenges, the company's strong fundamentals, growth initiatives and market positioning make it a compelling choice for investors seeking exposure to the networking and cybersecurity sectors. While volatility in the broader market and industry-specific headwinds may impact FFIV's short-term performance, its long-term prospects remain promising.\n\nAdditionally, F5 is among such stocks that have been left behind this year’s tech rally. The stock has gained 1.6% YTD, while the Zacks Internet - Software industry has risen 14.6% during the same time frame. Moreover, F5 currently trades at an attractive valuation multiple. The stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13.65X compared with its five-year average of 29.59X. It also trades at a discount to the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s one-year forward price-to-sales multiple of 35.03X.\n\nTherefore, considering the company’s impressive growth profile and attractive valuation, we believe it is the right time to invest in the stock.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for F5 this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($2.93 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.88 per share), is +1.87%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: FFIV carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Amazon AMZN and Corning GLW also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +28.33%. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while matching on one occasion, with the average surprise being 3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advanced Micro Devices’ first-quarter earnings stands at 60 cents per share, flat when compared to the year-ago quarter. It is estimated to report revenues of $5.42 billion, which suggests an increase of 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAmazon is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +6.19% at present. Amazon’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 51%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 82 cents per share, which suggests an increase of 164.5% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 31 cents. Amazon’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 11.9% year over year to $142.5 billion.\n\nCorning carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.40%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate once, matched one time and missed twice in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 0.12%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corning’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 36 cents per share, which indicates a year-over-year decrease of 12.2%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $3.12 billion, which calls for a year-over-year decrease of 7.2%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the new big thing. The technology is evolving rapidly, and it could substantially contribute to the growth of companies that become leaders in the field.\n\nMany investors are also looking to cash in by investing in those corporations that seem ahead of the pack. There are many options, but e-commerce titan Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the best. Let's find out why it's a great AI play to buy and hold forever.\n\nAmazon's position in AI\n\nThe company has made several moves in AI. Last year, it announced Bedrock, a service it provides through its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Bedrock helps developers build generative AI applications like ChatGPT, whether they focus on speech, pictures, or videos.\n\nAmazon also invested $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI-focused company that developed Claude, a family of generative AI platforms that is competing with GPT-4, the latest version of ChatGPT.\n\nClaude is also the name of the large language model developed by Anthropic that Amazon now offers through Bedrock. A $4 billion investment might seem like a lot, but it's not that much for Amazon, which generated about $32 billion in free cash flow last year. Management seems confident that investments in AI will pay for themselves several times over, and AWS has a run rate of $100 billion.\n\nAI does not account for a large percentage of that total yet, but CEO Andy Jassy said he believes that it is going to \"drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years.\" AWS is already one of Amazon's most important growth drivers, especially on the bottom line, with its much larger margins. Last year, Amazon's total net sales of $574.8 billion increased by 12% year over year.\n\nAWS sales grew slightly faster, by 13.3% year over year, to $90.8 billion -- or just 15.8% of the company's total top line. But its operating income of $24.7 billion made up almost 67% of Amazon's $36.9 billion total operating income. And Amazon's AI work will only improve the performance of AWS.\n\nMore than an AI play\n\nThere are many ways to invest in AI, and doing so through a company like Amazon is a great way to mitigate risk. A pure-play AI company could skyrocket, but it could also sink if its initiatives don't pay off or if the industry doesn't become as big as many analysts currently think it will.\n\nHowever, Amazon's business is strong enough and diversified enough to handle these potential outcomes. The company remains the leader in e-commerce, with a 37.6% share of the U.S. market as of last year. E-commerce still has a long runway for growth, so Amazon will continue to benefit from this market for years. Its e-commerce business enjoys the network effect: The platform becomes stronger and more valuable the more sellers and buyers join it.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat also makes the company's website more attractive to advertisers. Its ad business continues to grow fast, according to management. Elsewhere, the company is a leader in video and music streaming.\n\nBesides its leadership in several industries ripe for growth and a strong competitive edge, something else makes it an outstanding forever stock: The company has developed a culture centered around innovation and a focus on customer satisfaction.\n\nAmazon didn't become a leader in e-commerce or cloud computing by accident. And it will likely continue to invest in promising areas, including its work in healthcare, which is slowly but surely taking form.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Amazon is an excellent stock to cash in on the rise of AI, e-commerce growth, and cloud computing. Long-term investors shouldn't go wrong with this robust, versatile business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Owns All the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. These 3 Are His Favorites.",
        "content": "Few investors deserve the adjective \"legendary.\" Ken Griffin is one of them. He founded Citadel in 1990. It now ranks as the most successful hedge fund of all time.\n\nWith Citadel's portfolio including thousands of holdings, it isn't surprising that Griffin owns all the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. However, three appear to be his favorites.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nCitadel owns a larger position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) than any other individual stock. The only bigger holding for the hedge fund is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. At the end of 2023, Citadel's stake in Nvidia totaled $1.8 billion.\n\nImportantly, Griffin continued to add to Citadel's stake in Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2023. He bought an additional 1.58 million shares, increasing his hedge fund's position in the chipmaker by nearly 77%.\n\nWe can easily guess why the billionaire investor likes Nvidia so much. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have enjoyed staggering demand as organizations scrambled to build, train, and run generative AI applications.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nMicrosoft isn't too far behind Nvidia as the second-largest Magnificant Seven holding for Citadel. However, I wouldn't say the tech giant is Griffin's second-favorite Magnificent Seven stock for a simple reason: He sold nearly 16% of Citadel's stake in Microsoft in Q4. But it's a different story with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAt the end of 2023, Amazon ranked behind Microsoft as Citadel's third-largest individual stock holding. Griffin is clearly bullish about Amazon, evidenced by his increase of Citadel's stake in the stock by almost 223% in Q4.\n\nWhat is so attractive about Amazon? I'd put improving profitability near the top of the list. Griffin also undoubtedly recognizes the tremendous opportunity AI presents for Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Citadel's fifth-largest position excluding the big stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Exiting 2023, Citadel owned 2.46 million shares of the social media giant worth over $869 million.\n\nBefore Q4, Meta wasn't nearly as big of a holding for the hedge fund. Griffin bought 1.37 million shares in the last quarter of 2023, increasing Citadel's stake in Meta by 127%. As was the case for the other top Magnificent Seven stocks, the hedge fund also owned call and put options for Meta.\n\nI think Griffin likes Meta for some of the same reasons he likes Amazon. Meta's bottom line has improved significantly thanks in part to cost-cutting initiatives. The company also should have a major growth opportunity with AI, albeit in some different ways than Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these Magnificent Seven stocks smart picks now?\n\nNvidia, Amazon, and Meta have retreated from their all-time highs in recent weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if they fall further. However, significant pullbacks would create excellent buying opportunities for all three stocks, in my view.\n\nCompetition is increasing in the AI chip market. I don't expect Nvidia to command as formidable a market position going forward as it has so far. On the other hand, the demand for AI chips will almost certainly continue to increase. Nvidia's innovation should keep it on top.\n\nAmazon isn't in danger of giving up its leadership in e-commerce. Its AWS unit might lose market share to other cloud providers, but I still expect it to deliver strong growth as organizations move their apps and data to the cloud. I also look for Amazon to do what it's always done and find new avenues for growth.\n\nMeta has demonstrated the resilience of its social media platforms. AI-powered business messaging could be a key growth driver for the company for years to come. I also like Meta's decision to open up its Horizon virtual reality operating system to third-party device makers.\n\nDoes Ken Griffin still view these Magnificent Seven stocks as good picks? We should find out in a few weeks when Citadel discloses its 2024 first-quarter holdings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Google parent Alphabet has announced its first-ever dividend. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)\n\nAlphabet’s first-quarter revenue jumped 15% as Google’s parent company announced its first-ever dividend of 20 cents a share alongside a $70bn (£56bn) stock buyback.\n\nGoogle posted $80.5bn in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and reported $1.89 in earnings per share, up from $1.17 – beating analysts’ expectations on both counts.\n\nThe company also announced its first dividend, of $0.20 per share, and said the payout would become quarterly.\n\n“Our leadership in AI [artificial intelligence] research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShares in Alphabet were up roughly 15% in premarket trading. The jump pushed Alphabet’s market cap past $2tn.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings per share but the company's Q2 outlook fell short of Wall Street's estimates, sending the stock sliding.\n\nIn the first quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $400m, or 9 cents per share, versus a net loss of $2.8bn, or 66 cents per share, last year.\n\nRevenue was $12.7bn versus $11.7bn a year ago, a 9% year-over-year increase.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as traders digest US tech earnings and Bank of Japan decision\n\nIntel said it anticipates Q2 revenue of between $12.5bn and $13.5bnn. Analysts were anticipating $13.63bn for the coming quarter. “We are making steady progress against our priorities and delivered a solid quarter,” said CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft’s heavy bet on AI appears to be paying off as the world’s largest public company reported $61.86bn revenue for the last quarter.\n\nTotal revenue increased 17% to $61.86bn during the first three months of 2024, the third quarter of its financial year, surpassing analyst expectations of some $60.88bn. Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.94, ahead of the expected $2.83.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Microsoft’s AI-powered earnings demonstrate that doubling down on innovation is paying off,\" Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at Emarketer, told Reuters, pointing to the company's early moves in generative AI, such as its large investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nSales in Microsoft’s cloud division, its biggest revenue driver that includes its Azure computing platform, climbed 21% during the quarter to $26.7bn, compared with analysts’ forecasts for $26.2bn and above company guidance.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon are higher in premarket trading following a pair of strong quarters from mega-cap peers Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter financial results after the US market close on April 30. The company is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.\n\nInvestors should keep an eye out for any fluctuations to the share price at the open following reports that the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to force Amazon to reveal what it tells company leaders about using the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive topics and about preserving documents related to antitrust matters, according to a new court filing.\n\nRead more: UK consumer confidence rises amid personal finance optimism\n\nIn September, the FTC filed a suit against Amazon, arguing that the company has illegally maintained a monopoly and artificially raised prices for consumers.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nBritish mining giant Anglo American has rejected a £31.1bn takeover offer by Australian rival BHP (BHP.L)\n\nThe FTSE 100 miner said the bid was “opportunistic” and “significantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects”.\n\nThe unsolicited approach from BHP would include a structure which “is highly unattractive” for Anglo’s shareholders, “given the uncertainty and complexity inherent in the proposal, and significant execution risks”, the board said.\n\nThe bid would have seen BHP pay £25.08 for every Anglo American share, which would include stock in Anglo subsidiaries Anglo Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nIt would be conditional on Anglo demerging its entire shareholdings in the two businesses to its shareholders.\n\nThe board said that it had unanimously rejected the proposal.\n\nAnglo’s shares surged by 16.1% on Thursday after news of the bid emerged, valuing the miner at £31.4bn and above the offer price from BHP.\n\nWatch: Alphabet's dividend an 'olive branch for investors': Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOG</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOGL</a>) shares surged in after-hours trading on Thursday after the tech giant delivered an earnings beat in the first quarter. Adding to the positive sentiment, the company announced a dividend of $0.20 per share and a share buyback plan.

He refers to the dividend move as \\\"a small little olive branch for investors.\\\"</p>\\n<p>On the subject of artificial intelligence (AI), Zino cautions that investors should not expect \\\"much in terms of product launches\\\" during the earnings call.

        "content": "The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday asked a judge to force Amazon to reveal what it tells company leaders about using the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive topics and about preserving documents related to antitrust matters, according to a new court filing.\n\nIn its filing, the FTC said it seeks \"to compel Amazon to produce documents related to the company’s failure to preserve Signal messages, namely Amazon’s document preservation notices and its instructions about the use of ephemeral messaging applications, including Signal.\"\n\nThe filing marks the latest salvo in what could be a years-long antitrust battle between the regulatory agency and the Seattle-based tech giant. In September, the Lina Khan-run FTC filed a historic suit against Amazon, arguing that the Jeff Bezos-founded company has illegally maintained a monopoly and artificially raised prices for consumers through policies and practices related to the treatment of its hundreds of thousands of Amazon sellers. Amazon has said the suit is meritless and that it will fight it in court; a trial is not slated to begin until October 2026.\n\nIn the fall, the FTC alleged that Amazon executives destroyed evidence by using Signal for communications for several years after the agency had informed the company in 2019 that it was under investigation and should preserve all relevant documents and correspondences. The agency has said that executives, including Bezos and current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, used Signal, which includes a disappearing-message feature that can permanently delete messages if the user turns it on.\n\n\"Amazon executives deleted many Signal messages during Plaintiffs’ pre-Complaint investigation, and Amazon did not instruct its employees to preserve Signal messages until over fifteen months after Amazon knew that Plaintiffs’ investigation was underway,\" the FTC claims in the new filing. \"It is highly likely that relevant information has been destroyed.\"\n\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement: \"The FTC has a complete picture of Amazon’s decision-making in this case including 1.7 million documents from sources like email, internal messaging applications, and laptops (among other sources), and over 100 terabytes of data.”\n\nWhen the FTC's original allegations about evidence destruction went public in the fall, Amazon called them \"baseless\" and argued that Amazon had \"voluntarily\" disclosed the use of Signal to the agency and turned over messages that hadn't automatically been deleted.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in the new filing, the FTC claims that Amazon only did so six days before a news report reported on the use of Signal by company executives.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy.\n\nIn recent years, the streaming TV landscape has seen a rapid expansion, with numerous new options entering the market. With a plethora of subscription internet TV services available, streaming entertainment has become a staple in American households, evidenced by the 99% of U.S. households subscribing to one or more streaming platforms.  Leading the pack are Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s TV+. This widespread adoption reflects a shift in entertainment consumption, moving away from traditional cable TV models towards flexible, on-demand streaming options. On average, Americans maintain subscriptions to around 2.9 streaming services each month.\n\nAccording to a research report by Fortune Business Insights, the video streaming industry is a significant economic force, currently valued at an impressive $544 billion. This valuation not only reflects the industry's current success but also hints at its rapid expansion in the future. Projections suggest that by 2030, the industry could skyrocket to a staggering $1,902 billion. The financial trajectory of the video streaming industry also continues to surge, with revenue expected to reach $43.97 billion in 2024 alone. This robust growth is anticipated to persist, with revenue forecasted to climb to $54.22 billion by 2027, boasting an annual growth rate of 7.53% from 2024 to 2027.\n\nData from Nielsen, a leading data and market measurement firm, proves that the rise of streaming services has fundamentally altered TV viewing habits, with streaming content now being the primary driver of TV usage. In 2023, American audiences streamed a staggering 21 million years of video, marking a 21% increase from the 17 million years' worth they streamed in 2022. Amid these viewership patterns, one clear beneficiary emerged: the TV show \"Suits.\" Originally aired on USA Network from 2011 to 2019, \"Suits\" amassed a total of 57.7 billion viewing minutes in 2023, surpassing even the beloved favorite \"The Office,\" which garnered 57.1 billion viewing minutes in 2020 during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. In total, the top 10 titles in the U.S. collectively garnered over 133 billion minutes of viewing time last year.\n\nHowever, akin to other sectors, the streaming industry encounters its own set of challenges, most notably marked by heightened competition, which has spurred companies to invest billions in developing their own platforms and content libraries, aiming to compete with established industry leaders, which in turn prompted streaming services to adjust their subscription costs. For instance, The Verge reports that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has made changes to its subscription offerings, discontinuing the ad-free Basic plan priced at $11.99 per month for new or returning members. Instead, the company is transitioning to a model where ad-supported plans are available in select countries, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s cheapest ad-free option is now priced at $15.49 per month. This increase in subscription rates can lead to higher number of subscription cancellation, as seen last year. In 2023, data analytics firm Antenna recorded 36.2 million more cancellations compared to the previous year, resulting in 17 million fewer net additions. This indicates that streaming services are facing a greater challenge in acquiring new subscribers despite their continued efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a different note, the music streaming scene in the U.S. has seen substantial evolution over the last decade. Presently, the United States records approximately 90 million paid music streaming subscribers, a significant leap from the mere 7.9 million users in the first half of 2014. Within the competitive realm of music streaming services, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands out as the clear frontrunner, holding a commanding 30.5% market share, while its closest competitor, Apple Music, trails with a 13.7% share.\n\nIn light of this, the burgeoning realms of streaming are not merely flourishing; they are fundamentally reshaping the landscape of entertainment and media consumption. The substantial financial implications, characterized by billions in revenue and considerable monthly expenditure on subscriptions, serve as a testament to the economic prowess wielded by these industries. With that in mind, investors looking to take part in this lucrative industry can look towards some of the best streaming service stocks to invest in, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 10 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Ashley Byrd on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we’ve curated a list of the best streaming service stocks based on hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our analysis of the e-commerce and online retail industry, go directly to the 5 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nE-commerce had been steadily on the rise for a while, but with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns worldwide, consumer adoption skyrocketed: year-over-year growth of e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales surged by 1.6 times in China, 3.3 times in the United States, and 4.5 times in the United Kingdom. In the United States, e-commerce sales penetration more than doubled to 35% in 2020 compared to the previous year, a rate of growth typically seen over a decade. With global internet accessibility and usage continuing to rise, with over five billion users worldwide, the number of online shoppers is steadily growing. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) tops the global chart for online retail websites in terms of traffic. The e-commerce behemoth, renowned for its diverse offerings including e-retail, computing services, consumer electronics, and digital content, recorded 6.1 billion direct visits to its .com website in December 2023. On the other hand, in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Asia's largest online commerce provider, takes the lead.\n\nDespite the resurgence of brick-and-mortar shopping, e-commerce is projected to represent 41% of global retail sales by 2027, a significant surge from its 18% share in 2017, according to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group. Based on a global survey conducted in the second quarter of 2023, the study delves into e-commerce trends from the onset of the pandemic to the previous year. The survey included responses from 410 retail and 415 consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies worldwide, with revenues ranging from $50 million to over $10 billion. The respondents from both industries were categorized as \"winners\" (businesses experiencing post-pandemic growth exceeding 30% per annum and anticipating similar or higher growth by 2027) or \"laggards\" (organizations reporting post-Covid growth of 10% or less per annum and expressing uncertainty about their future e-commerce expansion). Among the surveyed companies, winners accounted for 27% of retailers and 20% of CPG companies, while laggards comprised 21% of retailers and 25% of CPG businesses.\n\nSee also: 12 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nIn addition, according to speculations by e-commerce company Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), global e-commerce sales are projected to reach $6.3 trillion worldwide in 2024, marking a 9.4% annual increase—the second-highest growth rate between 2021 and 2027. This trend indicates a continued rise in online sales, with projections showing even further expansion. By 2025, global e-commerce sales are forecasted to reach $6.9 trillion, followed by an additional $600 billion increase in 2026 to $7.5 trillion, and eventually surpassing $8 trillion by 2027. A significant trend propelling this expansion in the e-commerce landscape is the increasing prevalence of mobile device usage. Recent data indicates that the number of online shoppers worldwide grew by 8.3% in 2022, reaching 4.11 billion individuals, with nearly 60% of online spending attributed to mobile devices. Mobile commerce sales are expected to continue growing, with total sales from mobile devices projected to reach $2.5 trillion in 2024, up from $2.2 trillion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough consumers are returning to physical stores, e-commerce sales are expected to surpass the $6 trillion mark this year, with 20.1% of all retail sales occurring digitally. In addition, data from Emarketer indicates that excluding China, the global e-commerce share will be 12.4%. In light of this, the robust performance of stocks such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) can serve as a compelling incentive for investors exploring opportunities in the online retail sector. These companies are frequently viewed as among the best e-commerce stocks to invest in currently. 10 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nPachai Leknettip/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts, we used a stock screener to list down a number of e-commerce stocks, ranking the firms by their average analyst share price target upside.\n\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 10.53%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $183.62\n\nTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT), an American retail corporation headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, operates a chain of discount department stores and hypermarkets. The majority of its e-commerce net sales are generated within the United States. Target.com, the company’s online platform, offers a diverse range of products spanning various categories, including Hobby & Leisure, Fashion, and Electronics.\n\nOn March 13, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) announced a quarterly dividend of $1.10, payable by June 10 to the shareholders of record on May 15. As of April 14, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.67%.\n\nAs of the end of December 2023, 58 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had invested in the company. The largest shareholder of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital through its $401 million investment.\n\nMuch like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) ranks as one of the best e-commerce stocks to buy.\n\n9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 11.85%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $308.67\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a financial services firm that provides debit cards, credit cards, and associated services. Visa (NYSE:V) distinguishes itself in the e-commerce realm with its robust global payment network, which underpins secure and swift online transactions.\n\nOn January 27, investment advisory firm Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and elevated the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nFor their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 162 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had bought and owned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)’s shares. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management owned the biggest stake that was worth $4.3 billion.\n\n8. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 12.82%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $210.00\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a prominent American multinational technology company, encompasses a diverse range of business interests, including e-commerce, cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company's e-commerce platform offers a wide array of products, including gourmet food, groceries, apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, and more.\n\nInsider Monkey’s database, which monitors 933 elite hedge funds, reveals a positive sentiment towards Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Q4. The number of hedge funds with investments in the stock rose to 293, up from 286 in the previous quarter.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“My previous analysis (Q4 2022 letter) highlighted the significant growth in Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment expenses since 2015, masking the true earnings potential of its retail business. Though initially costly, the recent restructuring into regional fulfillment centers has yielded lower fulfillment costs and faster shipping times, leading to increased purchase frequency, especially among Prime members.\n\nFollowing the regionalization effort, over the last couple of years, Amazon prioritized cost control and reduced capital expenditures. At a high level, the North American segment’s operating income swung from a $240 million loss in 2022 to a healthy $6.4 billion profit (6% margin) in 2023. Combined with continued strength in AWS and advertising, Amazon’s free cash flow (as reported, excluding equipment finance leases and principal repayments) surged from negative $13 billion to positive $36 billion.\n\nAmazon stands out for pioneering the public market strategy of prioritizing long-term growth through sustained low margins and reinvestment, with the ability to later “turn on the taps” for profit. While many public tech companies have tried to replicate this approach, Amazon’s scale and execution capabilities make it one of the few that have successfully pulled it off.”\n\n7. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 14.05%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $76.47\n\nEtsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), headquartered in Brooklyn, New York, operates two-sided online marketplaces connecting millions of creative buyers and sellers worldwide. Its primary marketplace, Etsy, focuses on unique and creative goods, and the company also oversees Reverb, Depop, and Elo7. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s marketplaces have approximately 8.8 million active sellers and over 97 million active buyers.\n\nAccording to the Insider Monkey Database, 36 out of the 933 tracked hedge funds held stakes in Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) as of the end of the fourth quarter. Bares Capital Management remained the most significant stockholder with stakes worth $330.71 million.\n\n6. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Upside: 17.01%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $82.84\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stands as a pivotal provider of internet infrastructure for commerce, equipping businesses with tools to launch, expand, promote, and manage retail operations across various magnitudes. With its platform and services utilized by millions of businesses spanning 175 countries, Shopify plays an instrumental role in supporting a diverse spectrum of enterprises.\n\nIn its analysis of 933 hedge fund holdings for Q4 2023, Insider Monkey unearthed 68 investments in the firm. Notably, the largest investor in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) among these is Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital, holding 20.9 million shares valued at $1.6 billion.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its 2023 annual investor letter:\n\n\"Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is an all-in-one e-commerce platform that empowers businesses of all sizes to build, manage, and grow their online stores. Founded in 2006, Shopify now holds a commanding >10% market share in US e-commerce.\n\nThe value of Shopify lies in its simplicity for merchants to easily start and scale their business, so much so that merchants fall in love with their solutions and never want to leave, no matter how big they get. They understand that as they grow and confront new challenges, Shopify will solve their problems so they can take their business to the next level. That is the power of Shopify's flywheel.\n\nWe have owned Shopify’s stock since 2022. Our average cost basis is $60. Following our purchase, the stock hit a low of $26 in October 2022. Just 15 months following those lows, Shopify stock is now trading at $80 (a 200% rebound) as investors celebrated the decision to sell its capital intensive logistics business, which was largely expected to cost billions of dollars to build out — a move that enables Shopify to retain its original, asset-light business model. Additionally, while many tech companies struggled in the face of macroeconomic challenges, Shopify defied expectations by maintaining robust revenue growth in 2023. Revenue increased by 25% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, with gross profit growing by a healthy 36%. We are now sitting on a +35% unrealized gain on our position after owning the stock for almost 2 years. Not a bad return, but what a wild ride it has been. Just another example that volatility is the price of admission in this business.\"\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) joins the ranks of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) as one of the best e-commerce stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks 11 Best Italian Stocks To Invest In 2024 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYou have to spend money to make money\n\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\n\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\n\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\n\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited in the pursuit of AI\n\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\n\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday. Chinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports. The potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. MSFT Chart\n\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI. Investors should ignore the short-term volatility and buy the dip.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos Has Been Predicting Amazon's 'Inevitable Death' For Years And Says Lifespans Of Large Companies 'Tend To Be 30-Plus Years' Not 100\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Founder Jeff Bezos has always been unusually frank about the potential decline and eventual demise of his company. This sentiment has been a recurring theme in his communications, expressing a clear understanding that even the mightiest companies have limited lifespans.\n\nBezos has often used this perspective as a rallying cry to drive innovation at Amazon, pushing the company to stay ahead of potential decline through continuous evolution and reinvention.\n\nUnder Bezos's leadership, Amazon has grown into a colossal tech and retail giant, yet he has consistently reminded stakeholders of the company's mortality. Between 2013 and 2018, he openly discussed Amazon's “inevitable” death on multiple occasions, even predicting during a 2018 all-hands meeting that “Amazon will go bankrupt” one day.\n\n“If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not 100-plus years,” he said, emphasizing that many large companies do not last beyond several decades.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively? Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds’ Exclusive 8% Yield Fund.\n\nThis outlook was also evident in his final letter to shareholders in 2021, when Bezos quoted biologist Richard Dawkins, saying, “Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at.”\n\nHere, Bezos likened the effort required to maintain the vitality of a living organism to the efforts required to keep a company thriving. He warned against the company becoming too typical and losing its distinctiveness, equating corporate stagnation with death.\n\nBezos often reinforced this point with his Day One philosophy, asserting that for Amazon, it must always be Day One. This mindset focuses on maintaining the agility, curiosity and urgency of a startup. He articulated that moving to Day Two implies stasis, irrelevance and slow decline, which he saw as the beginning of the end.\n\nThese acknowledgments of Amazon’s possible future serve not just as warnings but as motivation. Bezos has aimed to cultivate an organizational culture that pursues innovation and operational excellence to stave off the decline that he views as inevitable without such effort. His leadership philosophy suggests that recognizing and confronting the prospect of failure can galvanize a company to maintain its competitive edge and vitality.\n\nTrending\n\nWant to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail\n\nStory continues\n\nBezos stepped down as CEO but moved into the role of executive chairman to continue influencing Amazon's path, albeit in a different capacity.\n\nEarlier this year, Bezos sold 50 million Amazon shares, netting approximately $8.5 billion. The financial move was part of a broader strategy that included his relocation from Seattle to Miami,  a decision influenced by personal and business considerations. His move to Florida was particularly advantageous because of the state’s favorable tax laws, allowing him to save about $600 million in taxes he would have incurred under Washington’s capital gains tax, introduced in 2021.\n\nHe has made significant real estate investments in Florida, spending hundreds of millions on properties in the ultra-exclusive Billionaire Bunker. He purchased one estate for $90 million and two others for a combined $149 million.\n\nBezos’s transition to Florida also marked a shift in focus toward his aerospace company Blue Origin, which benefits from proximity to Cape Canaveral — a key location for launching and manufacturing rockets and spacecraft. This strategic relocation supports his vision for space exploration and Blue Origin’s expansion, which is expected to boost local investment and job creation.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

        "content": "Rogers Communications Canada Inc.\n\nTwo-year agreement among Rogers, Amazon and the NHL brings live games to more fans across more devices\n\nTORONTO, April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Rogers Communications, and the National Hockey League (NHL) today announced a milestone two-year agreement in Canada to bring hockey fans Monday night NHL hockey exclusively on Prime Video.\n\nPrime Monday Night Hockey will stream all national regular season Monday night NHL games in English for the 2024/25 and 2025/26 NHL seasons.

        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) gained as much as 13% in after-hours trading Thursday, following a stand-out quarter that beat revenue and earnings estimates and stoked investor excitement with the announcement of a cash dividend program of $0.20 per share.\n\nThe board of directors also approved stock repurchases up to an additional $70 billion.\n\n“Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,\" said CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement. \"Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.”\n\nHere are some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $67.59 billion vs. $66.07 billion expected ($58.07 billion in Q1 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 vs. $1.53 expected ($1.17 in Q1 2023) Cloud revenue: $9.58 billion vs. $9.37 billion expected ($7.45 billion in Q1 2023) Ad revenue: $61.66 billion vs. $60.18 billion expected ($54.55 billion in Q1 2023)\n\nIn artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle has also been working to claim additional share of the cloud market, where it currently sits in third place behind rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet's report arrived a day after its advertising rival and Big Tech peer Meta (META) offered a downbeat Q2 forecast and noted that expenses for the year are growing and that it will take some time before AI investments generate significant revenue.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Walgreens launches specialty pharmacy unit to compete in new PBM era",
        "content": "Walgreens (WBA) is standing up a new specialty pharmacy segment to compete in an increasingly crowded pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and specialty pharmacy space.\n\nThe company announced Thursday its new business unit and brand name: Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy.\n\nThe business \"rolls up all Walgreens specialty pharmacy segment assets, including AllianceRx,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAllianceRx is the combined entity that Walgreens and its then-partner and PBM Prime Therapeutics formed in 2017 that will merge into the new business unit in August.\n\n\"With approximately $24 billion in annual enterprise specialty revenue, Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy is the largest independent provider that offers the industry's most robust specialty capabilities not vertically aligned with a pharmacy benefit manager,” said Rick Gates, chief pharmacy officer, in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, vice president of pharmacy and specialty trade Pat Lupo said the target market is payers of health benefits — including insurance companies and large self-pay companies that are interested in diversifying their offerings.\n\nThe cost-cutting trend started in 2023 when Blue Shield of California split its pharmacy benefits between five entities, including newcomers Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN) and Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs — but maintained CVS Caremark (CVS) for specialty pharmacy.\n\n\"What we are doing with our combination of assets ... is creating something new from a pharmacy delivery platform perspective and integrated model, where we actually occupy a very strong middle ground between the big three integrated specialty pharmacy and the niche, very small bespoke specialty pharmacy,\" Lupo said.\n\nHe added that the combined revenue of the segment gives the company a chance to compete with the big three and place fourth. The big three include CVS, UnitedHealth's OptumRx (UNH), and Cigna's (CI) Evernorth Health Services, which includes Express Scripts.\n\nIn 2023, CVS reported mail and specialty revenue of $68 billion, or 6.5% growth versus 2022. OptumRx reported $63 billion in specialty pharmacy revenue in 2023, while Evernorth reported nearly $66 billion in revenue.

(dbdurden via Getty Images)\n\nBeyond PBM\n\nThe company anticipates not only working with private payers but also providing services to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to managing the benefits, Walgreens said it would be able to help patients through 300 specialty pharmacies across the country, as well as four central specialty pharmacies.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is looking at ways to expand specialty drug needs into the future, with an eye on gene and cell services. Walgreens announced a new 18,000-square-foot center in Pittsburgh that would provide services for these newer therapies, including playing a role in \"the supply chain, logistics and financing,\" according to the statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe announcement Thursday comes amid investor doubts as new CEO Tim Wentworth shifts gears away from vertical integration — to include a focus on providing clinical care services — and refocuses the company in ways that target various aspects of drug and drug delivery.\n\nThat includes maintaining a clinical trial program, which competitor CVS backed out of last year, and giving retail store managers more control over how to engage with their local communities and drive business growth decisions.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "NEW CARLISLE, Ind. (AP) — Amazon ’s cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services plans to invest $11 billion to build a data center in northern Indiana that will create at least 1,000 new jobs, state and company officials announced Thursday.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb called the project planned near the town of New Carlisle, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of South Bend, “the largest capital investment announcement in Indiana’s history.\"\n\n“This significant investment solidifies Indiana’s leadership position in the economy of the future, and will undoubtedly have a positive ripple effect on the town of New Carlisle, the north central region and the state of Indiana for years to come,” Holcomb said in a news release.\n\nThe announcement from Holcomb's office and AWS did not include a timeline for the data center campus in northern Indiana's St. Joseph County, which abuts the Michigan state line.\n\nBut Carl Baxmeyer, president of the St. Joseph County Board of Commissioners, said in the news release that it would be built “over the next decade” at the Indiana Enterprise Center, located just east of New Carlisle, and “will be a major employment center for all of northern Indiana.”\n\nThe AWS data center would contain computer servers, data storage drives, networking equipment, “and other forms of technology infrastructure used to power cloud computing capabilities, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,” according to the news release.\n\nRoger Wehner, AWS director of economic development, said the Indiana data center “will create numerous well-paying job opportunities and tap into the state’s burgeoning tech sector, while contributing significantly to the state’s growing economy.”\n\nBased on the company 's planned investment, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has committed to providing data center sales tax exemptions “for eligible capital investments over a 50-year term,\" the release states.\n\nThe IEDC has also committed to a variety of performance-based tax credits to support the AWS data center plans, including up to $18.3 million in headcount-based tax credits, up to $55 million in Hoosier Business Investment tax credits, and up to $20 million in redevelopment tax credits, the release states.\n\nAWS will provide up to $7 million to support road infrastructure improvements along State Road 2, surrounding the company’s planned data center, according to the release.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wall Street analysts forecast that Amazon (AMZN) will report quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 164.5%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $142.53 billion, exhibiting an increase of 11.9% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 1.6% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Amazon metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- AWS' to reach $24.26 billion. The estimate points to a change of +13.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net sales- Physical stores' should arrive at $5.06 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net sales- Online stores' at $54.76 billion. The estimate points to a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Sales- Subscription services' will reach $10.68 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- North America' stands at $85.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +11% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Sales- Advertising services' of $11.87 billion. The estimate points to a change of +24.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue - International' will likely reach $32.74 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +12.4% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' should come in at $34.48 billion. The estimate points to a change of +15.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' will reach 10.8%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 15%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' will reach 15.6%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 18%.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Headcount - Total' to come in at 1,496,412. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 1,465,000 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'WW shipping costs' reaching $21.69 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $19.94 billion.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, Amazon shares have recorded returns of -1.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "If you’re wondering what stocks to sell this quarter, you’re in the right place. Nothing lasts forever, not even stocks. During a 2018 all-hands meeting, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and then CEO Jeff Bezos famously said: “I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.” Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was on the verge of going bankrupt in 1997 before rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) saved the then struggling company with a $150 million investment. History is littered with once famous companies and stocks that no longer exist.\n\nSince the turn of the century, a number of once high-flying stocks have gone the way of the dodo bird. Names such as Blockbuster Video, Pets.com, and Enron, to cite only a few. These companies, and others, failed after losing their competitive edge, being mismanaged or engaging in fraud. So, which stocks are next to disappear? What companies are most in danger of ceasing operations in the near-term. There are plenty of concerns to choose from. Here are seven stocks that could be heading six-feet under.\n\nStocks to Sell: Tilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis producer Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is awash in red ink. The company recently reported a quarterly loss of $105 million and lowered its forward guidance as its sales continue to crumble. The company said that it lost 12 cents a share for the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 29. Revenue totalled $188.3 million. While the latest results were better than a loss of $1.20 billion and revenue of $145.6 million recorded a year earlier, the latest earnings print shows that Tilray Brands remains in financial straits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of guidance, Tilray said that it expects earnings of only $60 million to $63 million for its entire 2024 financial year as its cannabis sales dry up. The newest guidance is down from earlier estimates of $78 million in earnings. Insult to injury, management at Tilray said that they no longer expect positive free cash flow this financial year. TLRY stock continues to slide lower, with the share price dropping 21% after its latest financial results and guidance were made public.\n\nThe stock is now down 97% over the last five years and trading at less than two bucks.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) A white clock indicates it's time to sell.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAside from its association with former president Donald Trump, there’s not much to recommend Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). The company is barely afloat, having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million on just $4.1 million in revenues. Since going public in late March of this year through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, DJT stock has largely collapsed. The share price is currently 60% below its 52-week high and has fallen 50% since March 27 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nComplicating matters is the huge allotment of stock given to former president Trump. In all, Donald Trump’s stake in the media company stands at $4 billion based on the current share price. He owns more than 100 million. The shares that Donald Trump owns are subject to a lock-up period that prevents him from selling them during the first six months following the company going public. But there is speculation that he will sell his stake in the media company as soon as possible. What happens to DJT stock then?\n\nStocks to Sell: Paramount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s never good when board members resign from a company en masse. But that’s what recently happened at Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) when four board directors announced their departure together. Dawn Ostroff, a former Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) executive; Nicole Seligman, former president of Sony Entertainment (NYSE:SONY); Frederick Terrell, an investment banker; and Rob Klieger, an attorney, are each leaving the board. The resignations come as Paramount Global tries to sell itself.\n\nSince the start of the year, Paramount has been involved in aborted merger talks with Warner Bros. Discovery (NYSE:WBD), received a $26 billion all-cash takeover offer from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) that the board declined, and, most recently, entered into exclusive discussions with privately held Skydance Media about a potential takeover or merger. Skydance has entered into a 30-day exclusive negotiating period with Paramount’s board, though a deal is not guaranteed.\n\nIf all goes well, Paramount Global will be purchased, taken private, and its stock delisted. Or, a merged company could survive as different publicly traded entity. What is clear at this point is that Paramount’s future looks tentative at best. PARA stock is down 75% over the last five years, including a 43% decline in the last 12 months.\n\nNordstrom (JWN) Bright red graphic of stock arrow headed sharply downward beside downward bar graph. Stocks to Never Buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nSpeaking of going private, the family behind U.S. department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has created a special committee to evaluate bids aimed at taking the department store chain private. This as the 123-year-old company struggles with a decline in sales as shopping increasingly moves online. Last summer, Nordstrom closed all of its locations in Canada after less than a decade in the country, shutting down multiple outlets following huge liquidation sales.\n\nThe special committee has been set-up to evaluate proposals aimed at taking Nordstrom private, delisting JWN stock in the process. The company has been down this road before. In 2017, private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners came close to taking Nordstrom private but the deal fell through because of a dispute over price. The latest take private action comes after Nordstrom-issued weak guidance for the year ahead amid soft demand, lagging sales, bloated inventory levels, and increasing markdowns.\n\nJWN stock is down 52% over the past five years.\n\nStocks to Sell: GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that video game retailer and meme stock favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) was talking about becoming the “Amazon of gaming.” Such talk has since faded amid a failed turnaround strategy, successive earnings misses, and ongoing share price declines. Despite repeated efforts, GameStop has not managed to move its business online and meaningfully shrink its retail chain of video game stores that are seeing less foot traffic.\n\nAt the end of March, GME stock plunged 18% after the company reported weak financial results for the final quarter of 2023 that included the year-end holiday shopping season. GameStop announced earnings of 22 cents and revenue of $1.79 billion. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of 30 cents per share and sales of $2.05 billion. Hardware and accessories sales fell 12% year-over-year while software sales declined 31% in the quarter. The company’s sales have steadily eroded as consumers purchase games online.\n\nThe newest turnaround plan will see GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen invest the company’s excess cash in stocks and cryptocurrencies, a move that has made more than a few analysts and investors cringe. In the last 12 months, GME stock has fallen 49%, including a 39% pullback so far in 2024.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Smartphone with logo of Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth Corporation on screen in front of web page. Cannabis plants are in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nCanopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) is another cannabis producer that is in dire straits and has landed itself on this stocks to sell list. In recent months, the company has sold its corporate headquarters, issued more stock to raise money, and placed part of its business under creditor protection. Canopy Growth’s latest earnings showed a net loss of $216.8 million. That compares with a net loss of $264.4 million a year earlier. Revenue for what was the company’s fiscal third quarter totalled $78.5 million, down 8% from $84.9 million a year earlier.\n\nCanopy Growth continues to struggle with declining sales and a loss of market share. Over the past five years, CGC stock has plunged 98%. Last December, the company executed a reverse stock split to artificially raise its share price. The company consolidated its shares on a one-for-10 basis on Dec. 15. Reverse stock splits are, rightfully, seen by markets as an act of desperation by companies that are trying to artificially boost their share price, often to avoid being delisted from a stock exchange, in this case the Nasdaq.\n\nExpress (EXPRQ) Photo of stair of coins with red arrow headed downward over top of the coin stacks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pla2na\n\nClothing retailer Express (OTC:EXPRQ), a fixture at American shopping malls, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to close more than 100 stores. The company, whose portfolio of brands includes Bonobos and UpWest Express, listed assets of $1 billion against liabilities of $10 billion in its bankruptcy filing. As part of the bankruptcy process, the company is closing 95 Express retail stores and about a dozen UpWest stores. In all, the company operates 530 Express retail and Express Factory Outlet stores nationwide.\n\nIn business since 1980, Express has struggled with slowing consumer spending and a shift to online shopping. The company said that it has received a commitment for $35 million in new financing from existing lenders and plans to conduct business as usual while it goes through a restructuring process. Privately held brand management firm WHP Global, which owns fashion label Anne Klein, took a 7.4% stake in Express last year. But to look at the stock price, it appears to be only a matter of time for Express.\n\nThis year alone, EXPRQ stock has fallen 90% and now trades deep down on the penny stock league tables, making it one of those stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Maverick Tech Picks: 7 Stocks to Scoop Up While the Crowd Panics",
        "content": "Investors continue adjusting to the notion that interest rates may not come down as much as expected in 2024. That mindset shift is manifesting as something of a panic in the markets. As a result, contrarian tech stock picks are falling; the S&P 500 has fallen for five straight days as I write this.\n\nHowever, investors shouldn’t panic. Instead, I think there is an opportunity because while this April has been a difficult one, it’s historically one of the two strongest months for the stock market, along with December. That truth implies room for a rebound in the latter portions of this month.\n\nFurthermore, investors are more likely to adapt to the idea of higher rates for longer than they are to abandon the massive opportunity in artificial intelligence. To me, that suggests lower tech share prices are an opportunity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can’t understand why investors should logically be concerned about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  stock overall. I don’t have any precise statistics to back up this notion. However, buying Microsoft every time it drops 5% would be a winning strategy.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened between April 15 and April 19 — following my logic, that makes Microsoft a stock to scoop up while the crowd panics over rate cuts and rising Treasury yields.\n\nWhile Microsoft certainly meets those short-term criteria, the company’s long-term growth expoalm investors’ nerves. The value of the AI Tech Market was estimated at $200 billion in 2023. It is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion in value by 2030. Microsoft is one of the leading firms best exposed to that growth. That truth is evident in the 24% growth in its Cloud business during the most recent quarter. The company has invested massively in AI, especially in the business segment.\n\nThat brings me to my next point: the cloud. That particular market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 16.4% between 2024 and 2029. There, too, Microsoft is a leader.\n\nThe sky is not falling, and Microsoft will continue to appreciate.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf investors need reassurance about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, it can be found in the news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).\n\nInvestors are currently worried that markets may be amid a giant AI bubble. Combine that with the fact that rate cuts that would spur their growth may not now occur in 2024. The result is fear manifesting as exits from once red hot Nvidia shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing provides the perfect counterpoint to that notion. The world’s biggest foundry announced that first quarter revenue was boosted by demand for AI chips. Furthermore, the company noted that AI chips should account for 10% of overall revenue this year, rising to 20% by 2028.\n\nThat should be an immediate boon to Nvidia as it is the leading chip producer overall. Demand for its semiconductors should be expected to rise on the TSMC news. Based on TSMC forecasts, AI chip demand should double by 2028. That, too, should be a boon to Nvidia, although that longer time frame opens the door to competition. It’s logical to assume that other firms could erode Nvidia’s competitive advantage by 2028. The TSMC news should be enough to halt Nvidia’s downward trajectory for now.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe logic for Nvidia also applies to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and its stock. The crowd has panicked. AMD shares trade for $155 as I write this. They were trading as high as $211 five weeks ago. That sharp reversal is indicative of the fear that now dominates.\n\nYet, I would caution investors to ignore that fear based on the abovementioned information. Demand for AI chips is going to remain strong throughout 2024. TSMC produces roughly 50% of all AI chips, so its opinions are particularly pertinent. Its conviction that AI chip revenues will account for 10% of its business in 2024 is a strong vote of confidence for AMD and others.\n\nAMD is also currently engaged in a pitched battle against Nvidia to dominate AI chips. It remains a dark horse in the race but is also a firm with significant advantages, especially in pricing. TSMC Raised concerns about prices in that recent announcement. That’s important for AMD because the company produces chips at lower prices and a high value. If the market suddenly perceives value as a primary factor, then AMD will shoot up.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an excellent stock for several reasons. It is suffering, and prices have fallen as the crowd panicked over the last week. However, there are multiple reasons to remain optimistic about Amazon.\n\nFirstly, investors should have confidence in Amazon’s e-commerce business. The company continues to grow at a double-digit rate precisely because of its dominance over the e-commerce space. That’s the company’s main driver, and it will continue to grow. Amazon provides low-cost options that make it relevant for the next decade and beyond. Consumers will always want the lowest-cost option; it is as simple as that.\n\nYet, Amazon is so much more than e-commerce alone. In the most recent shareholder letter, Amazon management noted that the company is increasingly confident in Prime Video as a standalone business. Amazon is also developing its in-house chips, a big trend that every investor should follow at all major tech companies.\n\nAmazon has also invested $150 billion into AI data centers over the next 15 years. It isn’t easy to envision a future in which Amazon doesn’t continue to thrive.\n\nGoogle (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock perfectly exemplifies something I mentioned above about Amazon’s in-house chip development efforts.\n\nMost investors are well aware of the pushback against high chip prices from leading suppliers, including Nvidia. Big Tech is a major buyer of those chips. They can’t afford to pay those high prices because the war for AI computing power is in full swing.\n\nHowever, Google and others are unwilling to remain a captive audience for Nvidia indefinitely. Google has been developing AI chips for a decade. The company recently expanded its in-house chip development efforts. It’s crystal clear that Google aims to reduce its reliance on major chip makers. That’s true across all of big tech.\n\nGoogle understands what it needs in a chip best. At some point, it and other big tech firms may very well develop superior chips for their own purposes.\n\nWhile that proof probably doesn’t matter much about the current market panic, it’s one reason to consider scooping up Google.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is an excellent investment in general and particularly well-suited to the current market.\n\nThe company is an integral part of the AI supply chain and benefits from secular opportunities moving forward. Broadcom develops semiconductor infrastructure software. In everyday speech, the company helps chip firms derive greater power And AI output from a given chip.\n\nThat should position Broadcom to benefit for a long time as AI continues to develop. Currently, it manifests as a very strong fundamental. Top-line results increased by 34% in the most recent quarter. The company also repurchased and eliminated approximately $8.3 billion worth of shares.\n\nBroadcom stock includes a steady dividend, making it a more stable investment in AI. There’s a lot to like overall, including that revenues are expected to increase by 40% in 2024.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) stock has been especially battered by the current panic in the market. However, it’s an excellent opportunity to pick up shares.\n\nThe same reason Micron has fallen so precipitously is the same reason that it previously rose so quickly. It’s also why you should remain steadfast as an investor or buy if you haven’t.\n\nMicron has been handpicked as a supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) by Nvidia. That was why it shot up so quickly in the last month.  The HBM market is dominated by Micron and two South Korean firms, Samsung and SK Hynix. Continued reshoring efforts should benefit Micron, and its current relationship with Nvidia is strong.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reassured the market that AI chip demand remains strong. In turn, Nvidia should continue to be strong, which, in turn, makes Micron strong as an integral supplier to Nvidia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is slowly losing its shine. Unlike rivals like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that have seen a boost from recent earnings, the outlook for Rivian stock is decidedly more mixed.\n\nDespite its key partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Rivian’s February 2024 report disappointed, leading to a significant stock price drop. In 2023, the company reported a whopping $5.7 billion operating loss and $5.4 net operating loss.\n\nThis has raised some concerns from its investors in terms of stability. Thus, selling RIVN stock may be a good choice now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, although there has been a recent stock price decline, Rivian offers promising long-term EV investment prospects.\n\nIts unique focus on adventure-oriented EVs like the R1T sets it apart. With a strong $7 billion cash reserve, Rivian can still be well-positioned to overcome its challenges.\n\nAnalysts maintain optimism, with an average price target of $17.50, indicating a potential upside of nearly 100%. Let’s dive into whether this stock is a buy, sell or hold in this regard.\n\n$5,000 Gas Car Trade-In Deal\n\nTo celebrate Earth Day, Rivian announced some trade-in discount deals with $5,000 off for customers to would trade in select gas vehicles. This includes their R1T or R1S models. Customers will also receive a one-year free charging on the Rivian Adventure Network on top of the $5,000 discount.\n\nRivian emailed to mark Earth Day, emphasizing their commitment to eco-friendly vehicles. The company introduced the Electric Upgrade Offer, granting up to $5,000 off on a new R1 when trading in select gas-powered cars. The offer includes one year of free charging on the Rivian Adventure Network (powered by 100% renewable energy).\n\nThis promotion is open to U.S. and Canadian residents purchasing or leasing an R1 between April 22 and June 30 and applies to specific R1 configurations.\n\nGeorgia EV Plant Confirmed, But Postponed\n\nThe EV company delayed construction but remains committed to building electric vehicles in Georgia. Despite the setback, Rivian introduced the R2, a smaller, more affordable electric SUV, and opted to start production at its Normal, IL facility instead of the planned $5B Georgia plant.\n\nRivian’s chief policy officer reiterated the company’s commitment to Georgia and its new plant in a response letter on April 18. The letter emphasized compliance with environmental regulations and ongoing coordination with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.\n\nWhile vertical construction is delayed, Rivian will maintain the site, aiming to be ready to start construction once the pause is lifted. Rivian pledged to provide continuous communication and updates to partners and the community throughout the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nPartnership with MEVCO\n\nMEVCO also recently partnered exclusively with Rivian to supply EVs to the mining sector, aiming for sustainable, efficient electric fleets. CEO Matt Cahir sees Rivian’s R1T as ideal for mining challenges, combining Rivian’s tech with MEVCO’s expertise for top-tier mining vehicles.\n\nThe shift to electric solutions offers safety benefits, especially in underground mines. Rivian R1T, known for safety and off-road abilities, earned top safety awards. Dagan Mishoulam, Rivian VP, is pleased MEVCO chose Rivian to electrify its fleet.\n\nAnalysts Downgrade RIVN Stock\n\nRivian continues its winning streak despite mixed Wall Street sentiments. Following Barclays’ (NYSE:BCS) downgrade last week, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) also reduced its RIVN stock price target from $11 to $10 per share.\n\nDespite market volatility in recent days, Rivian has shown resilience, rallying and entering positive territory in premarket trading, driven by Tesla’s recent announcements.\n\nWhile the increase is marginal, with RIVN stock up by 0.87% as of writing, it’s notable given recent downgrades from major Wall Street firms.\n\nBottom Line on Rivian Stock\n\nDespite recent challenges, Rivian still maintains a positive outlook. The stock has a decline of more than 50% over the past six months, suggesting the market disagrees.\n\nAccordingly, with Rivian also announcing additional layoffs, reducing 1% of its workforce, the outlook for this stock remains uncertain. JPMorgan, although still optimistic for Rivian, changed their price targets to $9 per share.\n\nInvestors are losing patience with Rivian stock, unsure of its bottom. Investing in Rivian relies on faith in its innovation, R2’s success, and a successful capital raise.\n\nRivian’s story highlights the importance of profitability in growth companies to avoid market backlash. In my view, it may be dangerous to take a bullish position in RIVN stock, with the above-mentioned factors likely to outweigh any positive developments with this company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "Dips present long-term buying opportunities for investors who can wait for conditions to improve. Some corporations exhibit stock price declines due to temporary industry-specific headwinds or macroeconomic headlines.\n\nGrowth stocks have the potential to outperform the market, but those great expectations also come with heightened volatility. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are both still up year-to-date, but both of these indices have been sliding to start the second quarter. Things can get worse before they get better, but these growth stocks offer enticing opportunities for investors who can look to 2030 and beyond.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to expand its lead in the artificial intelligence race. The company also has dominant positions in the cloud computing, gaming, advertising, and business software industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts can’t get enough of the stock and believe that it has a 19% upside from the current price. Microsoft is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.” Financials came in good in Q2 FY24 as the company reported 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 33% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty of opportunities to generate higher growth rates and reward investors with steady cash flow. The stock has been shedding some of its gains since April and is approaching correction territory. The development has brought Microsoft below the $3 trillion valuation. Shares now trade at a 36 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% dividend yield. Long-term returns have been good as the stock has more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a promising semiconductor stock that is in the middle of a correction. Shares are down by roughly 15% from their all-time highs and currently trade at a 57 P/E ratio.\n\nThe chipmaker has exhibited impressive growth rates to warrant the valuation. The firm reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth and 65% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nSynopsys looks ready to gain market share through its pending acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Once Synopsys clears regulatory hurdles, the two companies will join forces in a move that can reward long-term investors.\n\nSynopsys is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 10 analysts with an average price target of $630 per share. This price target suggests a 23% upside from the current price. The stock has received recent price targets above the average, with one target as high as $675. This price target implies a 32% gain from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s leading online marketplace that generated $574.8 billion in net sales in full-year 2023. That’s a 12% year-over-year increase. Amazon accelerated sales growth in Q4 2023 by posting 14% year-over-year growth during that timeframe. Success with domestic and international markets contributed to $170.0 billion in total Q4 2023 revenue.\n\nThe company continues to grow in multiple verticals. E-commerce is the company’s biggest growth engine, but Amazon Web Services, advertising, and streaming are also key contributors with immense potential.\n\nAmazon is approaching correction territory like many large-cap tech stocks. The company’s improving profit margins and declining P/E ratio can make it a pick to consider for long-term investors. The tech giant has the largest market share in cloud computing and looks poised to strengthen its profit margins in the coming quarters. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe that it can deliver a 21% upside from current levels. The stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.”\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has an immense 40% upside based on the average price targets from 40 analysts. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” with the highest price target of $435 per share suggesting a 54% upside.\n\nThe company’s Falcon Platform has become an essential resource for many business owners who want to keep their companies and stakeholders safe from cyberattacks. Hackers can do a lot of damage if they infiltrate systems and access sensitive data and documents. Most companies don’t want to take that risk and prefer to invest in cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe dynamic has worked well for Crowdstrike which recently delivered record profitability and sales. Total revenue reached $845.3 million in Q4 FY24. It’s a 33% year-over-year increase. Annual recurring revenue jumped by 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion. Rising profit margins can make the 75 forward P/E ratio more manageable.\n\nThe stock is in the middle of a correction and has dropped by more than 10% since the start of April. This development can increase the stock’s appeal for investors who are window shopping.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) delivers impressive growth rates across the board. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year in Q4 2023 while daily and monthly active users increased by 65% and 46% year-over-year respectively. The language learning app now has 88.4 million monthly active users and closed the quarter with $12.1 million in net income. That’s a big change from the $13.9 million net loss posted in the same period last year.\n\nThe educational tech company has a lot going for it in the long run, but investors have to contend with a 122 forward P/E ratio. The stock’s current correction can help, especially if it gets deeper. Equities have had a rough start to the second quarter, but investors who have 10-year time horizons may be able to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nDuolingo’s 51% year-over-year increase in total bookings suggests that the strong financial results can continue. Analysts also feel optimistic and believe the stock has a 24% upside from current levels. Duolingo is currently rated as a “Moderate Buy.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a projected 14% upside and a “Strong Buy” rating amid a correction. The company continues to attract new users and reported an 8% year-over-year increase in daily active users.\n\nUser growth contributed to the company’s record earnings. Revenue grew by 25% year-over-year to reach $40.1 billion in Q4 2023. Net income more than tripled during the same period to reach $14.0 billion. The significant profit margin expansion prompted the company to establish its first quarterly dividend. The dividend is low at just $0.50 per share each quarter, but investors should expect the company to hike the dividend by 10% or more for several years.\n\nMeta Platforms is the leading social media giant and generates most of its revenue from advertisements. Adventures into artificial intelligence and virtual reality can create additional revenue streams for the company.\n\nGuidance also came in pretty good. The company anticipates Q1 2024 revenue to range from $34.5 billion to $37.0 billion. Meta Platforms generated $28.6 billion in Q1 2023. The company’s guidance for Q1 2024 implies a year-over-year growth rate ranging from 20.6% to 29.4%.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the few fairly valued growth stocks remaining. The valuation isn’t just based on what the company can become, but it’s already reasonable given the firm’s current financials.\n\nThe stock trades at a 20 P/E ratio and offers a 1.22% dividend yield. The P/E ratio is lower than most credit and debit card peers. American Express also has a higher yield than most of its competitors and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nAmerican Express got investors excited with impressive financial results in Q1 2024. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. That’s within the company’s range of 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026.\n\nThe fintech firm shined with net income surging by 34% year-over-year. Diluted EPS jumped by 39% year-over-year while American Express suggested a growth rate in the mid-teens beyond 2026. American Express is also experiencing heightened demand from younger generations. 60% of the company’s new cardholders are Gen Z or Millennial customers.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, SNPS, and AMZN.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has His Sights on Only 1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, and It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "When you look at the stock portfolios of most billionaire hedge fund managers, you'll find plenty of the Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as exposure to some of the most promising AI stocks. But that isn't the case in Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund's portfolio. In fact, despite having about $10 billion invested in the stock market, there are only seven different stocks in its latest SEC filings, and only one is a Magnificent Seven tech stock -- Google parent company Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nAs of the latest information, Pershing Square owns more than 13.7 million shares of Alphabet, with a total market value of $1.93 billion. This accounts for about 19% of Pershing's portfolio and makes it the hedge fund's largest investment.\n\nUnlike some of the other investments in Ackman's portfolio, he hasn't held Alphabet shares long, adding shares of both Class A and Class C shares to the portfolio in early 2023. Here's a closer look at Alphabet's business and why Ackman might be such a fan.\n\nAlphabet in a nutshell\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, which most people know for the Google search engine, as well as other tools like Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and Android. These, and a few other parts of the business, such as YouTube, make up the Google Services segment, which primarily makes its money by selling advertising on its various platforms.\n\nThe lesser-known part of the business (by most investors) is Google Cloud, the cloud services business. It's a competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, and is the number three cloud services provider, with a smaller share than either of those.\n\nThere are a few other components of Alphabet's business, but the two Google segments produce virtually all of its revenue.\n\nA tremendous combination of profitability and growth potential\n\nFirst off, Alphabet is a tremendously profitable business. It generated a net margin of 24% over the past four quarters and produced more than $88 billion in operating income in 2023 alone. The company also has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, and the combination of cash reserves and massive cash flow gives it excellent financial flexibility.\n\nSecond, Alphabet has a rare combination of a dominant business and massive growth potential. Many people reading this couldn't say what the number two search engine is without looking it up, and some of the other Google platforms are similarly dominant.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's ad revenue should grow significantly over time, especially as it leverages AI and other technologies to target advertisements at the right consumers and businesses more effectively. The Google Cloud side of the company in particular could have incredible growth potential. The global cloud computing market is expected to roughly quadruple in size by 2030, and Google Cloud could be a big beneficiary. In the most recent quarter, Google Cloud revenue grew by 26% year over year, and this level of growth could continue for many years to come.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAlphabet isn't exactly a cheap stock, trading for 28 times forward earnings estimates. But you get what you pay for in this case. Alphabet has the trifecta -- profitability, dominance, and growth potential -- and considering where it stands on all three of those, it looks attractively valued.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average appears to be getting left behind in the current bull market. Sure, the Dow is up over the last 12 months. However, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500 and the even higher-flying Nasdaq-100.\n\nSome Dow Jones Industrial Average members aren't likely to be left behind, though. These three Dow stocks are set to soar in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in the Dow. Its performance over the last 12 months has been worthy of the \"magnificent\" label, with shares skyrocketing close to 70%.\n\nWall Street thinks Amazon can keep up its winning ways. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 11%. I share analysts' optimism about Amazon.\n\nThe company's cost-cutting efforts are paying off. Amazon's earnings jumped to $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. I look for continued bottom-line momentum in the coming quarters.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon's long-term growth prospects remain strong. Advertising has become an important new growth driver. Amazon plans to launch its Project Kuiper satellites later this year to provide internet service from space. Artificial intelligence (AI) should provide a huge tailwind for Amazon Web Services' cloud platform.\n\n2. Intel\n\nUntil recent weeks, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) stood as one of the best-performing Dow stocks over the last 12 months. However, the giant chipmaker's massive losses in its foundry business revealed earlier this month dampened investors' enthusiasm.\n\nAnalysts still like Intel, though. The average 12-month price target for the stock is nearly 21% higher than the current share price. Although I'm unsure if Intel will hit that target over the next 12 months, I'm bullish about the stock overall.\n\nFor one thing, Intel expects its foundry business to be highly profitable by 2030. I believe the company's investment in manufacturing semiconductor chips for others is a smart long-term move.\n\nI also like Intel's AI prospects. Its new Gaudi 3 AI chip could take some data center market share away from Nvidia. Edge AI -- pushing AI processing to where data is generated -- should present another big opportunity for Intel over the next several years.\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) has done its part in lifting the Dow Jones. Shares of the software company are up 37% over the last 12 months. The stock had soared even higher but reports that Salesforce was in discussions to buy Informatica didn't make investors happy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAny potential deal in the works has since fallen apart. Wall Street hasn't been rattled by the uncertainty, though. The consensus 12-month price target for Salesforce reflects an upside potential of roughly 14%.\n\nSalesforce has been in a period of transformation -- a good one for the company. As CEO Marc Benioff said in the Q4 earnings call, \"[P]roductivity is up, profitability is up, margin's up, revenue is up.\"\n\nI expect Salesforce will continue to benefit from the explosion in adoption of AI. The company is seizing this opportunity, recently launching its Einstein 1 Studio. This new product enables Salesforce's users to customize the Einstein Copilot AI assistant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Since then, it has returned a staggering 6,326%, outpacing the broader markets by a wide margin. It means a $500 investment in MELI stock just after its IPO would be worth over $31,200 today.

But does this mean it’s too late to buy MELI stock now?\n\nWhile MercadoLibre will not be able to replicate its historical returns, I’m bullish on the stock due to its widening portfolio of solutions, earnings growth profile, and reasonable valuation.\n\nAn Overview of MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America based on the number of orders and unique visitors. A Brazil-based company, it has a presence in 17 other countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, Chile, and Peru. MercadoLibre is valued at $70.7 billion.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and caters to a region with more than 650 million people. Its fintech platform, MercadoPago, offers a diverse range of fintech products, such as debit cards, online payments, credit lines, savings, insurance, and investments.\n\nHow Did MercadoLibre Perform in Q4 of 2023?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment, MercadoLibre reported revenue of $4.26 billion in Q4 of 2023, an increase of 42% year-over-year. In fact the company’s top line grew at the fastest pace since Q3 of 2022. Its adjusted net income stood at $572 million, indicating a healthy margin of 13.2%.\n\nMercadoLibre reported gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $13.5 billion as growth in items sold rose to 29%, the highest in over two years. The e-commerce giant attributed its GMV growth to strong demand from Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\nThe expansion of its fulfillment network meant that MercadoLibre carried roughly 50% of its shipments in Q4 of 2023, a new record. It also delivered 122 million packages on the same or next day, an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nIn the Fintech business, MercadoLibre’s total payment volume, or TPV, touched $56.5 billion. It emphasized that off-platform TPV growth accelerated in key markets, growing by triple-digit rates. Moreover, it ended 2023 with a credit portfolio of $3.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year.\n\nA Focus on Consumer Electronics and AI\n\nMercadoLibre emphasized that the Consumer Electronics (CE) segment is its largest single online category in Latin America. To gain traction in this segment, it leverages technology to manage pricing, inventory, and supplier relationships. While MercadoLibre provides competitive offers in this category, it continues to grow margins in the Consumer Electronics vertical, allowing it to push harder for growth. For instance, during the Black Friday promotional campaign, the CE category grew by 140% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, MercadoLibre launched capabilities to enable sellers to create their own promotional coupons and answer buyers’ questions quickly due to its AI-powered platform. MercadoLibre also launched a new affiliates program and ramped up short-form videos to expand social media tools that drive traffic to seller listings.\n\nIts widening capabilities meant that MercadoLibre shipped 650 million items in 2023, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Further, the e-commerce giant believes investments in its fulfillment infrastructure should improve the value proposition for buyers and sellers.\n\nOnline Ads Will be a Key Revenue Driver\n\nSimilar to Amazon, MercadoLibre is well positioned to drive top-line growth due to digital ad sales, which is a high-margin business. Currently, Amazon is the third-largest digital ad platform in the world, after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn 2023, MercadoLibre relaunched its ads tech stack. It launched an automated buying platform for display ads while providing live reports and other insights to advertisers. Its tech stack for ads also includes a feature for agencies to manage multiple brands on the platform.\n\nFinally, the company launched Mercado Play, an ads-based streaming platform that operates on a revenue share model with studios. MercadoLibre is offering free content to users, as it unlocked a new revenue stream for the ads business.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for MELI Stock?\n\nOut of the 12 analyst ratings given to MELI stock, 10 are Buys, two are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MELI stock price target is $1,935.45, indicating upside potential of 41.3% from current levels.\n\nWall Street expects MercadoLibre to increase its revenue from $14.47 billion in 2023 to $17.7 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $19.46 per share in 2023 to $32.98 per share in 2024. So, priced at 41.5 times forward earnings, MELI stock might seem expensive, given that the sector median multiple is much lower at 14.9x. However, MELI is on track to grow the bottom line by 72.5% this year, so it deserves a premium valuation.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMercadoLibre’s expanding portfolio of products enables the company to unlock additional revenue streams while contributing to earnings growth. Its broadening base of customers and robust ecosystem of online solutions position the firm to benefit from secular growth trends in the upcoming decade. Basically, MELI is a fast-growing large-cap stock that looks poised to beat the broader markets in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Repeats story for wider audience. No changes to text.)\n\nBy Aditya Kalra and Kanjyik Ghosh\n\nApril 25 (Reuters) - JioCinema, the streaming platform run by India's Reliance Industries, on Thursday cut prices of its premium offering to as low as 29 rupees ($0.3480) a month, heating up competition for Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\nReliance runs multiple TV channels and JioCinema streaming app through its media unit Viacom18 and has a sizeable hold over India's $28-billion media and entertainment market.\n\nAn advertisement-free version would start at an introductory price of 29 rupees per month for streaming on a single device and go up to 89 rupees for a \"Family\" plan to stream on four simultaneous devices, JioCinema said in a statement.\n\nThe platform previously priced its premium offering at 99 rupees ($1.19) a month, or 999 rupees a year, for streaming on up to four devices simultaneously. The plan was not ad-free.\n\nExisting JioCinema premium members will get all the additional benefits of the \"Family\" plan at no extra cost, it said.\n\nJioCinema has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament for free. The new pricing, it said, is only for premium content, while the matches and many other shows would continue to stream for free.\n\nMukesh Ambani, who runs India's top conglomerate Reliance Industries, has a reputation of disrupting rivals in the price-sensitive Indian market with cheap offers.\n\nLower prices would place JioCinema in a stronger footing to compete with Netflix and Amazon after an agreement with Disney to merge India TV and streaming assets, and content deals with the likes of Warner Bros Discovery and NBCUniversal.\n\nJioCinema hosts popular titles such as \"Succession\" and shows featuring the character Harry Potter, alongside a variety of offerings targeting kids including popular Japanese anime series, Pokemon.\n\n($1 = 83.3367 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Kanjyik Ghosh; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel and Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court revived a lawsuit accusing Whole Foods of illegally firing a worker who refused to remove her \"Black Lives Matter\" facemask and complained about racism at the upscale grocery chain.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision released on Wednesday, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the firing of Savannah Kinzer, an outspoken critic who worked in a Cambridge, Massachusetts, store, \"arguably deviated\" from Whole Foods' disciplinary process.\n\nThe Boston-based panel also upheld the dismissal of similar claims by two other workers, Haley Evans and Christopher Michno, finding no proof that Whole Foods' discipline of them was unusual. Whole Foods is owned by Amazon.com.\n\nNeither Whole Foods nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of many arising from protests that followed the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nIt began as a proposed class action over a Whole Foods dress code that barred workers from wearing Black Lives Matter attire.\n\nWhole Foods has long maintained that its dress code, which also covered visible slogans, logos and ads, was meant to foster a welcoming, safe and inclusive shopping environment. The appeals court dismissed the class action claims in 2022.\n\nKinzer said she was fired in retaliation for \"protected conduct\" including protesting outside her store, rejecting demands to stop wearing a mask, talking to the press, and filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nWhole Foods said Kinzer's poor attendance, including \"attendance points\" for wearing a mask, justified her firing.\n\nCircuit Judge Kermit Lipez, however, said it was unclear whether Whole Foods imposed a final, decisive attendance point against Kinzer through a normal application of its time and attendance policy, or because of her protected conduct.\n\n\"It is the province of a jury to decide such a dispute,\" he wrote.\n\nThe appeals court returned Kinzer's case to U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston, who dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims in January 2023.\n\nWhole Foods employed Evans in Marlton, New Jersey, and Michno in Berkeley, California.\n\nThe case is Kinzer et al v Whole Foods Market Inc, 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 22-1064, 23-1100.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "China's Temu Takes Over 17% Of US Market Share, Cutting Jobs From American Amazon And Decimating Small Businesses\n\nWith rising inflation, American consumers are increasingly turning to the Chinese e-commerce platform Temu for their shopping needs. With its enticing tagline “Shop like a billionaire,” Temu has captured 17% of the U.S. market share, posing a challenge to traditional American retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Dollar Tree Inc. and Five Below Inc. The rise highlights the lucrative and disruptive nature of startups.\n\nOwned and operated by PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), Temu offers a wide range of products, including home decor, pet supplies, beauty and health products and clothing. The platform is known for its competitive pricing, often offering significant discounts on items compared to prices on Amazon. Coupled with Temu’s discount codes, consumers can enjoy even greater savings.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nJoin the elite. Invest in Epic Games and own a piece of the $17 billion Fortnite empire. This ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.\n\nTemu has even become the No. 1 Shopping App on Apple’s App Store, surpassing Amazon, Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., which currently hold the third, fourth and eighth spots, respectively. The No. 2 shopping app is Shein, another Chinese retailer.\n\nOrders purchased on Temu are shipped from China and are estimated to be delivered within 10 days. However, in a bid to compete with Amazon’s fast delivery, Temu opened its marketplace to U.S. warehouses last month. Shopping from these sellers can significantly reduce shipping time, giving U.S. retailers the ability to handle fulfillment and shipping directly.\n\nTrending: Invest alongside execs from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\n\nIn December, Reuters reported that Temu was successfully challenging U.S. dollar stores like Dollar Tree and Dollar General Corp., accounting for nearly 17% of the market share in the United States. According to data analytics firm Earnest Analytics, this compares to 8% for Five Below, 43% for Dollar General and 28% for Dollar Tree.\n\nIn January, Amazon announced it would lay off 5% of its Buy with Prime workforce, which equips retailers with fulfillment and delivery services.\n\n\"Following a recent review, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles on our Buy with Prime team.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra and Kanjyik Ghosh\n\nApril 25 (Reuters) - JioCinema, the streaming platform run by India's Reliance Industries, on Thursday cut prices of its premium offering to as low as 29 rupees ($0.3480) a month, heating up competition for Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\nReliance runs multiple TV channels and JioCinema streaming app through its media unit Viacom18 and has a sizeable hold over India's $28-billion media and entertainment market.\n\nAn advertisement-free version would start at an introductory price of 29 rupees per month for streaming on a single device and go up to 89 rupees for a \"Family\" plan to stream on four simultaneous devices, JioCinema said in a statement.\n\nThe platform previously priced its premium offering at 99 rupees ($1.19) a month, or 999 rupees a year, for streaming on up to four devices simultaneously. The plan was not ad-free.\n\nExisting JioCinema premium members will get all the additional benefits of the \"Family\" plan at no extra cost, it said.\n\nJioCinema has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament for free. The new pricing, it said, is only for premium content, while the matches and many other shows would continue to stream for free.\n\nMukesh Ambani, who runs India's top conglomerate Reliance Industries, has a reputation of disrupting rivals in the price-sensitive Indian market with cheap offers.\n\nLower prices would place JioCinema in a stronger footing to compete with Netflix and Amazon after an agreement with Disney to merge India TV and streaming assets, and content deals with the likes of Warner Bros Discovery and NBCUniversal.\n\nJioCinema hosts popular titles such as \"Succession\" and shows featuring the character Harry Potter, alongside a variety of offerings targeting kids including popular Japanese anime series, Pokemon.\n\n($1 = 83.3367 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Kanjyik Ghosh; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hawaiian Airlines slowly adds freighters for Amazon business",
        "content": "Amazon predominantly operates Boeing 767 converted freighters but is beginning to phase in larger Airbus A330 aircraft in its domestic air network. (Photo: Shutterstock/RDNichols)\n\nHawaiian Airlines has commenced operating a second Airbus A330-300 cargo jet for Amazon on a new route between New York’s JFK airport and the retail behemoth’s West Coast air logistics hub in San Bernardino, California, the company reported in quarterly earnings Tuesday.\n\nUnder a  transportation services agreement that kicked in last year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) leases the aircraft from a dealer and transfers them to Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA) to fly and provide routine maintenance. Hawaiian, which is branching out to all-cargo operations for the first time, began commercial revenue service for Amazon in early October on a route connecting San Bernardino with Amazon Air’s superhub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG).\n\nAmazon plans to acquire 10 A330 converted freighters as replacements for aging Boeing 767-200s operated by other partner airlines. The original schedule called for Hawaiian Airlines to receive eight more freighters this year, but the airline said delivery flow is behind by two aircraft because the airframe repair company responsible for reconfiguring the used passenger jets to carry heavy containers is experiencing production delays. That means Hawaiian will have seven aircraft, instead of nine, in possession by the end of the year, if the current schedule remains intact.\n\nCEO Peter Ingram said Hawaiian may postpone deploying some cargo aircraft that join the fleet this year in order not to add complexity to Amazon’s network during the busiest shipping period.\n\n“I would caution that they may not all be flying by the end of the year because during the peak period our partner doesn’t necessarily want to introduce new lines of flying into the operation,” he said on an earnings briefing with analysts.\n\nAmazon has been operating Boeing 767s between New York-San Bernardino, according to a route map compiled by a team of researchers at DePaul University. Their most recent report, in March, found that Amazon is streamlining its airport network, slowing fleet growth and utilizing larger aircraft like the A330 to improve efficiency.\n\nIndustry experts say the best use of the A330, from the standpoint of minimizing operating costs, is on the longest routes in Amazon’s network.\n\nAmazon has always been willing to overfly the CVG hub if aircraft have high load factors, said Derek Lossing, founder of e-commerce logistics consultancy Cirrus Global Advisors and a former senior manager at Amazon Logistics.\n\n“The hub is great for when you have to put multiple destinations on a flight to fill it up. But if there is enough New York to Los Angeles volumes, doing a sort at the hub just costs time and extra flying. So if you can fill up aircraft on point to point routes, and they are full or almost full, you actually prefer to avoid the hub,” he explained by email.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the first quarter, Hawaiian Airlines recorded an adjusted loss of $143.5 million despite a 5.4% increase in revenue to $646 million that benefited from increased system capacity. The operating loss increased 26% year over year as expense growth exceeded revenues.  Unit costs increased about 7% year over year, including a point attributed to the Amazon flying. Losses were also higher because of how the company’s lower effective tax rate was booked.\n\nHigh lodging rates in Hawaii and the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen have contributed to low travel demand from Japan, a key market. The wildfire that destroyed Maui last year has also been a drag on business.\n\nOn the bright side, Hawaiian expects all its Airbus A321neos back in service within a few weeks after several were sidelined because of problems with Pratt & Whitney engines that required extensive inspections. More than 1,000 P&W engines have been recalled across the industry.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says\n\nThe post Hawaiian Airlines slowly adds freighters for Amazon business appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as Wall Street continues to look for signs that the AI explosion is more than just hype. In its prior quarter, Microsoft announced that its AI capabilities contributed 6 percentage points of growth to the company’s Azure revenue, up from 3% in the previous period, and analysts are looking for more.\n\nShares of Microsoft are up more than 10% year to date, behind rivals such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), which are up 15% and 22%, respectively. Over the last 12 months, Microsoft’s shares have climbed 32%, though Amazon has jumped 67%, while Google is up 47%.\n\nThe three companies are battling it out to see which can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions to enterprise customers and customers, whether that means making heavy investments in third-party firms like OpenAI and Anthropic or reorganizing their internal teams like Google. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a keynote address at CES 2024. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is calling for Microsoft to report earnings per share of $2.83 on revenue of $60.88 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In the same period last year, Microsoft reported EPS of $2.45 on revenue of $52.86 billion.\n\nAnalysts are looking for Microsoft to announce overall commercial cloud revenue of $33.93 billion in the quarter, a 19% year-over-year increase. In terms of business segments, Wall Street anticipates Microsoft will report Productivity and Business Processes revenue of $19.54 billion, Intelligent cloud revenue of $26.25 billion, and More Personal Computing revenue of $15.07 billion.\n\nMicrosoft’s AI ambitions got a healthy boost on Tuesday when it announced that Coca-Cola (KO) signed a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement to use the software giant’s Azure cloud services and AI technology.\n\n“Through our long-term partnership, we have made significant progress to accelerate system-wide AI transformation across The Coca-Cola Company and its network of independent bottlers worldwide,” Microsoft executive vice president and chief commercial officer Judson Althoff said in a statement.

(Yahoo Finance)\n\nMicrosoft has unleashed a torrent of new AI features and services for its enterprise and productivity apps and consumer platforms ever since it first debuted its revamped version of Bing and its AI chatbot in February 2023.\n\nIn March, Microsoft announced that it hired DeepMind AI and Inflection AI co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, fellow Inflection AI co-founder Karén Simonyan, as well as a number of the company’s staff members. Suleyman is taking up a new post at Microsoft as CEO of the Microsoft AI division.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, Microsoft announced a multiyear partnership with French AI startup Mistral that would allow Microsoft to offer the company’s models on its Azure platform.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of growth stocks and how they relate to the current stock market environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.\n\nAs the first quarter of 2024 is behind us, the stock market is also presenting a changed environment. The first quarter saw an extension of the themes that were in play during Q4 2023. It saw artificial intelligence and technology stocks continue to post gains, as investors were not only convinced that AI held great potential when it came to consumer and business use cases, but also that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates multiple times this year.\n\nHowever, with Q2 now officially underway, investor expectations for a robust economic environment to pile vast sums of money into the stock market have now shifted. Part of this is due to fresh economic data that shows that despite the fact that it is significantly down from the highs of 2022, inflation is still higher than what the Federal Reserve would like to observe. Consequently, major stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite have dialed down some of their gains as Wall Street starts to enter a 'wait and watch' phase.\n\nFor instance, while the S&P 500 made news in 2024 for crossing the 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history, it ended up losing more than 4% of these gains during the second and third week of April 2024 after the inflation data for March 2024 was released. Similarly, the tech heavy NASDAQ Comp fell by 7% during the same time period and recovered some of these gains later on.\n\nHow does this relate to growth stocks? Well, the macroeconomic factors that have contributed to the illustrious stock indexes shedding their gains are also ones that do not bode well for growth stocks. One of the most commonly accepted definitions of a growth stock is a firm whose price bakes in a significant premium over the earnings per share. This premium is measured through the price to earnings ratio, which is also evaluated along with the industry average to see whether the high multiple is an industry trend or an exception.\n\nGrowth stocks are also some of the most highly sought ones on Wall Street since investing for most people is all about making money by watching share prices grow. Some of the best known growth stocks of our times have transformed industries and made history in their respective industries. Two such examples are the semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). AMD's shares are up by a whopping 445% over the past five years, showing that those investors with the correct insights about the semiconductor industry who had the foresight to buy the shares in 2019 would be significantly better off now. So why have AMD's shares soared? The answer to this question lies in the nature of the semiconductor industry and the prowess of the firm's CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The nature of the chip sector means that not every company can sell x86 microprocessors. In fact, most such processors are made by the chip behemoth Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and AMD's success has been due to its ability to capture market share from the larger rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has soared because it became the first company in the world to make and ship electric vehicles on scale. Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund:\n\nTesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth.\n\nSo, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more: 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\nA close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top growth stocks, we ranked the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023.

Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "Amazon is looking to expand its grocery delivery business.\n\nThe online retailer has announced a new monthly subscription program that will offer (kinda) free delivery of grocery orders over $35 within an hour, where available. Prime Members can sign up for $10 per month. (Prime subscribers previously paid $6.95 for orders of $50 to $100 and $9.95 for those under $50.)\n\nNon-Prime members who have an EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) card can get the same benefits for $5 per month—with a 30-day free trial.\n\nA trial version of this program launched last year in three cities, but with this announcement, Amazon is expanding the service to more than 3,500 cities across the U.S. Beyond Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, members can get deliveries from a variety of local grocery and specialty retailers, along with unlimited delivery on orders of $35 or more from Cardenas Markets, Save Mart, Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid, Pet Food Express, and Mission Wine & Spirits.\n\nPrefer to get your groceries in person? Subscribers can pick up orders within 30 minutes, regardless of the size of their order—and receive priority access to the company’s Recurring Reservations for weekly grocery orders.\n\nPrime customers will continue to receive discounts both in-store or online, regardless of whether they sign up for the delivery subscription.\n\nAmazon bought Whole Foods in 2017.\n\nAmazon has been increasingly adding side subscription options for its Prime members. Last year, it added commercials to its Prime Video program, instituting a $3 per month surcharge to do away with those.\n\nThese add-ons have helped the company keep the price of a Prime membership relatively stable. The company last increased the cost of a Prime membership in early 2022, raising it to $139 per year.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Elon Musk's Big Bet: Tesla to Ramp Up AI Development with Nvidia's Powerful Chips\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may install 85,000 Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 chips by year-end to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nIf CEO Elon Musk proceeds with this plan, Tesla will surpass tech giants like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a significant Nvidia customer.\n\nDuring Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report for 2024, Musk disclosed that the company currently possesses 35,000 H100 chips, the most advanced and expensive graphics processing units designed for AI applications, CNBC reports.\n\nThese chips are vital for Musk’s AI initiatives, which include the development of advanced robots like Optimus Bot and Robotaxi and a supercomputer named Dojo.\n\nReports indicate that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is Nvidia’s largest customer.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Nvidia produced 550,000 chips last year, and companies must wait until 2024 to secure additional supplies.\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest buyer, as stated by Omdia, with an order of 150,000 GPUs in 2023. Other significant purchasers include Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Google, and Amazon, each reportedly acquiring 50,000 chips. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon nearly account for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. CNBC writes.\n\nMusk had mocked Nvidia’s substantial market capitalization loss on April 19, calling the 10% stock decline “rookie numbers” on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNvidia experienced a significant drop in stock value, shedding $211 billion in market capitalization, marking the second-largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThis steep decline was triggered by disappointing earnings from ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and a pessimistic market outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nMeanwhile, analysts maintained their bullish stance on Nvidia, expecting it to rule the accelerator market primarily backed by its Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 205% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "Amazon to Open More Cloud Centers in Southeast Asia for Better Data Protection\n\nAmazon.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is establishing cloud regions in Southeast Asia in response to customer demands for secure local data storage.\n\n“The reason for this is that many of our customers have been asking for that. They really wanted something local such that they can meet, for example, local data storage requirements, or protection of personal identifiable information,” CNBC cites from Amazon’s Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels’ interview.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing division, led the global cloud service market in the fourth quarter, capturing 31% of total cloud spending, says a Canalys report according to CNBC.\n\nAn AWS region consists of a physical location with clusters of data centers. Each area contains at least three separate availability zones, each equipped with power, cooling, and physical security and connected by redundant, ultra-low-latency networks.\n\nVogels noted that startups, large enterprises, and government agencies seek local technological deployments.\n\nIn November, Amazon announced the launch of a new AWS Region in Malaysia and committed to investing 25.5 billion Malaysian ringgit ($6 billion) by 2037. This investment supports the Malaysian government’s goal of transforming the country into a high-income digital economy by 2030.\n\nFollowing the opening of cloud regions in Indonesia in December 2021 and Singapore in 2010, AWS plans to introduce an infrastructure region in Thailand.\n\nAWS already operates multiple regions across various global locations, including North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nAnalysts have flagged Amazon’s leading position in generative AI, predicting significant advantages from its development of AI chips and diverse large language model offerings.\n\nFor AWS, a quarter-over-quarter growth of $545 million and a 16% year-over-year increase are likely slightly ahead of the market’s 15% expectation.\n\nThey highlighted potential growth from AWS, advertising, and outperformance in the retail segment, with AWS expected to achieve a 16% year-over-year increase, slightly surpassing market expectations. Analysts also remain optimistic about Amazon’s eCommerce growth, supported by increased U.S. online spending and new developments like Prime Video ads and AI enhancements at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference.\n\nAmazon stock gained over 69% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Consumer Discretionary (NYSE:XLY) and Vanguard Consumer Discretion ETF (NYSE:VCR).\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: AMZN shares traded higher by 0.43% at $180.31 premarket on the last check Wednesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon to Open More Cloud Centers in Southeast Asia for Better Data Protection originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Carvana (CVNA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects Carvana (CVNA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +49%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.69 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Carvana?\n\nFor Carvana, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +39.17%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Carvana will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Carvana would post a loss of $0.95 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1, delivering a surprise of -5.26%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nCarvana appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Amazon (AMZN), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +164.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $142.53 billion, up 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Amazon has been revised 1.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 6.19%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, PDD Holdings and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, PDD Holdings Inc. PDD and Apple Inc's AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nMagnificent Meta a Compelling Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAfter a dismal 2022, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms, Inc. made a terrific comeback last year. Meta Platforms delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and joined the trillion-dollar market capitalization at the onset of 2024.\n\nA rebound in Meta Platforms' flagship ad business and its cost-cutting initiatives further bolstered expectations for bullish first-quarter 2024 earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 24, after market close.\n\nMeta Platforms is estimated to report earnings per share of $4.32 for the first three months of 2024, more than $2.64 a year ago, representing a jump of 63.6%. Moreover, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement.\n\nMeta Platforms' shares, rightfully, soared around 37% in the first quarter. However, its shares are trading in the negative territory in April, more or less matching the broader market. Skeptics doubt Meta Platforms' big spending goal on generative AI and the Metaverse as it may impact the company's financials.\n\nYet, Meta Platforms' current hiccup is momentary. Instead, the company remains a market darling. This is because Meta Platforms' digital advertising business is gaining strength from e-commerce firms in China.\n\nDiscount shopping app, Temu has given stiff competition to Amazon.com, Inc. in China as it racked up solid sales in the past year. Now, PDD Holdings Inc., Temu's parent company has extensively used Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook platforms with ads for Temu, something that bodes well for the social media behemoth.\n\nInterestingly, Meta Platforms is currently teaming up with Amazon. Links will be provided on the Instagram and Facebook platforms for users to purchase goods from Amazon. This initiative will boost Meta Platforms' ad revenues as well as improve transaction growth for Amazon. What's more, competing rivals could further strike similar deals with Meta Platforms, a tailwind for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives' inclination toward banning TikTok from operating in the United States should stand in good stead for Meta Platforms. TikTok is suspected of becoming a security threat as it influences public opinion in the United States. Nonetheless, banning TikTok will compel its audience to shift toward Instagram reels, and advertisements will follow.\n\nStory continues\n\nStatista, meanwhile, reported that the AI market is expected to see a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 and 2030. Meta Platforms, thus, has joined the AI frenzy, which should help its shares gain traction. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg recently launched the Meta.ai chatbot. Meta Platforms has also launched an updated AI chip to enhance its data centers.\n\nMeta Platforms' bet on Metaverse somehow didn't look good for the company. Its Reality Labs division has been incurring losses for quite some time. But lately, with the launch of Quest 3, Meta Platforms' VR headset, sales from the Reality Labs division are poised to improve. Lest we forget, Mark Zuckerberg has already downplayed the threat from Apple Inc's Vision Pro headset.\n\nThe current year is also the 'Year of Efficiency' for Meta Platforms. The company has slashed umpteen jobs to streamline its operation. Such cost-cutting measures will help the company mitigate macroeconomic headwinds, apprehensions of a recession and higher interest rates. The company, anyhow, is cash-rich making it unperturbed to market upheavals. Meta Platforms' cash and cash equivalents were $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, up from $61.12 billion on Sep 30, 2023.\n\nTo top it, the net profit margin of Meta Platforms is nearly 29%, way higher than the 20% mark, indicating a high margin. In other words, the company has kept its operating expenses under check and is worthy of generating the necessary profit from sales. In reality, Meta Platforms have been efficiently generating profits since it has a return on equity of 29.5%, which is typically considered good.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms enjoy an economic moat. Almost half of social media platform handlers globally are using Meta Platforms' applications. This diversification and huge audience base protect the company from any downside risk.\n\nThe social media giant also began paying dividends recently, and a passive income surely shouldn't bother any razor-sharp investor. Meta Platforms' annual dividend yield is 0.42%, which is less, but the company is just starting. Thus, Meta Platforms' shares have more upside left in the near future and is currently a compelling buy.\n\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 35.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next years is 18.2% and 12.8%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta Platforms' current-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. Meta Platforms currently possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Microsoft's AI lead puts Amazon cloud dominance on watch",
        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Upcoming quarterly reports from U.S. tech giants may show Microsoft is closing the gap on cloud-computing market leader Amazon.com as more businesses switch to its services, attracted by a clutch of generative AI features that are powered by OpenAI's technology.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant has beaten rivals Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet to the market with AI services including the Copilot, a set of genAI tools that work in Microsoft's business apps, that was rolled out in November for $30 a month.\n\nIts earnings on Thursday will be an indicator of AI adoption and could influence the movement of technology stocks as a rally in the sector eases this month amid worries that interest rates in the U.S. could stay high for longer.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft - which overtook Apple as the world's most valuable firm earlier this year - to report that the billions of dollars it has invested in generative AI were attracting clients to its Azure cloud-computing service.\n\n\"Azure is benefiting from a halo effect around Microsoft's AI strategy,\" said RBC Capital Markets Rishi Jaluria, who expects Microsoft to take Amazon's market share.\n\nJaluria added that cloud providers should broadly benefit from signs of stabilization in technology spending, which has been pressured by high-interest rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nIn the first three months of 2024, Microsoft's revenue is expected to have grown 15% and Alphabet's 12.6% - their second-highest rate in nearly two years. Amazon's revenue could rise 11.9%, its worst in three quarters.\n\nAzure, part of the Intelligent cloud unit at Microsoft, is expected to have grown 28.9% in the January-to-March period, according to estimates from Visible Alpha.\n\nThat compares with estimated growth of 14.9% for Amazon Web Service and 25% for Google Cloud, the third-largest cloud provider, according to LSEG data. Google-parent Alphabet reports earnings on Thursday and Amazon on April 30.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino estimated that up to 8 percentage points of Azure's growth could come from AI services.\n\nStill, much of the boost from AI is expected to be realized from next year, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating a $5 billion revenue contribution from Copilot in Microsoft's fiscal 2025, which would start in July.\n\n\"Broader elements of generative AI story (like 365 Copilot) likely need more time to develop and work through enterprise purchasing cycles,\" Morgan Stanley said earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGLE AI GAINS TO TAKE LONGER\n\nWhile Alphabet shares have gained over 13% so far this year and recently scaled a record high on optimism over its AI efforts including the Gemini models, several analysts said the company was not rushing to monetize the technology and that it may take longer for Google Cloud to benefit from AI integration.\n\nGoogle offers a slew of AI features within Workspace productivity apps, which are powered by its large language model Gemini, for up to $30 per user per month. Earlier this month, it announced two $10 add-on packages for AI meeting notes and summaries, and for added security features.\n\n\"Our checks at Google Cloud Next conference showed high interest levels and abundant innovation, but no rush to turn AI pilots into production apps,\" said analysts at Jefferies, who see a more meaningful boost in 2025.\n\nAmazon has not announced any major AI moves but is weaving the technology into AWS on the back of its $4 billion investment in OpenAI-competitor Anthropic.\n\n\"Microsoft has gained a lot of ground last year based on its AI prominence, but AWS is still a much bigger business and we expect Amazon to catch up to those capabilities over the next couple of years,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alibaba’s Risky Gamble: Can the E-Commerce Titan Bounce Back from Its Missteps?",
        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is an example of a stock that took its eye off the ball and struck out big. Now it is scrambling to regain its footing. Alibaba’s ongoing restructuring has failed to win over the market, resulting in a 9% year-to-date decline in its stock, a 22% decline over the last 12 months, and a more than 31% drop from its 52-week high.\n\nAlthough founder Jack Ma endorsed the Chinese online retailer’s turnaround plans, investors might not want to rush in. Alibaba is a behemoth. Righting the ship is going to take time.\n\nA Closer Look at Alibaba Stock\n\nTrying to be all things to all people doesn’t always pan out, especially under China’s political system. It’s the problem of trying to run a capitalist business in a communist economy. The two are often at odds and the government doesn’t like to be shown up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba ran into that during the pandemic when Ma criticized regulators for stifling innovation. They came after the e-commerce giant hard. Ma was called before the regulators, an anti-monopoly probe was launched into Alibaba, and Ma’s Ant Financial had its much-anticipated IPO scrapped. Ma went into hiding.\n\nOthers found out the hard way as well. Chinese property developer Ren Zhiqiang made the mistake of referring to President Xi Jinping as a “clown.” He ended up being charged and convicted of corruption before getting sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nYou’re always operating with one eye looking over your shoulder. That may have been what kept Alibaba from seeing the competition coming.\n\nJuggling Too Many Plates\n\nAlibaba has its fingers in a lot of pies. It has replicated the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recipe of offering logistics services, local consumer services, digital media and entertainment.\n\nThere is also Alibaba Health, an on and offline healthcare products and services business; Alibaba Cloud, its cloud computing division; and Global Digital Commerce, where it operates marketplaces like Lazada and Aliexpress in various international markets.\n\nThese far-flung businesses require a lot of time and attention that Alibaba apparently couldn’t spare. Its primary e-commerce operations fell behind PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), which runs Temu and Pinduoduo. PDD took from Alibaba the title of China’s most valuable online-retail company.\n\nByteDance‘s Douyin video platform is transforming into a viable e-commerce platform and is growing faster than either Alibaba or JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Alibaba Cloud is the online retailer’s second biggest revenue source, but suffered outages at the end of 2022 that affected large swaths of the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba attempted to spin off a number of its units into standalone businesses, but most of those ended up getting canceled. Most recently it scrapped its logistics business IPO due to unfavorable market conditions.\n\nA New Direction\n\nThe e-commerce giant now has a new CEO, Eddie Wu, who will direct Alibaba’s focus back to its bread-and-butter operations. It is focusing on offering consumers low prices again and will use its market-leading position in artificial intelligence to improve offerings throughout all of its businesses.\n\nIt was this restructuring that Ma endorsed. He said it was important for Alibaba stock for the company to admit the mistakes it had made in the past, but to also move past them for the future.\n\n“This year, amid the many doubts and pressures on the company internally and externally, I saw the birth of a strong and brave Alibaba team,” Ma wrote to company employees.\n\nThose doubts and pressures still exist. Admitting there is a problem is only the first step towards redemption. Alibaba still needs to pull it off. Until it shows concrete results, investors should not full embrace the retailer’s stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Adds Amazon comment)\n\nMILAN, April 24 (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust authority has fined two subsidiaries of Amazon a total of 10 million euros ($10.7 million) for alleged unfair commercial practices, the regulator said on Wednesday, a decision the U.S. e-commerce giant said it would appeal.\n\nAmazon \"significantly restricted consumers' freedom of choice\" by automatically pre-setting a 'Subscribe and Save' option on its website for a wide selection of products, the watchdog said.\n\nIn this way consumers were more likely to opt for regular scheduled deliveries rather than one-off purchases. \"The pre-ticking of recurring purchase induces one to periodically buy a product - even without the effective need - thus limiting one's freedom of choice,\" the authority said in a statement.\n\nAmazon contested the decision and said it would appeal.\n\n\"Every day customers benefit from the Subscribe and Save program by saving money and time on regular deliveries of items they routinely use\", it said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe 'Subscribe and Save' option, which allows customers to schedule periodic deliveries of everyday essentials with an extra discount against the price of a single purchase, has allowed savings of more than 40 million euros ($43 million) since its launch in Italy, the company added.\n\n($1 = 0.9350 euros) (Reporting by Gianluca Semeraro and Matteo Negri; Editing by Gavin Jones and Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Selling",
        "content": "Within the last month, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh highs. While there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors and industries, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been widely credited with lifting these major stock indexes to record levels.\n\nPut simply, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded businesses in the country. These seven juggernauts are (listed in descending order by market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll seven of these companies have crushed the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade. This outperformance is a big reason why investors -- and members of Congress -- have flocked to these businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (and members of Congress) have historically flocked to the Magnificent Seven\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven are leaders or critical players in their respective industries:\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the undisputed leader in global desktop operating systems, while Azure is No. 2 in worldwide cloud infrastructure service spend. Apple's iPhone accounts for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share. Alphabet's Google was responsible for a 91% share of global internet search in March, while wholly owned streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) make up a 90% (or greater) share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is No. 1 globally in online retail market share. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services is the worldwide No. 1 in cloud infrastructure service spend. Meta Platforms owns the most sought-after social media real estate, with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and its other apps collectively attracting almost 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs), and is the only pure-play EV maker to have achieved recurring profits.\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive advantages, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales shows that select lawmakers on Capitol Hill have sent three Magnificent Seven stocks to the chopping block.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 Congress is selling: Nvidia\n\nAlthough Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband have made a small fortune purchasing call options in the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, when it comes to the purchasing and selling of common shares, members of Congress were decidedly sellers of Nvidia stock in 2023. Collectively, $1.76 million shares were sold by lawmakers last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest seller of all, according to data from Capitol Trades, has been House Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA). Between May 5, 2023 and Aug. 14, 2023, five sell orders were executed for Meuser, ranging from just $1,000 to $15,000, up to a sell order of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are three key reasons shares of Nvidia may be headed notably lower.\n\nTo start with, every next-big-thing investment trend since the advent of the internet 30 years ago has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and adoption of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nSecondly, Nvidia has the potential to cannibalize its own pricing power in the coming quarters. The scarcity of its in-demand GPUs drove the price of its A100 and H100 chips into the stratosphere last year. As Nvidia brings more production to market, and new competitors enter the space, GPU scarcity will decline. In turn, Nvidia's gross margin should retrace.\n\nThe third issue, which I believe is Nvidia's biggest hurdle, is that its top four customers (Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet) are all developing in-house GPUs of their own. These Magnificent Seven components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales, and we're probably witnessing a peak in orders from these industry titans. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 Congress is selling: Microsoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress have been steady sellers of is the largest publicly traded company, Microsoft. Though Microsoft is listed on Unusual Whales' heatmap as one of the most-purchased stocks in 2023 ($1.97 million shares bought by lawmakers), members of Congress collectively sold $11.61 million shares. That's a net of $9.64 million worth of Microsoft shares that were sold last year.\n\nWhereas Nvidia had one notable seller, a number of lawmakers couldn't stop selling shares of Microsoft:\n\nHouse Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) dumped between $1 million and $5 million in shares on Jan. 4, 2023. House Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) sold between $250,000 and $500,000 in shares on both March 1, 2023 and Aug. 30, 2023. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) shed $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Microsoft stock on June 20, 2023. House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) sold multiple rounds of Microsoft stock that commonly ranged between five-and-six figures throughout 2023.\n\nThe likeliest reason for this selling is simple profit-taking. Shares of the company gained 57% last year, with the company's investments in AI fueling its ascent.\n\nAnother reason lawmakers may have headed for the exit is Microsoft's valuation. Although Microsoft is an absolute cash cow, it ended April 19 at a multiple of nearly 32 times forward-year earnings. For some context, this is about a 10% premium to Microsoft's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, members of Congress might be concerned about a bubble brewing in the AI space. Microsoft has aggressively invested in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has been incorporating generative AI solutions into Azure. If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, some of Microsoft's valuation premium may be wiped away.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock No. 3 Congress is selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress can't stop selling is social media maven Meta Platforms. Though Meta doesn't appear on Unusual Whales' heatmap of congressional buying activity, it was one of the most-actively sold communication services providers in 2023, with aggregate selling of $2.6 million.\n\nThe culprit for the lion's share of this selling activity in Meta is Michael McCaul, Congress' second most-active stock trader (1,826 trades completed in 2023). In addition to dumping shares of Microsoft on numerous occasions, McCaul sold shares of Meta 16 times last year, based on data provided by Capitol Trades.\n\nAs with Nvidia and Microsoft, profit-taking is a logical reason why lawmakers headed for the exit in 2023. Meta was one of the top-performing megacap stocks last year, with its AI ties clearly providing a boost.\n\nAnother catalyst that may have encouraged members of Congress to pare down their stakes in Meta is the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession. Select predictive indicators and money-based metrics suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy may not be far off. Meta generated close to 98% of its revenue from advertising in 2023, and businesses aren't shy about reducing their ad spending when trouble arises. Although recessions are short-lived, they could hit Meta harder than other Magnificent Seven components.\n\nThe final factor that may be behind Congress' selling of Meta stock is the increasingly competitive social media landscape. The continued popularity of TikTok serves as formidable competition and could result in weaker ad-pricing power for Facebook, the top social media platform in the world.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe McCaul has made a big mistake parting with his shares of Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Bull Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is 16 months into a bull market and the index has already soared 53%, but history says it could move much higher in the next couple years. The Nasdaq returned an average of 215% during the eight bull markets since 1990, and it realized those gains over an average of 40 months.\n\nIf the current bull market aligns with that average, the Nasdaq will gain another 162% during the next two years. That implies annual returns above 60%, which is highly unlikely given the economic uncertainty. But whichever direction the wind blows in the near term, history says the index is headed much higher in the long term. The Nasdaq returned 15% annually over the last decade and similar results are likely during the next decade.\n\nInvestors hoping to capitalize on that momentum should buy a few shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). Here's why.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three major markets -- e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud services -- and the company is gaining share in two of them. Specifically, it accounted for 39.6% of online retail sales in the United States last year, up 130 basis points (1.3 percentage points) from the prior year. It also accounted for 7.6% of global digital ad spending, up 80 basis points. That makes Amazon the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. and the third largest digital advertising company worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 31% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, down two points from the previous year. However, AWS still leads the market, outranking second-place Microsoft Azure by seven points, according to Synergy Research. Dominance in cloud services means AWS is ideally positioned to benefit as businesses spend more on artificial intelligence.\n\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter financial results that beat the consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 14% to $170 billion as growth accelerated sequentially across every business segment except physical stores. Operating margin expanded 600 basis points and GAAP net income was $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year. Investors should expect similar sales momentum in the coming quarters.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate leaves room for upside if the company reclaims lost market share in cloud computing, a distinct possibility given its focus on AI product development. However, the current valuation of 3.3 times sales is reasonable even if the consensus sales forecast is correct.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a final thought, JPMorgan Chase analysts selected Amazon as their \"best idea\" among internet stocks in 2024. More broadly, the stock carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" among Wall Street analysts, and its median one-year price target of $215 per share implies 20% upside from its current price of $179 per share.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk operates the leading independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Its software helps brands and their advertising agencies plan, measure, and optimize digital campaigns. The company has embedded its platform with sophisticated machine learning and measurement capabilities, which help media buyers spend their ad budgets more effectively.\n\nThe Trade Desk's independence -- meaning it does not own media content that could bias its behavior toward specific ad inventory -- has helped the company build trust with media buyers, such that its customer retention rate has exceeded 95% for the past decade. Its independence and scale has also led to partnerships with publishers (media sellers) in ways that would be impossible for competitors like Alphabet's Google.\n\nFor instance, The Trade Desk provides the underlying technology that powers Walmart's ad tech platform, a job that would never be entrusted to a competiting publisher like Google. The Trade Desk also sources data from many more of the world's largest retailers, including Target, Albertsons, and Walgreens, but those publishers are less likely to share information with competitors like Google. The upshot is The Trade Desk has access to robust data that not only affords its platform unique measurement capabilities, but also theoretically gives the company an edge in training the machine learning models that inform decision-making.\n\nThe Trade Desk reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 23% to $606 million and GAAP net income increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. On the earnings call, Jeff Green said The Trade Desk has gained market share for eight consecutive quarters, and he expects the company to continue gaining share. Management also guided for revenue growth to accelerate to 25% in the first quarter.\n\nGoing forward, The Trade Desk is well positioned to maintain that momentum due to its strong presence in connected TV advertising and retail media, two of the fastest-growing channels in the broader digital advertising market. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 20.8 times sales is tolerable, especially when the three-year average is 24.9 times sales. But investors should start with a small position.\n\nAs a final thought, The Trade Desk stock carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" among Wall Street analysts, and its median one-year price target of $100 per share implies 24% upside from its current price of $80.50 per share.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.\n\nThe relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products.\n\nBalancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late.\n\nThis is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet.\n\nTaking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that \"32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers.\" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere.\n\nOn a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023:\n\nEquity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%.\n\nThe strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top ethical stocks. A couple of top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024\n\nA trader at a stock exchange, vigorously watching the stocks' trends in the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best ethical stocks, we ranked the top 30 most valuable holdings of the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these best ethical stocks, we mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "U.S. Amazon Prime members can now order as many grocery deliveries as they’d like each month if they pay an extra fee and meet a certain dollar amount.\n\nThe additional monthly fee of $9.99 gives Prime members living in one of 3,500-plus areas access to Amazon’s new grocery delivery subscription, according to the company.\n\nThe unlimited deliveries offered through the subscription, which was introduced Tuesday, apply to orders that cost at least $35. An Amazon logo at a logistics center in Mannheim, Germany, Sept. 17, 2019.\n\nThey can place delivery orders with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market and a \"variety of local grocery and specialty retailers\" on the e-commerce giant’s site, Amazon said.\n\nAMAZON TO LAUNCH PRIME AIR DELIVERY DRONES TO ARIZONA CITY\n\nIt identified Rite Aid, Pet Food Express and Cardenas Markets as some of the local and specialty retailers.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAmazon said it will give Prime members \"unlimited 30-minute pickup on orders of any size\" and \"one-hour delivery windows at no extra cost where available.\" They also have \"priority access\" to its \"Recurring Reservations\" feature for Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods through it, according to the company.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.60 billion, implying a 15.2% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pinned at 59 cents per share, indicating a decline of 46.4% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nSTM surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 8.9%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nSTMicroelectronics N.V. Price and EPS Surprise STMicroelectronics N.V. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSTMicroelectronics N.V. price-eps-surprise | STMicroelectronics N.V. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nGrowing demand in the automotive product group across all geographies, driven by increasing semiconductor pervasion and structural transformation, is likely to have aided STM’s performance in the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum in the car digitalization market, due to continued design wins with its latest generation of automotive microcontrollers, is likely to have been a tailwind for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nStrength in embedded processing solutions, owing to its expanding STM32 portfolio, growing customer engagement for edge AI deployment and AI algorithm integration to existing microcontroller unit offerings, is likely to have boosted STM’s performance in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across the computer peripherals and communication equipment markets is expected to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing customer base for its power and energy, factory automation and robotics, and industrial infrastructure solutions are expected to have bolstered its performance in industrial end-market during the first quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing inventory correction is expected to have impacted its prospects in the industrial end-market negatively in the quarter under discussion.\r\n\r\nSTM’s weakening momentum across the personal electronics market is expected to have been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe growing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable seasonality are likely to have remained headwinds for the company in the first quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nThe Zacks model predicts that the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Amazon (AMZN)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 41.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 25.2%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -5.6%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Uncover Hidden Gems: 3 Silent Stocks Poised for Exponential Growth",
        "content": "A lot of success in the market goes unseen. Certain stocks tend to get written about ad nauseum while others get no attention at all. A stock like electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is down 43% on the year, and journalists and analysts on TV discuss it around the clock. At the same time, not a single analyst covers undervalued stocks like tow truck operator Miller Industries (NYSE:MLR) despite its share price being up nearly 50% in the past year.\n\nStocks that are attached to celebrity CEOs and popular consumer products that hedge funds widely hold tend to dominate the business press. However, these stocks account for a small percentage of the overall market. In reality, many great stocks have quietly but steadily outperformed, driven higher by competent management, strong earnings and a competitive edge. Let’s uncover three hidden gems that are undervalued stocks poised for exponential growth.\n\nIES Holdings (IESC) A graphic of a person's hands resting on a laptop with a stock line graph moving through it. top tech stocks. Underpriced Tech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent blog post, investor Eddy Elfenbein highlighted little-known stock, IES Holdings (NASDAQ:IESC). It has run circles around the broader market over the past decade. During the last five years, IESC stock has risen an astounding 574%. In the past 12 months, the share price has almost tripled and it is up more than 50% so far in 2024. The company provides electrical systems to residential houses, industrial facilities and some technology data centers. Not sexy or exciting, but it’s profitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn business since 1997, IES Holdings has 8,000 employees and $2.4 billion in annual revenues. Part of the reason IES Holdings is a silent stock is that no analysts cover the company. Zippo. Yet IESC stock is an incredible story. Consider that 12 years ago, the share price was at $1.75. Today, it is trading close to $120. In its last fiscal year, IES Holdings earned $4.71 per share. Sadly, the Houston, Texas-based company remains unheralded and little known.\n\nTextron (TXT) Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey shown during a flight demo.\n\nSource: Angel DiBilio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the investing world, it’s fair to say Textron (NYSE:TXT) doesn’t get a lot of attention. Based in Rhode Island, Textron began in 1923 as a textile company that mostly produced yarn. Today, Textron is an industrial conglomerate that produces products ranging from snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to small Cessna airplanes, as well as aircraft engines. The business unit that today makes aircraft engines has morphed from its original role of making household sewing machines.\n\nWhile it gets little notice, TXT stock has performed strongly, increasing nearly 40% in the last 12 months, including a 17% year-to-date gain. Since the pandemic in spring 2020, Textron’s stock has risen 260%. Strong earnings have helped to propel TXT stock higher. For 2024, Textron has forecast earnings growth of 58.6%. That is more than four times the industry average earnings growth of 12.3%. The company is well run and its transformation from textiles to industrials has clearly paid off.\n\nStory continues\n\nCopart (CPRT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConsidering its growth trajectory, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) deserves more love. In the past decade, the company that specializes in running online auctions for salvaged vehicles has seen its share price rise more than 1,000%. This includes a 220% increase since 2019. In fact, CPRT stock is one of the best performing securities of the last 20 years, outperforming e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Unfortunately, junk cars don’t generate a lot of attention in the business press.\n\nMuch of Copart’s success stems from the company’s very little competition. Some analysts claim Copart operates in a duopoly alongside IAA, a similar company that Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) acquired in 2023 by . But Copart is the much bigger player and market leader, giving it a wide competitive moat. This has led to consistently strong earnings from Copart, with its earnings per share (EPS) nearly tripling in the last five years and hitting a record $1.26 in fiscal 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in CPRT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 32% of His Portfolio Invested in These 3 Incredible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper is one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street. He founded Appaloosa Management in 1993 and eventually became a self-made billionaire. Over the last few years, he's returned much of his clients' funds, so Appaloosa is now primarily his own personal capital.\n\nSince Appaloosa is technically an institutional investor, investing on behalf of others, it's required to file form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter when it holds more than $100 million in assets. Appaloosa ended 2023 with $5.8 billion in assets under management.\n\nThanks to those public filings, we can get a glimpse at exactly how Tepper invests his money. And he's betting big on three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in 2024. Nearly one-third of his portfolio is tied up in these companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms (11%)\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the company behind leading social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. The company boasts nearly 4 billion unique users across its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp and Messenger. It's also developing augmented and virtual reality technology within its Reality Labs division.\n\nMeta's been investing heavily in artificial intelligence for the last few years. That shows up in its massive capital expenditures (capex), which topped $28 billion last year. That's a pullback from the $32 billion it spent in 2022.\n\nAll those capital expenditures are going toward building data centers to train AI algorithms such as its LLaMA large language model, which is now on its third version.\n\nMeta uses its AI algorithms to improve content and advertising recommendations within its Facebook and Instagram's Feed, Stories, and Reels. The advancements in AI turned Reels from a drag on revenue performance to additive in a shorter time frame than management expected.\n\nWhat's more, Meta can apply its generative AI capabilities to the ad-creation process, making it easier for marketers to test new ads on the platform and improve conversions. That boosts total advertisers and the amount they're willing to pay.\n\nMeta shares started strong in 2024, zooming 42% higher. But they were arguably very undervalued before the company's blowout fourth-quarter earnings and new dividend announcement.\n\nWith shares currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 24.5, the stock looks fairly valued. In fact, shares may still have a lot of room to grow when you consider that analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an average rate of 24.5% over the next five years, giving it a PEG ratio of 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (11%)\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) vaulted to the forefront of the AI conversation when it added $10 billion to its investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023. It's now leveraging that position to fuel its cloud computing and enterprise software businesses.\n\nMicrosoft Azure makes it easy to deploy AI applications using a growing number of large language models. Microsoft now counts 53,000 Azure AI customers, up more than 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nAs a result, it's been growing revenue faster than its competitors in the space. Azure sales climbed 30% in Microsoft's second quarter. By comparison, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet saw their cloud computing segments grow just 13% and 26%, respectively. Granted, Amazon's cloud business is bigger than Microsoft's, but Google Cloud remains the smallest of the three and is falling further behind.\n\nMicrosoft is also incorporating generative AI capabilities into its enterprise software through its Copilot features. Developers can use its Github Copilot to help them code more efficiently. The company is developing Copilot applications for sales, customer service, healthcare, retail, and everyday productivity tasks in its Microsoft 365 suite. As it taps into its existing user base of millions, it could sell a lot of Copilot subscriptions.\n\nMicrosoft's stock isn't cheap but may be worth the price. It trades at a forward P/E of around 30.9. While analysts see strong revenue growth and slight margin expansion over the next five years, they still only expect 15.4% earnings growth.\n\nBut when you combine Microsoft's strong cash position and massive free cash flow supporting its dividend and buybacks, it might be worth following Tepper into some shares of the most valuable company on the market.\n\nAmazon (10%)\n\nAmazon is best known for its incredibly popular online marketplace, where its Prime members can receive millions of items within 24 hours with just the click of a button. While the company continues to grow its share of the e-commerce market, its advertising and cloud computing businesses are sure to fuel its earnings growth for years to come.\n\nAmazon is the market leader in public cloud services. While Microsoft is making significant headway, cutting into Amazon's market share recently, the e-commerce leader is quickly reestablishing itself. After Amazon Web Sales (AWS) slowed to 12% in mid-2023, the segment started showing signs of life, accelerating to 13% growth in the fourth quarter. That's still well behind the competition, but Amazon is investing heavily to catch up in AI.\n\nThe company invested $4 billion in Anthropic, gaining more access to its leading generative AI technology. It introduced Amazon Bedrock last year, making it easy for new and existing AWS customers to launch generative AI applications using a number of large language models.\n\nIt's also developing its own chips designed for training AI models and deploying them in applications. These chips are more power efficient than general graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, which has seen its prices skyrocket amid the AI boom.\n\nManagement believes we're still in the very early innings of the generative AI boom, so there's plenty of time for it to catch up. It's investing with a long-term mindset, which has worked out well for Amazon in the past.\n\nShares of Amazon currently trade at a price-to-sales ratio of around 3.3. Due to the company's double-digit revenue growth and expanding margin expectations, investors will pay a fair price for the stock today. But if Amazon can start winning back share in cloud computing, it could easily outperform the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Broadcom Faces Backlash Over Licensing, EU Trade Groups Demand Investigation\n\nOn Monday, critics of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) dismissed the U.S. chipmaker’s revisions to its cloud licensing practices, arguing that the changes fail to resolve their concerns over alleged price increases, unfair software licensing terms, and product bundling.\n\nLast week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan announced in a blog post a series of modifications to the licensing conditions of the recently acquired cloud computing company VMware, following grievances from some EU business users and a trade group.\n\nThese adjustments included significant price reductions for VMware’s cloud platform and alterations that allow customers to transfer their workloads from their own data centers to cloud providers and among various cloud providers, Reuters reports.\n\nAlso Read: Broadcom Succumbs to EU Antitrust Investigation Over VMware Licensing, Prompting Swift Pricing Strategy Revision\n\nHowever, trade body CISPE, with members like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and 26 small EU cloud providers, along with the French association of business users Cigref and Austrian cloud service provider Anexia, both CISPE members, declared that the real issue lies not with Broadcom’s subscription license model.\n\nIn a joint statement, they criticized the substantial and unjustifiable price hikes, product rebundling, changes to the billing basis, and the imposition of unfair software licensing terms that limit choice and lock in customers and partners.\n\nBroadcom, in response, stated that it was providing more choices for customers and partners.\n\nThe groups have urged EU antitrust regulators, who have sought opinions from rivals and customers, to investigate the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer has picked Broadcom as one of his top semiconductor picks, citing the combination of expanding earnings power over time, sticky/stable industrial/infrastructure exposure, and defensible technology.\n\nAccording to the analyst, Broadcom will benefit from its position as the top high-speed networking/connectivity/custom computing supplier as the demand for data center artificial intelligence continues to rise.\n\nSchafer said Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) noted some signs of improved carrier spending due to a 2% demand pickup in handset demand, which will likely be Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom stock gained 93% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "The 7 Best Positioned Dow Stocks for April 2024",
        "content": "I’d argue that investing in the Dow in April is a particularly smart move. Dow Jones stocks represent 30 of the most prominent U.S. firms. Stocks listed in the Dow tend to be more defensive than the Nasdaq and other indices.\n\nThe reason that matters is that investors are currently seeking safety. Rate cut expectations are softening and treasury yields rising. That combination of factors is strongly suggestive of softness for more tech-oriented shares and other growth stocks. Conversely, it is a boon for more defensive stocks like those found on the Dow.\n\nDow stocks tend to be more defensive although they certainly have significant growth potential in some cases. Anyway, they look strong at the moment as the markets digest the latest news on rate cuts and Treasury yields.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the index generally looks strong there are better positions therein. Let’s take a look at seven of those.\n\nDow Stocks: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMention the name Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and most investors immediately associate it with e-commerce first. That’s logical given that Amazon’s online shopping platform is the primary driver of the stock’s performance.\n\nHowever, Amazon is so much more. That’s what I want to talk about: Amazon’s other efforts and why they should inspire investors to plow money into it.\n\nThe next most important business segment for Amazon is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is the leader in the cloud segment with a substantial lead over its main rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nCloud is particularly important at the moment as it is a primary investment area for artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon is making massive moves there. The company recently announced that it will invest $150 billion over the next 15 years in cloud AI. Thus, it’s clear that Amazon intends to dominate the cloud via its investment in the necessary muscle for increased AI compute workloads.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon continues to battle Walmart (NYSE:WMT) for retail dominance. Remember, Walmart is the largest grocer in the United States. Amazon is expanding its grocery store footprint through Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. In short, there are multiple reasons to believe that Amazon continues to be among the best positioned Dow stocks in April and beyond.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can give readers at least two strong, logical reasons that Visa (NYSE:V) stock is an excellent investment.\n\nThe first is simply that credit card usage and credit card debt continue to soar to new historical highs. Current American credit card debt sits at a massive balance of $1.129 trillion. Balances have risen by $273 billion since the fourth quarter of 2021. To give a bit more context, total credit card debt was below $500 billion at the turn of the millennium. The point here is simple and powerful: credit card issuers like Visa are very well positioned to capitalize on surging credit usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Visa is the most widely accepted credit card globally. That’s particularly important as the world increasingly moves toward a more cashless global society.  Speaking anecdotally, I was recently visiting Korea which is quickly becoming a cashless society.  My Visa card was accepted everywhere. Fintech will continue to grow and Visa has a strong lead through the massive Network it has built over several decades.\n\nDow Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft stock, along with many other tech shares, is currently being punished by the markets as the rate cut fears increase and treasury yields rise. Investors should take this brief opportunity to pick up Microsoft shares as it will not last.\n\nShare prices have fallen from $427 to $403 as I write this. The S&P 500 continues to fall as the markets wonder whether there will be any rate cuts at all in 2024. Treasury yields are also rising causing investors to diversify away from the stock market and into perceived safety. The result is that Microsoft shares are currently cheap.\n\nFor those wondering if Microsoft is suddenly on the precipice of a long drawdown, don’t worry. Instead, look at its most recent earnings report. Remember how large Microsoft is. Then, consider that its revenues grew by 18% in the period.\n\nAfter you digested that fact, then consider its cloud revenues grew by 24%. Those revenues represent more than half of all revenues. The point there is that Microsoft is incredibly well positioned as AI takes off. Yes, the company is seeing some softness in relation to demand for its AI CoPilot product. Bears that focus on that fact are missing the larger narrative which is that Microsoft is growing by leaps and bounds due to AI.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock has fallen by $5 to $167 over the prior week. There’s good news and bad news there. I would suggest that investors pay attention to the good news and remain bullish because Chevron is one of the best positioned Dow stocks in April.\n\nThe bad news for Chevron is that there’s currently a bit of a fear and trepidation in the markets about the economy. If the economy tanks, the result is lower oil consumption as overall activity slows. Thus, oil prices fall and producers including Chevron fall in tandem.\n\nThe good news is that oil prices continue to be strong on turmoil in the Middle East. I believe that that will be the more important story for Chevron and other energy firms moving forward. Frankly, I don’t think the economy is in much trouble currently. I do think that there is a lot of geopolitical turmoil, however.\n\nIt’s evident in the fact that energy sector returns have essentially mirrored tech returns thus far in 2024. Chevron is the best Dow stock by which to capture those gains moving forward.\n\nDow Stocks: Coca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is always one of the first defensive stocks to consider when fear is on the rise.\n\nInvestors turn to Consumer Packaged Goods firms and other shares that tend to benefit from steady demand across a variety of macroeconomic environments in such times.\n\nIt seems that fear is rising as we head toward the end of April. That creates an opportunity for Coca-Cola stock and investors. Search the term ‘all weather stocks’ or something  similar and Coca-Cola is almost certain to come up. I’m probably beating a dead horse here but it’s shares have a very long history of thriving in the best and worst of times. The point is that if current fear materializes into something more serious, Coca-Cola is well positioned.\n\nThe other positive regarding Coca-Cola is that Wall Street believes there’s roughly an additional $8 of upside beyond its current $58 price. Look to Dow stocks for defensive strength and to KO stock for strength within that strength.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is another defensive Dow stock that looks particularly well positioned at the moment. I say that because I think investors are likely to pivot into defensive positions, especially those that provide income.\n\nHoneywell is an excellent choice in that regard. The company recently announced its 14th dividend increase since 2010. During that time frame the income provided has increased from $1.21 to $4.32 at present.\n\nHoneywell is an industrial company and that continues to beat earnings expectations in what many have characterized as a difficult economy. The company also tends to guide conservatively, thus having the potential to outperform.\n\nOverall, it has a unique combination of steady industrial sector performance and income. It also has a strong connection to artificial intelligence. Honeywell builds robotics that have the potential to replace factory floor workers. The company is applying AI to those machines and has a real shot at creating highly valuable use cases for manufacturing oriented firms.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) management is positioning the company for a period of rapid growth. I believe that’s very important to MCD stock at the moment. Growth investors are looking to artificial intelligence to capture perceived growth in the near to midterm.\n\nWhile I have no problem with that logic I also think that those same investors should look at McDonald’s. The company is entering its fastest period of growth in its history. However, that growth is not predicated on AI making it much less risky.\n\nMcDonald’s plans to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That equates to roughly a 23% increase over its current restaurant count. It’s clear that McDonald’s will grow rapidly over the coming few years.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald’s is also aiming to take market share from competitors including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that sell high margin beverages. If McDonald’s can successfully scale its CosMc’s business growth will be turbocharged. There’s a lot to like about McDonald’s in April as defensiveness rises and even more to like in the midterm as its growth ramps up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Microsoft’s MSFT third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, scheduled to be reported on Apr 25, are likely to be driven by the consistent growth in its cloud platform, Azure.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues (Azure falls under the segment) between $26 billion and $26.3 billion.\r\n\r\nOur model estimate for Intelligent Cloud revenues is currently pegged at $26.01 billion, indicating 17.8% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nAzure's Continued Growth to Propel MSFT's Top Line in Q3\n\nMicrosoft is witnessing robust demand for its cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions. This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 30% (up 28% at cc), including roughly 6 points from AI services, which was higher than the previous quarter's 29% (28% at cc). In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth at cc to remain stable in the fiscal third quarter, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services. Additionally, the company's per-user business is expected to have benefited from the momentum in the Microsoft 365 suite.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, MSFT announced the expansion of its collaboration with Oracle ORCL to meet growing customer demand for Oracle Database@Azure with five more regions, which brings the total planned multi-cloud availability footprint to 15 regions globally.\r\n\r\nAzure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened the tech giant's competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon’s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (14% of sales) rose 13% year over year to $24.2 billion, with operating income of $7.2 billion, up 37.7% year over year. The expansion of AWS' portfolio has been helping Amazon maintain its dominance in the cloud domain by gaining more customers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet's Google Cloud revenues rose 25.7% year over year to $9.19 billion, accounting for 10.6% of the quarter’s total revenues. Google Cloud reported operating income of $864 million against a loss of $186 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAzure AI Gives MSFT Competitive Edge in Generative AI Market\n\nMicrosoft has tightly integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 language model into its Bing search engine and Edge browser, delivering a ChatGPT-like experience to users. The Azure OpenAI Service enables developers to easily incorporate large language models and generative AI into applications across various use cases.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal second quarter, MSFT witnessed solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers. More than one-third of customers are new to Azure over the past 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe company has launched copilot templates that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and streamline store operations using generative AI. Microsoft and OpenAI are collaborating on an advanced data center project to meet the immense computational demands of complex generative AI tasks.\r\n\r\nDespite these cutting-edge AI moves, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 10% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 11.1% growth amid intensifying competition from Amazon and Alphabet as they are all making aggressive moves to expand their generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAWS is leveraging AMZN’s Bedrock, which provides access to high-performance foundation models from AI firms through an API. Alphabet’s Google has been swiftly iterating its language models, releasing the Multitask Unified Model and Pathways Language Model to bolster its search capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nThe launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For those looking to find strong Retail-Wholesale stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Amazon (AMZN) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Retail-Wholesale sector should help us answer this question.\n\nAmazon is one of 215 companies in the Retail-Wholesale group. The Retail-Wholesale group currently sits at #9 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's full-year earnings has moved 12.4% higher within the past quarter. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.\n\nBased on the most recent data, AMZN has returned 16.7% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Retail-Wholesale group have gained about 6.5% on average.

        "content": "New Custom Model Import capability lets customers easily bring their proprietary models to Amazon Bedrock so they can take advantage of its powerful capabilities\n\nNew Model Evaluation capability makes it easier and faster for customers to take advantage of the widest selection of fully managed models including the new RAG-optimized Titan Embeddings V2 and the latest models from Cohere and Meta\n\nGuardrails for Amazon Bedrock provides customers with best-in-class technology to help them effectively implement safeguards tailored to their application needs and aligned with their responsible AI policies\n\nTens of thousands of customers and partners, including adidas, ADP, Aha!, Amazon.com, Bridgewater Associates, Choice Hotels, Clariant, Delta Air Lines, Dentsu, FOX Corporation, GoDaddy, Hugging Face, Infor, Intuit, Kone, KT Corporation, LexisNexis Legal & Professional, Lonely Planet, Netsmart, New York Stock Exchange, Pearson, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Perplexity AI, Ricoh USA, Rocket Mortgage, Ryanair, Salesforce, Siemens, Thomson Reuters, Toyota, Tui, United Airlines, and others are using Amazon Bedrock to build and deploy generative AI applications\n\nSEATTLE, April 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new Amazon Bedrock innovations that offer customers the easiest, fastest, and most secure way to develop advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications and experiences. Tens of thousands of customers have already selected Amazon Bedrock as the foundation for their generative AI strategy because it gives them access to the broadest selection of leading foundation models (FMs) from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon, along with the capabilities and enterprise security they need to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock’s powerful models are offered as a fully managed service so customers do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, ensuring their applications operate with seamless deployment, scalability, and continuous optimization. Today’s announcements empower customers to run their own fully managed models on Amazon Bedrock, make it simple to find the best model for their use case, make it easier to apply safeguards to generative AI applications, and provide them even more model choice. To get started with Amazon Bedrock, visit aws.amazon.com/bedrock.\n\nOrganizations across all industries, from the world’s fastest growing startups to the most security-conscious enterprises and government institutions, are using Amazon Bedrock to spark innovation, increase productivity, and create new end-user experiences. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is leveraging Amazon Bedrock's choice of FMs and cutting-edge AI generative capabilities across several use cases, including the processing of thousands of pages of regulations to provide answers in easy-to-understand language. Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, is using Amazon Bedrock to help its crew to instantly find answers to questions about country-specific regulations or extract summaries from manuals, to keep their passengers moving. Netsmart, a technology provider that specializes in designing, building, and delivering electronic health records (EHRs) for community-based care organizations, is working to enhance the clinical documentation experience for healthcare providers. They aim to reduce the time spent managing the health records of individuals by up to 50% with their generative AI automation tool built on Amazon Bedrock. This will lead Netsmart clients to speed-up patient reimbursement submissions while also improving patient care.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Amazon Bedrock is experiencing explosive growth, with tens of thousands of organizations of all sizes and across all industries choosing it as the foundation for their generative AI strategy because they can use it to move from experimentation to production more quickly and easily than anywhere else,\" said Dr. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of AI and Data at AWS. \"Customers are excited by Amazon Bedrock because it offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, wide choice of leading foundation models, and the easiest way to build generative AI applications. With today’s announcements, we continue to innovate rapidly for our customers by doubling-down on our commitment to provide them with the most comprehensive set of capabilities and choice of industry-leading models, further democratizing generative AI innovation at scale.\"\n\nNew Custom Model Import capability helps organizations bring their own customized models to Amazon Bedrock, reducing operational overhead and accelerating application development\n\nIn addition to having access to the world’s most powerful models on Amazon Bedrock–from AI21 Labs, Amazon, Anthropic, and Cohere, to Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI–customers across healthcare, financial services, and other industries are increasingly putting their own data to work by customizing publicly available models for their domain-specific use cases. When organizations want to build these models using their proprietary data, they typically turn to services like Amazon SageMaker, which offers the best-in-class training capabilities to train a model from scratch or perform advanced customization on publicly available models such as Llama, Mistral, and Flan-T5. Since launching 2017, Amazon SageMaker has become the place where the world’s high-performing FMs–including Falcon 180, the largest publicly available model to date–are built and trained. Customers also want to use all of Amazon Bedrock’s advanced, built-in generative AI tools such as Knowledge Bases, Guardrails, Agents, and Model Evaluation, with their customized models, without having to develop all these capabilities themselves.\n\nWith Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, organizations can now import and access their own custom models as a fully managed application programming interface (API) in Amazon Bedrock, giving them unprecedented choice when building generative AI applications. In just a few clicks, customers can take models that they customized on Amazon SageMaker, or other tools, and easily add them to Amazon Bedrock. Once through an automated validation process, they can seamlessly access their custom model, like any other on Amazon Bedrock, getting all the same benefits that they get today–including seamless scalability and powerful capabilities to safeguard their applications, adhering to responsible AI principles, the ability to expand a model’s knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), easily creating agents to complete multi-step tasks, and carrying out fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models–without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. With this new capability, AWS makes it easy for organizations to choose a combination of Amazon Bedrock models and their own custom models via the same API. Today, Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import is available in preview and supports three of the most popular open model architectures, Flan-T5, Llama, and Mistral and with plans for more in the future.\n\nModel Evaluation helps customers assess, compare, and select the best model for their application\n\nWith the broadest range of industry-leading models, Amazon Bedrock helps organizations to meet any price, performance, or capability requirements they may have and allows them to run models on their own or in combination with others. However, choosing the best model for a specific use case requires customers to strike a delicate balance between accuracy and performance. Until now, organizations needed to spend countless hours analyzing how every new model can meet their use case, limiting how quickly they could deliver transformative generative AI experiences to their end users. Now generally available, Model Evaluation is the fastest way for organizations to analyze and compare models on Amazon Bedrock, reducing time from weeks to hours spent evaluating models so they can bring new applications and experiences to market faster. Customers can get started quickly by selecting predefined evaluation criteria (e.g., accuracy and robustness) and uploading their own dataset or prompt library, or by selecting from built-in, publicly available resources. For subjective criteria or content requiring nuanced judgment, Amazon Bedrock makes it easy for customers to add humans into the workflow to evaluate model responses based on use-case specific metrics (e.g., relevance, style, and brand voice). Once the setup process is finished, Amazon Bedrock runs evaluations and generates a report so customers can easily understand how the model performed across their key criteria and quickly select the best models for their use cases.\n\nWith Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock, customers can use best in class technology to easily implement safeguards to remove personal and sensitive information, profanity, specific words, as well as block harmful content\n\nFor generative AI to be pervasive across every industry, organizations need to implement it in a safe, trustworthy, and responsible way. Many models use built-in controls to filter undesirable and harmful content, but most customers want to further tailor their generative AI applications so responses remain relevant, align with company policies, and adhere to responsible AI principles. Now generally available, Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock offers industry-leading safety protection on top of the native capabilities of FMs, helping customers block up to 85% of harmful content. Guardrails is the only solution offered by a top cloud provider that allows customers to have built-in and custom safeguards in a single offering, and it works with all large language models (LLMs) in Amazon Bedrock, as well as fine-tuned models. To create a guardrail, customers simply provide a natural-language description defining the denied topics within the context of their application. Customers can also configure thresholds to filter across areas like hate speech, insults, sexualized language, prompt injection, and violence, as well as filters to remove any personal and sensitive information, profanity, or specific blocked words. Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock empowers customers to innovate quickly and safely by providing a consistent user experience and standardizing safety and privacy controls across generative AI applications.\n\nMore model choice: introducing Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2, the general availability of Titan Image Generator, and the latest models from Cohere and Meta\n\nExclusive to Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Titan models are created and pre-trained by AWS on large and diverse datasets for a variety of use cases, with built-in support for the responsible use of AI. Today, Amazon Bedrock continues to grow the Amazon Titan family, giving customers even greater choice and flexibility. Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2, which is optimized for working with RAG use cases, is well suited for a variety of tasks such as information retrieval, question and answer chatbots, and personalized recommendations. To augment FM responses with additional data, many organizations turn to RAG, a popular model-customization technique where the FM connects to a knowledge source that it can reference to augment its responses. However, running these operations can be compute and storage intensive. The new Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 model, launching next week, reduces storage and compute costs, all while increasing accuracy. It does so by allowing flexible embeddings to customers, which reduces overall storage up to 4x, significantly reducing operational costs, while retaining 97% of the accuracy for RAG use cases, out-performing other leading models.\n\nNow, generally available, Amazon Titan Image Generator helps customers in industries like advertising, ecommerce, and media and entertainment produce studio-quality images or enhance and edit existing images, at low cost, using natural language prompts. Amazon Titan Image Generator also applies an invisible watermark to all images it creates, helping identify AI-generated images to promote the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology and helping reduce the spread of disinformation. The model can also check for the existence of watermark, helping customers conﬁrm whether an image was generated by Amazon Titan Image Generator.\n\nAlso available today on Amazon Bedrock are Meta Llama 3 FMs and coming soon are the Command R and Command R+ models from Cohere. Llama 3 is designed for developers, researchers, and businesses to build, experiment, and responsibly scale their generative AI ideas. The Llama 3 models are a collection of pre-trained and instruction fine-tuned LLMs that support a broad range of use cases. They are particularly suited for text summarization and classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and code generation. Cohere’s Command R, and Command R+ models are state-of-the-art FMs customers can use to build enterprise-grade generative AI applications with advanced RAG capabilities, in 10 languages, to support their global business operations.\n\nWhat Amazon Bedrock customers and partners are saying\n\nBuilt by Amazon, Rufus is a generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant trained on the company’s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web to answer customer questions on a variety of shopping needs and products, provide comparisons, and make recommendations based on conversational context. \"To offer a superior conversational shopping experience to Amazon Stores customers, we worked to develop Rufus into one of the most advanced models ever created by Amazon, and one we knew would benefit our customers far beyond this initial application,\" said Trishul Chilimbi, vice president and distinguished scientist, Stores Foundational AI at Amazon. \"With Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, we are now able to bring Rufus’s advanced underlying model to internal Amazon developers, via Amazon Bedrock, allowing even more builders across our organization to access it as a fully managed API.

        "title": "Investors Could Be Concerned With Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Returns On Capital",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.10 = US$37b ÷ (US$528b - US$165b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Amazon.com Tell Us?\n\nIn terms of Amazon.com's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 10%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nOn a side note, Amazon.com has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 31% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Amazon.com's ROCE\n\nIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Amazon.com is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 84% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're still interested in Amazon.com it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation for AMZN to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\n\nWhile Amazon.com isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Don’t Miss the Boat! 7 Stocks That Can Change Your Life by 2030",
        "content": "Finding stocks to buy in today’s relatively overvalued and volatile market isn’t as easy as it was when initial rate cuts dropped top stocks to bottom-barrel pricing. While many quickly point to tech stocks as the main wealth drivers in today’s economy, forward-thinking investors know to seek diversification across industries, geographic locations, size, scale, and more.\n\nLikewise, finding long-term stocks to buy demands thorough due diligence to ensure that a company has a strategic vision and actionable plans to achieve its goals. Financial fundamentals and strength are equally clutch today; even the best strategies are futile if the company risks bankruptcy.\n\nEach of these seven stocks to buy offers a unique range of sectors and value propositions while standing on solid financial footing and boasting brighter long-term prospects than much of the market — making them prime candidates for a buy-and-hold strategy through 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigi International (DGII)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDigi International (NASDAQ:DGII), an Internet of Things (IoT) tech stock, stands out among stocks to buy on its relatively low profile coupled with remarkable strength. Surprising considering its small-cap status, Digi International just marked its 20th consecutive profitable year, with a 14% CAGR over the past decade and 17% over the past five years. The company manufactures and distributes products essential for industrial-level IoT expansion, including embedded network connections and scalable USB and cellular communication modules.\n\nIoT is swiftly expanding across national markets, with full globalization on the horizon. Currently, there are just over 15 billion IoT-connected devices, a number expected to double by 2030. In response, management projects continued short-term strength, forecasting its annual recurring revenue to double by 2028. Despite a slump in shares this year, Digi is a top choice for investors seeking IoT stocks to buy.\n\nSharkninja (SN) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWide-ranging appliance manufacturer Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) is one of today’s most robust consumer stocks to buy despite its relative investor inattention. Debuting during last year’s challenging summer market, Sharkninja remained remarkably resilient. Shares climbed 130% higher post-listing in less than a year, outperforming the S&P 500 by a huge margin. However, it’s not just the stock’s short-term strength and resilience that set Sharkninja apart from other stocks to buy; it’s the company’s solid operational fundamentals that position it for significant growth in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSharkninja employs a simple yet ingenious business model: it provides high-end, semi-luxury appliances like ice cream makers and upscale coffee machines at affordable prices. By targeting consumers who prioritize both budget and quality, Sharkninja satisfies a unique market demand, especially relevant in today’s economy, where consumers seek durable, quality products that align with tighter budgets. Consistently, the company has expanded its sales by 20% annually since 2008, with no signs of slowing down over the next decade.\n\nVita Coco Company (COCO) Creative image of growing coin stacks and candlestick forex chart on blurry background. Trade, money and financial growth concept. Growth stocks. Double exposure\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) continue to dominate headlines, but the Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) is rapidly gaining ground among beverage stocks to buy. While the energy and standard sports drink markets are highly competitive, Vita Coco dominates the coconut water segment and owns more than half of the total addressable market.\n\nThrough a strategic partnership with British alcohol brand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Vita Coco is also making significant inroads into the ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage market by launching a line of spiked coconut water options. Although coconut water mixed with Captain Morgan might not be to everyone’s taste, this emerging market is booming and expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2029, with Vita Coco well-positioned to capture a large share of this growth.\n\nFinancially, Vita Coco recently exceeded expectations with a 4% earnings beat at year-end, fueled by a nearly 500% increase in net income for the year and a 9.4% profit margin. While everyone knows how Monster became one of the century’s top-performing stocks, Vita Coco might be on track to replicate its success.\n\nFair Isaac Corp (FICO) Button with the word risk pointing between medium and high level, 3D render suitable for risk management or decision-making process situation. represents risk tolerance\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp (NYSE:FICO), known for its consumer credit risk measurement system (FICO score), is trading relatively flat in 2024, dipping less than 1% since January 1st despite rising nearly 60% over the past year. As revolving consumer credit reaches record highs and society moves away from cash-based transacting, Fair Isaac is increasingly integral to the evolving digital economy.\n\nFair Isaac is also unique among data analytics stocks to buy, benefiting from AI in the coming years. CEO Will Lansing mentioned in a recent interview that Fair Isaac has leveraged AI and machine learning for the past twenty years, positioning it not as a newcomer but as a pioneer in the field. As technology progresses, the company’s deep expertise in data analytics allows it to explore innovative AI applications and expand its market presence. This capability points to continued strength through 2030, even if its short-term per-share pricing isn’t spectacular.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce continues to surge in popularity—think giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and smaller-cap competitors like the ill-fated ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), while not as widely known, operates similarly but targets the massive B2B market. It also offers small businesses a comprehensive one-stop shop to source products and handle a range of related management tasks.\n\nProduct and inventory management, along with sourcing and payment processing, is tough for smaller businesses when accounting for the many international business nuances. GigaCloud provides a complete solution for scaled B2B eCommerce needs, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, crucially, safe and secure cross-border payments.\n\nGigaCloud’s price-to-earnings ratio is notably low at just 15x, which is significantly below the tech sector’s average of 33x. This discrepancy becomes even more apparent when considering GigaCloud’s earnings growth. The company has doubled its earnings per share over the past four quarters and maintained strong free cash flow per share, all while trading at a solid discount.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is unique among software industry stocks to buy as it merges AI with automation, focusing on office administration—a sector often overshadowed by more glamorous tech sectors. Better yet, this software stock ranks among Cathie Wood’s top picks, and she particularly likes the stock based on its harnessing corporate data’s latent potential and turning it into actionable insights.\n\nIn a discussion, Wood emphasized UiPath’s software-centric investment strategy, contrasting it with hardware investments, which she views as having more limited upside. She pointed out that software firms can continuously innovate on existing hardware platforms. She also highlighted UiPath’s access to proprietary data across a multitude of global firms, which it uses to automate mundane tasks efficiently.\n\nUiPath recently gained Federal authorization to extend its software solutions to public sectors, a move likely to streamline governmental processes plagued by inefficiency. Securing Federal contracts, known for their lucrative returns, positions UiPath to better diversify and solidify its revenue streams and buffer it against market shocks in coming years.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) stands at the intersection of semiconductor stocks to buy and cheap stocks that are tough to pass up – a perfect combo, considering so many semiconductor companies are increasingly pricy. The semiconductor stock specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a niche semiconductor segment subset with big implications for the future.\n\nPhotronics’ semiconductor photomasks enhance precision and accuracy essential for patterning microchips, advancing next-gen fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing since these sectors require increasingly complex and precise circuitry. Additionally, these photomasks possess fine details that contribute to the miniaturization of transistors and components, operationalizing Moore’s Law to shrink down complex tech. Its combination of value propositions and relative cheapness (trading at just 12x earnings) positions Photronics at the crucial nexus of current and emerging technologies, making Photronics a strong candidate among semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Layoffs 2024: 3 Stocks That Ought to Copy Tesla’s Job Cuts",
        "content": "The rubber hit the road on April 15 as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount to reduce costs and increase productivity.\n\n“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Investor’s Business Daily reported Elon Musk’s comments from his memo sent to employees.\n\n“We are developing some of the most revolutionary technologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, with all the executive departures, he might need someone to help him achieve all these amazing things he has in store for the world.\n\nOne thing that rings true in Musk’s comments is the CEO’s suggestion that the company’s rapid growth has led to the duplication of some jobs and functions in certain parts. What, specifically, are these areas of overlap and redundancy? We won’t know until the cuts are made.\n\nIn the meantime, plenty of other companies in the S&P 500 could use a little downsizing.\n\nWhile I’ve never been a fan of overhiring or overfiring, sometimes you overshoot, requiring a rightsizing to balance expenses with growth.\n\nHere are three that stand out for me.\n\nExpeditors International of Washington (EXPD) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpeditors International of Washington (NYSE:EXPD) isn’t an obvious candidate for job cuts. It makes money, and its shares have been up 45% for the past five years. While that doesn’t compare to the 70% gain for the index, at least it’s in positive territory.\n\nThe big issue for the Seattle-based logistics company is that its revenues and profits are cratering.\n\nIn Q4 2023, its revenues dropped 34% to $2.3 billion, while its operating income fell 40% to $199 million, an operating margin of 8.7%. That’s 140 basis points less than TFI International (NYSE:TFII), a Canadian logistics and transportation company.\n\nExpeditors finished 2023 with 18,000 employees. Five years ago, it had the same number of employees and about the same revenue and operating income as this past year.\n\nAll its growth vanished in 2023.\n\nNo wonder none of the 17 analysts covering its stock have a Buy rating, while nine believe it’s a Sell, with a target price of $108.50, below where it’s currently trading.\n\nAs for TFII, 16 of the 20 analysts rate it a Buy. The cream always rises to the top.\n\nIllinois Tool Works (ITW) Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browser\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), like Expeditors, isn’t an obvious candidate for job cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough its revenue has fallen by 10% over the past decade, its operating profits and margins have improved dramatically. As a result, its earnings per share of $9.74 in 2023 is 3x higher than in 2012, a compound annual growth rate of 16.8%.\n\nWhat’s the problem, you might ask? If you compare its stock’s performance over the past five years, it’s underperformed by 150 percentage points relative to GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE). Kudos to GE CEO Larry Culp for turning something awful into something valuable. It wasn’t easy.\n\nAccording to the Liberated Stock Trader, ITW has 46,000 employees in 2024. The company’s 10-K doesn’t say how many. However, the proxy says it was 45,000 at the end of December, with two-thirds outside the U.S. In 2019, it was also 45,000.\n\nThe board will note that margins have improved significantly over the past decade and that ITW has a 10-year annualized total return of 13.02%. However, the majority of the gains came between 2012 and 2017 (up 269% through January 2018), compared to 45% from January 2018 through April 2024.\n\nIf you’re not increasing your employee headcount, you’re really not growing. It’s better to sell off the least-performing businesses, as GE did, and become less of a conglomerate. Investors will pay up for that.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the introduction, I said I would only include companies from the S&P 500. And even though Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was booted from the index in February—Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced it—it has become bloated with way too much overhead beyond any reasonable justification.\n\nAccording to the Liberated Stock Trader, Walgreens had 325,000 employees at the beginning of January. The company’s 10-K (Aug. 31, 2023, is the latest fiscal year) put the number at 331,000, with 38% part-time working 30 hours or less weekly.\n\nWell, the company is doing layoffs — InvestorPlace’s William White reported on April 18 that the company was cutting staff from its Chicago facility and reducing the hours for employees in the stores by 4-7% — and has been for months, it can’t cut deep enough to deliver shareholder value.\n\nI was a fan of the former CEO, Roz Brewer, who joined the company in March 2021 but stepped down last September. The company’s move into healthcare wasn’t where Brewer wanted to go with the company. She and the board appear to have agreed to disagree. That’s merely my speculation on the matter.\n\nAt the time of her departure, I suggested three possible candidates to replace her–the former CEO of pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts.\n\nWhile it’s a decent hire, WBA needs to cut more fat from the top down. I guess we’ll see.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "At record lows, you can find undervalued gems that could be great comeback stocks. Investors have left these stocks for dead, and sentiment is overly negative. Any slight improvement in sentiment and fundamentals can send these stocks soaring.\n\nDespite the S&P 500’s bull market since November 2022, some stocks have been in bearish runs. These stocks have been hitting all-time lows due to some idiosyncratic challenges. Worse, investor sentiment has hit record lows on these stocks, leading to a cascade of sellers pushing the stocks lower.\n\nHowever, the selloff in these stocks is overdone. In other words, the pendulum has swung very far on the bearish side. Historically, extreme stock downturns can be breeding grounds for substantial gains in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter steep selloffs, these comeback stocks are now trading materially below their intrinsic value. Moreover, with fundamental improvements on the horizon, there is a path for rising stock prices going forward.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) has been in a downward spiral due to several setbacks. Its delivery numbers have disappointed, forcing investors to dial back growth expectations. A slowdown in electric vehicle demand has also hit the entire industry.\n\nStill, Rivian can be one of the best comeback stocks of the decade. Despite the recent slump in demand, Statista projects worldwide EV sales to grow 9.82% annually over the next four years. With states like California setting zero-emission vehicle requirements, the EV market will only expand.\n\nCurrent demand headwinds plaguing the industry are temporary. Fortunately, Rivian is well-capitalized and has the partners to ride out this storm. As of Dec. 31, 2023, it had $9.37 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nMoreover, it has a strong partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which also owns 16% of its stock. Amazon ordered 100,000 EV delivery vans and Rivian has delivered about 13,500 vans so far. Rivian will be able to sustain operations through these orders as it awaits consumer demand for its RI and R2 EVs.\n\nAs of this writing, Rivian’s market capitalization of $8.4 billion is lower than the cash on its balance sheet. Rivian is one of the top-rated EV makers and will be one of the winners in the EV supercycle.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR) The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past year, fears of fixed wireless competition and fiber overbuilding have been a headwind for Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). The stock is 68% below its September 2021 closing high of $821 and could be among the greatest comeback stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main concern has been decelerating broadband subscriber growth amid increasing competition. Notably, subscriber growth has slowed to a low single-digit rate. However, the broadband provider has been able to push low single-digit price increases on its customers. Moreover, it’s experiencing record-low churn even with these price hikes.\n\nOne of Charter’s strengths has been its reliable free cash flow generation. With low single-digit subscriber growth and price increases, the firm can continue to grow revenue and cash flow. Broadband is still a utility in many households, and Charter is well-positioned as the largest cable TV provider, with 30.6 million residential and internet customers.\n\nOver the long term, Charter’s broadband customers will grow, supported by the growth of the housing market and rural construction. At today’s price, you are paying a forward P/E of 8 and a double-digit free cash flow yield. Going forward, it can grow earnings at a mid-teens rate, offering upside.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is mainly known for its game and metaverse development engine. Over the past year, managerial missteps, especially the controversial new fee policy, led to the stock’s implosion. However, due to its moat in mobile game development, it’s among the comeback stocks with massive potential.\n\nAmong mobile game developers, the Unity development toolkit is almost irreplaceable. After all, for a developer to switch to another platform, they must learn a new language. That means it has high switching costs since developers are unwilling to move and start from scratch.\n\nConsidering Unity is essential to the gaming industry, restructuring the business could reignite the stock. Interim CEO Jim Whitehurst is leading a strategic overhaul to deliver a leaner cost structure and better margin profile. In January, the company reduced its workforce by 25%, cutting 1,800 workers.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s price changes led to 18% growth in the subscription business excluding China in Q4 2023. Management is optimistic that the new pricing changes and cost cuts will yield results. They expect revenues to accelerate in the second half of 2024 and margin improvements going forward.\n\nThese improvements, coupled with opportunities in advertising and XR headsets, spell substantial upside for U stock. Buy the stock before the turnaround takes shape.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimates",
        "content": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe company reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million) compared to a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven driven by share price appreciation during the quarter.\"\n\nThe audio giant also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also noted that Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 6% higher in pre-market trading following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion)— 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nStory continues\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Customers with a registered EBT card can experience the same grocery subscription benefits without a Prime membership for just $4.99 per month. A free 30-day trial is available so customers can see how this grocery delivery subscription works for them.\n\n\"This new grocery subscription benefit provides even more value and savings on delivery fees for customers who regularly order groceries from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and the variety of local grocery and specialty retailers on Amazon.com,\" said Tony Hoggett, senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores at Amazon. \"Our goal is to build a best-in-class grocery shopping experience—whether shopping in-store or online—where Amazon is the first choice for selection, value, and convenience. We have many different customers with many different needs, and we want to save them time and money every time they shop for groceries.\"\n\nFor customers who prefer to purchase their groceries more regularly—whether ordering delivery or pickup—this new grocery benefit will save them even more time and money on Amazon’s vast selection of nearly 100,000 grocery items across Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and local grocery and specialty retailers. Here are the details:\n\nStory continues\n\nFor $9.99 per month, Prime members in more than 3,500 cities and towns across the U.S. have access to unlimited grocery delivery on orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and the variety of local grocery and specialty retailers available on Amazon.com. Prime members who subscribe to the new grocery delivery subscription benefit will also continue to enjoy exclusive savings in Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market stores—on top of all the other savings, convenience, and entertainment that come with Prime—in one single membership. As part of Amazon's work to help low-income customers more affordably shop for groceries, customers with a registered EBT card can receive a discounted subscription fee of $4.99 per month to receive the grocery delivery subscription without a Prime membership. Subscribers will also have access to unlimited delivery for orders over $35 from local grocery and specialty retailers like Cardenas Markets, Save Mart, Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid, Pet Food Express, Mission Wine & Spirits, and more where available. Grocery delivery subscribers receive convenient delivery and pickup time slots for grocery orders from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh. This includes one-hour delivery windows at no extra cost where available, unlimited 30-minute pickup on orders of any size, and priority access to Recurring Reservations for their weekly grocery order. The subscription pays for itself in as little as one delivery order per month from Whole Foods Market, or one delivery order per month from Amazon Fresh for under $50.\n\nAmazon piloted its grocery subscription with Prime members in Columbus, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; and Sacramento, California, in late 2023. In a recent survey of grocery subscribers from the pilot, more than 85% of respondents shared that they are extremely or very satisfied with the unlimited free delivery benefit. Some of the top reasons customers shared for staying a subscriber following the trial were saving money on delivery fees and the service making their grocery shopping experience more convenient.\n\nPrime members and customers with a registered EBT card can learn more about how Amazon is making grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable through the grocery subscription benefit, and sign up here.\n\nPrime members who shop at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market can score exclusive deals both online and in-store. Eligible Prime members can earn unlimited 5% back on their purchases when using their Prime Visa online at Amazon.com, or when shopping online or in-store at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market.\n\nAmazon is continually innovating to provide customers with great selection, value, and convenience in groceries and every day essentials, both online and in physical stores. With its portfolio of offerings, including Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go, Amazon offers a broad range of brands and shopping options for all customers—with extra benefits for Prime members. In addition to its own stores, Amazon partners with grocery and specialty retailers globally, enabling customers to order delivery from their favorite stores through Amazon’s website.\n\nAbout Amazon\n\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

        "title": "Prediction: This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Will Be the Biggest Winner of the AI Boom",
        "content": "Investors are flocking to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks these days because of the technology's potential to make companies more efficient and even transform certain industries. The idea is to identify tomorrow's winners today so that you can get in early and benefit from the growth to come. The AI market is expected to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade, so the opportunity for companies and investors could be vast.\n\nThe good news is that many companies are likely to thrive, thanks to AI, which should boost their earnings and, eventually, their share prices, too. But one company in particular is positioned to potentially benefit more than any other. It's a member of the elite group of technology stocks dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a reference to the 1960 Western.\n\nI predict that this stock will be the biggest winner of the AI boom over the long run. Let's take a closer look at the player that could score a win for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn e-commerce and cloud computing leader\n\nWhen you think of AI, you may immediately think of the chipmakers that power these platforms. Many of them make great buys and are likely to excel in the near term, as well as the long term. But the company I expect to win the most uses AI to improve its own operations and sells AI tools to others. I'm talking about e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nOver time, Amazon has built a vast fulfillment network, even doubling its size during the earlier stages of the pandemic to meet demand for essentials and general merchandise. The company uses AI in various ways to achieve efficiency and please the customer.\n\nFor example, Amazon's robotics team is building foundation AI models to manage logistic challenges in its facilities. The company already uses AI for tasks like determining the fastest delivery routes -- and this helps lower the cost to serve.\n\nIf you shop on Amazon, you're probably familiar with another Amazon AI effort -- the use of AI to present you with product suggestions based on your buying history.\n\nThese are just a few examples that should help the company lower costs over time and boost earnings. So Amazon may gain directly from applying AI to its operations.\n\nAWS chips and Nvidia chips\n\nBut that's not all. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business and biggest profit driver, sells AI products and tools to its customers. AWS offers its own innovations, like training and inference chips for the cost-conscious client, as well as AI products and services from chip leaders like Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS has something for everyone. This includes basics, like compute for customers interested in launching their own large language models (LLMs), to a fully managed service that allows customers to customize already existing LLMs from top providers.\n\nFinally, Amazon is involved in applications, too, with the goal of building generative AI apps across all of the company's consumer businesses. Examples include the new Rufus AI-powered shopping assistant and tools to help advertisers design their campaigns.\n\nAmazon's position as the world's leading cloud services company gives it a significant advantage: its huge audience. Customers are unlikely to go elsewhere with AI projects when they already use AWS. Considering AWS' broad range of products and services, customers are likely to find what they need there.\n\nA track record of growth\n\nAmazon has a proven track record of earnings growth, along with growth in return on invested capital, showing it has invested wisely over time. AMZN Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe company also has shown it could quickly recover and grow after times of difficulty. We saw this over the past couple of years when higher interest rates weighed on earnings, but Amazon revamped its cost structure and returned to earnings growth.\n\nAmazon is well positioned to invest in AI and benefit in the two ways mentioned above from this transformational technology, spurring a whole new growth story for the company down the road. I predict Amazon will be the biggest winner of the potential AI revolution, so investing in this top stock now could be a fantastic move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Is Hands Down My Pick for the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Right Now. (Hint: It's Not Nvidia.)",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), no other companies come close to the attention paid to the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Indeed, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are all helping shape the AI narrative in their own ways.\n\nWhile Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Tesla's self-driving cars are impressive, there is a different Magnificent Seven member that stands above the rest.\n\nI see Amazon as the best AI opportunity among mega-cap tech. Here's why its long-term picture looks as good as ever.\n\nAmazon has mountains of cash...\n\nThe last couple of years have been challenging for technology businesses in particular. Unusually high inflation led the Federal Reserve to enact nearly a dozen interest rate hikes.\n\nThe combination of inflation and rising interest rates caused consumers and businesses to curb spending. This significantly affected Amazon, which derives sales and profits primarily from its e-commerce and cloud computing operations.\n\nBut in 2023, things started to turn around for Amazon. Inflation cooled down a bit, which helped ignite some increased economic activity.\n\nThe company's revenue from e-commerce, advertising, and subscription services comes from its North American and International segments. During 2023, revenue between these two segments increased 11% year over year to $484 billion. But more importantly, the company generated positive operating income for these two segments.\n\nIn 2023, the company's North America and International operations combined for $12.3 billion of operating income. These two segments lost a combined $10.5 billion in 2022.\n\nBesides e-commerce and advertising, one of the company's crown jewels is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Revenue for AWS soared 13% year over year in 2023 to $90.7 billion, and it accounts for nearly 67% of the company's total operating profit.\n\nThis underscores how important it is to derive growth from cloud software. As demand for AI applications rise, AWS will play a crucial role in Amazon's longer-term growth.\n\nThe combination of increased sales and a return to positive operating income helped to accelerate free cash flow (FCF). Last year, the company generated $36.8 billion of FCF; in 2022, FCF was negative $11.6 billion.\n\nWith $86 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, Amazon seems prepared to thrive in the fiercely competitive AI realm, and it's attracting high-profile investors like Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\n...and it's not afraid to use it\n\nMicrosoft kicked off the AI revolution following its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. So far, it has deeply integrated ChatGPT throughout its Azure cloud platform in an effort to gain an edge on AWS.\n\nBut Amazon responded swiftly with a $4 billion investment with Anthropic, a start-up co-founded by former OpenAI employees. The primary aim of the investment is to unlock new opportunities in the cloud.\n\nAs part of the deal, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider and will train future generative AI models with Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips.\n\nThese are important developments that investors should not overlook. Amazon's ambitions in the chip space could prove lucrative in the long run as companies look to diversify beyond Nvidia's semiconductors. And by leveraging AWS, Anthropic should be a unique source of generating leads for Amazon's cloud platform.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Amazon stock?\n\nThe chart below compares Amazon to its Magnificent Seven peers on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. With a P/S of just 3.3, Amazon is the lowest-valued stock among the seven based on that metric. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nTaking this a step further, Amazon's current P/S is well below its 10-year high of 5.6, which it reached just a couple of years ago. I think there are a couple of factors at play here.\n\nFor starters, I think Amazon's investment in Anthropic is overlooked in comparison to Microsoft's deal with OpenAI. Moreover, the economy has been plagued by inflation and rising interest rates over the last couple of years, so I think some investors have soured on Amazon given its high degree of sensitivity to the macro environment. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nAMZN PS ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAlthough each of those points has merit, they are shortsighted arguments.\n\nThere are very few companies that can leverage AI across a host of growth markets including e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, streaming, and subscription services. Given Amazon's sustained profitability and strong cash position, I see the company emerging as a long-term winner as secular AI themes play out.\n\nThe AI story is just beginning, and Amazon is in an incredible position to dominate with its prolific ecosystem. The company's currently discounted valuation compared to its peers makes now a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares and prepare to hold for the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

That city, which is northeast of Stockton, will still have access to other types of deliveries, per the tech giant.

        "title": "The SaaS Surge: 3 Unstoppable Stocks to Propel Your Portfolio to New Heights",
        "content": "Software stocks have generally on a big roll since late last year. Indeed, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (BATS:IGV) climbed 20% between Oct. 27 and April 19. And, overall in 2023 it soared 59%. Moreover, as of February 2024, Investor’s Business Daily ranked its enterprise services software sector 14th out of its 197 sectors. And within the software space, I’ve noticed that a majority of the most successful firms are those which enable their customers to pay monthly subscriptions for their products. Such companies are known as software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers. Here are three unstoppable SaaS stocks for investors to buy now.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) recently announced that it would begin selling cloud transformation tools through Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud infrastructure unit, AWS. NOW says that its offerings will enable faster migration to the cloud and easier management of cloud workloads. According to the well-respected tech research firm, Gartner, 70% of workloads will be in the cloud by 2028, compared with 25% last year. By offering cloud transformation products, NOW should be able to better exploit the trend going forward.\n\nMoreover, NOW also disclosed that it would also provide a next-generation contact center solution through AWS. It will utilize AI and enable customers to be effectively served by NOW’s top-notch automatic tools. As a result, firms that utilize this tool will reduce the amount of money they spend on customer-service representatives while lowering their costs. With many small-and-medium businesses looking to incorporate AI into their customer service offerings to save money, I believe that NOW will be able to generate a great deal of revenue and profits from this initiative.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTyler Technologies (TYL) Tyler Technologies (TYL) logo on the website homepage.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT/ Shutterstock.com\n\nTyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is one of the SaaS stocks that specializes in providing products to the public sector. The renowned research firm Morningstar reported that they view TYL as the clear leader in the public service software market. The firm expects TYL to get a lift from efforts by local governments to update their management software. And it named TYL as one of nine “undervalued software stocks.”\n\nIn the first quarter, Tyler’s top-line climbed 6.3% versus the same period a year earlier to $481 million. Meanwhile its subscription revenue jumped 11.4% year-over-year (YoY) to $286 million. And its net income, excluding certain items, soared by an impressive 15.6% YoY.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn its Q4 earnings call, TYL reported that it was reducing its costs by transitioning an increasing number of its customers to the cloud. For the first time, the firm was able to convince a number of its public safety customers to transition to SaaS offerings and convince a meaningful number of new customers in the sector to adopt such products.\n\nAppLovin (APP) The AppLovin (APP) info on an iPhone and laptop screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) generates revenue from both mobile app developers and marketers. It does so by creating matches between marketers who want to show ads on apps and app developers.\n\nFor advertisers, the company offers a SaaS mobile marketing platform called Adjust.

        "title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Magnificent 7 ETFs Before Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNvidia NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of Nvidia fell 13.6% last week and are down sharply, about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion. The electric car maker posted the worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued its slump in the second quarter as well.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon AMZN shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. Overall, first-quarter earnings for \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nProfits for the \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAmong the group of companies, Tesla is set to report first on Apr 23, followed by Meta Platforms on Apr 24.

        "title": "Spotify earnings preview: Investors eye potential price hikes with profits in focus",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Wall Street expects the music streamer to swing to a profit on an adjusted basis as the company continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\n\"The hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call in February.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\"\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from the upcoming report, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.61 billion euros versus 3.04 billion euros in Q1 2023 Adjusted earnings per share: 0.65 euros versus adjusted loss of 1.16 euros in Q1 2023 Total monthly active users (MAUs): 618 million versus 515 million in Q1 2023 Premium subscribers: 239 million versus 210 million in Q1 2023\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\n\"Podcast margins were near breakeven in 4Q23, and management commentary signaled that margins are likely to positively inflect and drive profitability through 2024,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note on Friday ahead of the results.\n\nNollen maintained his Outperform rating on shares but raised his price target to $330 from $300 \"given the continued focus on profitability.\"\n\nSpotify guided to gross margins of 26.4% in Q1 after the metric came in at 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Over the long term, Spotify expects gross margins between 30% and 35% amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\n\"We think the change is welcome given Spotify's renewed focus on profitability,\" Nollen said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The magnificent 7 stocks — Tesla TSLA, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and NVIDIA NVDA — are set to report their quarterly results in a few days.\r\n\r\nThese megacap stocks were the top performers in 2023 and have continued to outperform the market except for Apple and Tesla, shares of which have declined 14.3% and 40.8%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, MSFT, META, NVDA, AMZN and GOOGL have returned 6.2%, 35.9%, 53.9%, 15% and 10.3%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the magnificent 7 have continued to dominate the S&P 500 with a weightage of 29.7% as of Apr 17, per Datatrek research, as cited by Investors’ Business Daily.

This marked the first year-over-year drop in quarterly deliveries since 2020.\r\n\r\nThe decline was due to “the early phase of the production ramp-up” of its updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory and plant shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, which led to a weeklong production halt in its Germany factory.

        "title": "Why the Magnificent 7's 'momentum is collapsing'",
        "content": "The run may be over for the seven stocks that drove the lion's share of the stock market rally over the past year.\n\nUBS Investment Bank Chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub downgraded six of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) — from Overweight to Neutral in a new research note on Monday.\n\nHis call comes as the Magnificent 7, whichalso includes Tesla (TSLA), just had its largest weekly market cap loss in history. All seven of the big tech leaders are off their recent highs, as highlighted by a 10% single day-drawdown for Nvidia, its worst one day price performance since March 2020.\n\nGolub, who rates sectors within the S&P 500 (^GSPC) not individual stocks, remains Overweight on technology outside of the six stocks he names in his note. But for the large companies who have grown earnings significantly over the past year, Golub believes the tide may be shifting, and other areas are set to outperform the largest stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Investors attribute the run in mega cap stocks to animal spirits and the impact of AI,\" Golub wrote. \"However, our work indicates that surging earnings momentum (change in forward growth projections) fueled this upside. Unfortunately, this momentum is collapsing.\"\n\nTesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nEarnings for the S&P 500 have largely been driven by earnings growth in the large tech stocks. That's expected to play out again during first quarter reports, with FactSet projecting Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia to combine for earnings growth of roughly 64%. Meanwhile the other 495 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report an earnings decline of 6%.\n\nBut over the course of the year, this is expected to shift. Consensus estimates from FactSet show earnings for those five companies are set to end the year with just shy of 20% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly slower growth than their prior pace. By that point, consensus expects the other 495 companies to be growing earnings by about 17% compared to the year prior, a significant uptick from their current growth rate.\n\n\"Our downgrade of the Big 6—from Overweight to Neutral—is not predicated on extended valuations, or doubts about AI,\" Golub wrote. \"Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks. These forces do not apply to other TECH+ companies or the rest of the market in the same way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift in where earnings are growing the most could be \"disruptive in the near term,\" Golub said. But given increasing signs that the US economy is growing faster-than-expected this year, Golub thinks a broadening out in earnings performance over the next year keeps his 5,400 call on the S&P 500 to end the 2024 in play.\n\n\"This target remains supported by broadly positive fundamentals and a robust economy,\" Golub wrote.

        "title": "3 Stocks Most at Risk of AI’s Alarming Energy Consumption",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a Bitcoin (USD-BTC) moment and the situation could rapidly deteriorate for some of the biggest companies in this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBitcoin miners are energy intensive. Their thousands of computers generate excess heat that must be cooled and dissipated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates miners consume as much as 2.3% of all electricity produced in the U.S. It threatened to cause the segment to crash because of the rising costs. AI is in a similar situation but it could mushroom exponentially very fast.\n\nIn 2021, before the real explosion of AI, the EIA said data centers, one of the biggest AI users, were consuming about 2% of all the electricity produced. It noted they are “one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd AI is an energy hog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2026, or “roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S. alone, Boston Consulting Group estimates AI-powered data centers will consume as much as 7.5% of electric output by 2030, triple what it was in 2022.\n\nThe energy crisis is real because there is not enough capacity available to meet projected demand. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest data center operators for its cloud services business. CEO Andy Jassy told Fortune, “These large language models are so power hungry, and there’s just not enough energy right now.” The e-commerce giant recently purchased a nuclear-powered data center to help offset its electricity demands.\n\nAmazon operates 125 data centers globally but just 24 in the U.S. Below are three other giant data center operators at risk because of AI’s alarming energy consumption.\n\nEquinix (EQIX) corporate building with Equinix (EQIX) logo on it\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates 260 data centers in 71 major metropolitan areas around the globe. It understands the all-consuming nature of artificial intelligence in data centers. Equinix has been using AI-based software to reduce by 9% energy consumption at a Frankfurt data center and plans to roll it out to its other Frankfurt data centers. It was an essential response as Germany introduced an aggressive new law to increase energy efficiency.\n\nIf it wants to fulfill its expansion dreams, Equinix will need to deploy similar strategies elsewhere. The REIT wants to build out its xScale data centers for hyperscale usage. Hyperscalers are supersized cloud services providers like Amazon and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. These are the biggest drivers of AI demand as they seek out AI accelerators to boost their capacity. Google says its AI accounts for almost 15% of its data centers’ energy usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithout money-saving initiatives like this, Equinix could find itself pinched by growing demand of its xScale facilities.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it’s understood Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) need for data centers for its fast-growing Azure cloud service, what might not be as apparent is just how many the tech giant owns and operates itself.\n\nAccording to industry site Dgtl Infra, Microsoft operates 300 physical data centers in 64 regions globally. It is in the process of adding 15 more regions to its constellation, with each region having from one to three individual data centers. Together, Microsoft’s data centers span over 75 million square feet.\n\nMicrosoft needs this web of connectivity as it is one of the most prominent companies diving head-first into AI. Beyond the scalability AI provides Azure, the tech stock has integrated it throughout all of its products and services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, LinkedIn, Skype, Xbox and Outlook.\n\nBecause every facet of Microsoft’s business is tied to AI, the power demands it places on the grid are excessive. It also hints at the next pain point for AI: water consumption, an equally scarce resource. Google’s data centers used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 while Microsoft’s water usage soared 34%.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is the world’s largest data center REIT with 308 locations in 25 countries. As companies continue to transition their data to the cloud, they increasingly turn to DLR to house it. Among its biggest customers are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and hyperscaler Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAs much of the problem as AI is, Digital Realty sees it also being part of the solution. DLR says AI can measure and reduce consumption significantly by intuitively deploying resources at appropriate times. In a 2019 pilot program using its Apollo AI platform, DLR tested conservation methods at two European facilities. It rolled it out to 14 more soon after. Combined, Digital Realty was able to save about 18 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of savings.\n\nThe REIT offers hope that even as AI drives immense demand on energy resources, it can offset that by increasing efficiency. But whether that is possible on a global scale as AI usage increases exponentially remains to be seen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Put $5,000 in These 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Today",
        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability in a crazed market, jump into safer blue-chip stocks.\n\nWhile they’re not all the most exciting stocks on the market, they have proven themselves to be ultra-reliable in any economic environment. They all have proven business models, strong track records, sales, reputations and oftentimes, dividends to boot. That’s because most offer products and services that millions of us use every day.\n\nEven better, after a recent pullback in the broader markets, some of the top blue-chip stocks are on sale. Look at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After testing a high of $17.59, it pulled back to $16.33, where it caught support and is just starting to pivot higher. Plus, it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, which tells us it’s overdue to bounce. And while you wait for the AT&T stock to recover, you can collect its yield of 6.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven more top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold today.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) gapped from about $100 to a low of $88.80. However, it’s starting to pivot higher, and could soon refill that gap at around $100. Helping, Bank of America analysts just upgraded the NKE stock to a buy rating with a price target of $113. The firm argues NKE has a newer line up of footwear and apparel products. Plus, the upcoming Olympics should have a positive impact on the stock, too.\n\nJPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $164. The firm pointed to Nike’s improvement in China. In addition, Morgan Stanley says retailers are seeing improving sequential demand trends for athletic apparel.\n\nBetter, earnings negativity has been priced into the stock. Investors weren’t too enthused when the company said growth was near zero, or that management expected for revenue to pull back in the first half of fiscal 2025, which starts in June. But again, that appears to be priced in.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere’s also “The Monthly Dividend Company,” Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nWith a yield of 5.93%, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is also a buy on weakness. In fact, after slipping from $54.39 to $50.65, it’s now starting to pivot higher again. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its monthly dividend. Its latest one for 25.7 cents is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. This is the company’s 646th consecutive monthly dividend with many more on the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income has been around for more than 50 years now. It has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nSome of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few. It’s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) Fidelity sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund, such as the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF “focuses on companies we believe have above-average earnings growth potential with sustainable business models, for which the market has mispriced the rate and/or durability of growth,” as noted by Fidelity.\n\nTop holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to name a few.\n\nEven more impressive, since bottoming out at around $27 in late October, the ETF hit a high of about $39. It just recently pulled back with the broader market to $36.84. Now oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, that weakness is an opportunity. From its current price of $36.84, I’d like to see the ETF challenge $40 a share initially.\n\nWhat’s nice about an ETF like this one is we can diversify with top blue-chip stocks. All for less than $37 a share at the moment.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG) vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot blue-chip ETF to consider is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VIG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06%, the VIG ETF currently yields 1.76%. its last payout of 76.92 cents was paid on March 27. The next one should be out by June. It also holds 340 stocks, including Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). All in its effort to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $150, the VIG ETF ran to a high of $183.02. Since then, it has dipped to $173.63, where it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price, I’d like to see it initially retest $182.07 and head to $200 near term.\n\nWhat’s nice about this ETF is we can gain exposure to 340 of the world’s top stocks. All for less than $175 a share at the moment. Plus, we can collect its yield as it appreciates.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which we’re all familiar with.\n\nWith a yield of 2.56%, the consumer goods company is also a buy on recent weakness. After pulling back from about $160, it’s now technically oversold at $157.29. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R and is just starting to pivot higher. Initially, I’d like to see the PG stock retest its prior high and push to at least $170 near term.\n\nIt also just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.0065, a 7% jump from its prior dividend of 94.07 cents. It’s payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 19.\n\nHelping, Barclays just reiterated a buy rating on the PG stock with a price target of $168. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also raised their price target to $172 with a buy rating. The firm says “year-to-date consumption trends for Procter remain solid in tracked channels. The firm sees little risk to near-term earnings numbers given the company’s ongoing productivity momentum and relative cost favorability,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) An angled side view of a row of parked cars. automotive stock picks\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), it traded at $135 on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “Use the weakness as an opportunity. While we wait for the eventual recovery here, we can collect its 2.76% yield. We can profit from capital appreciation, and get paid to wait.” Just a few months later, GPC is now up to $160.23 and could see higher highs.\n\nNow yielding 2.5%, the stock rocketed 11.2% higher on Thursday after raising its fiscal year 2024 profit guidance. For the year, it expected to post EPS of $8.95 to $9.15. Now it expects to post EPS of $9.05 to $.9.20, which boosted investor confidence.\n\nEven better, its dividend – which has been increased consistently for 67 years – is safe. In the first three months of 2024, the company said it “used $175 million in cash for financing activities, including $133 million for quarterly dividends paid to shareholders and $38 million for stock repurchases. Free cash flow was $203 million.”\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks good on weakness, too.\n\nAfter dropping to $58.18 from $61, it’s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. But it is starting to bounce back fast. From its last traded price of $58.91, I’d like to see it retest $61. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its yield of about 3.3%. Its latest dividend of 48.5 cents was recently paid out on April 1. Annualized, it’s $1.94 and is the company’s 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nPlus, “The company returned $8 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2023, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to shareowners since Jan. 1, 2010, to $84.7 billion,” as noted in a recent press release. Helping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on KO to $68 with an overweight rating.

        "title": "It's Time to Ditch These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks and Replace Them With 2 Bona Fide Outperformers",
        "content": "Within the past couple of weeks, all three major stock indexes powered their way to fresh record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that are widely credited with lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to new heights.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, as the name implies, are seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. These seven components are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from crushing the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing-10-year period, the Magnificent Seven have undeniable competitive advantages. Examples include:\n\nNvidia controlling upwards of 90% of all graphics processing units deployed in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated enterprise data centers. Amazon being the leader in U.S. e-commerce retail market share and global cloud infrastructure service spend (via Amazon Web Services). Alphabet's Google accounting for an estimated 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, per GlobalStats.\n\nBut not all of the Magnificent Seven components are ultimately \"magnificent.\" To be brutally honest, some have been nothing short of operating duds over the past year. What follows are two Magnificent Seven stocks that should be sent to the chopping block, as well as the two phenomenal businesses that can logically replace them.\n\nIt's time to ditch this Magnificent Seven component: Tesla\n\nAs I stated plainly in late February, the Tesla growth story is officially dead. While the company has amassed a healthy cash pile to navigate a turbulent market for electric vehicles (EVs), and it's driven its first-mover advantages to four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, Tesla is a shell of what it was once advertised to be.\n\nTo begin with, the company has been aggressively reducing the sales price of Model's 3, S, X, and Y since the start of 2023. Between Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023, Tesla's operating margin was more-than-halved to 8.2%. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that EV demand dictates his company's pricing strategy. Yet even with aggressive price cuts, inventory levels have been stubbornly climbing.\n\nAnother issue with Tesla is that its efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many EV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has stalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-digits. Tesla's sales and profitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs -- and that's a segment that's under serious pressure right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've highlighted in the past, Tesla also generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources that include interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. This makes the company's premium valuation all the more egregious.\n\nTesla is an auto company losing its first-mover advantages that, in my view, has no business being viewed as a Magnificent Seven component. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt's also time to put this Magnificent Seven constituent out to pasture: Apple\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven stock that should be given the proverbial heave-ho is tech titan Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple's iPhone still dominates in the U.S., and the company's subscription-powered Services segment has been its most-consistent performer for years. Further, the $651 billion in share repurchases Apple has undertaken since the start of 2013 is tops among all public companies. A steady diet of buybacks has provided a boost to Apple's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe concern with Apple is that its growth engine has completely stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended in late September), sales declined in all of Apple's physical product segments. Through the first three months of fiscal 2024, iPad and Wearables generated double-digit percentage sales declines from the prior-year period.\n\nTo make matters worse, preliminary research data released from IDC last week shows that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by 9.6% to 50.1 million units from the previous year. iPhone is the company's top revenue driver.\n\nWhen Apple was valued at 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings, no one batted an eye if the company endured a growth hiccup. But at 27 times forecast EPS for the current fiscal year, a second consecutive year of zero or negative growth is too much of an eyesore to sweep under the rug.\n\nApple's best growth days may well be in the rearview mirror -- and for that reason, it no longer belongs in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe first outperformer that deserves its spot among the Magnificent Seven: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIf Tesla and Apple are shown the door, the first no-brainer company that should be viewed as a true Magnificent Seven component is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nWhile it's true that Berkshire isn't an innovator in the same capacity as either Tesla or Apple, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team have led Berkshire to virtually unmatched annualized returns dating back more than a half-century. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500.\n\nThree catalysts continue to make Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders richer over time. First off, Buffett and his team have a lengthy track record of generating big-time returns in the stock market. Berkshire's $361 billion investment portfolio contains 45 stocks and two index funds, with a heavy concentration in just four stocks (one of which happens to be Apple).\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly five dozen businesses, which have helped grow its operating revenue and income. Some of Berkshire's fully owned subsidiaries include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF. A portfolio weighted heavily to cyclical businesses gets to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe third reason Berkshire's stock keeps climbing is because Warren Buffett has given the green light to more than $74 billion worth of share buybacks since July 2018. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire's EPS and making its stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused long-term investors.\n\nA second outperformer that's proven it's magnificent: Visa\n\nThe other outstanding company that makes for a logical replacement for Tesla or Apple in the Magnificent Seven is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, you could certainly argue that Tesla and Apple are more innovative than Visa. But few companies have delivered for their shareholders on a more consistent basis than Visa has since its initial public offering in March 2008.\n\nIn the U.S., no payment processor accounts for a higher share of credit card network purchase volume than Visa. It was also the only payment facilitator in the U.S. that gained substantial share following the Great Recession. Since economic expansions last substantially longer than recessions, Visa benefits from the disproportionate long-term growth in spending from consumers and businesses.\n\nIt also has a lengthy growth runway beyond domestic borders. Emerging market regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia remain underbanked. Visa has the ability to organically expand its infrastructure into these markets, as well as quickly reach new regions by making acquisitions, just as it did in 2016 when it acquired Visa Europe.\n\nBest of all, Visa's management team has steered clear of becoming a lender. This strategic move ensures that it won't have to set aside capital during inevitable recessions to deal with credit delinquencies and loan losses. This is a competitive edge that's helped Visa maintain a juicy profit margin north of 50%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Recently More Than Doubled His Holdings of These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giants.",
        "content": "Stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" have attracted investors' attention in recent times -- and that includes the attention of some of the world's most successful investors. The perfect example is billionaire Ken Griffin, who, through his Citadel hedge fund, holds shares of all of these top technology stocks.\n\nThere's reason to pay close attention to the stocks Griffin is buying because he clearly has made many winning bets -- so you could win by following some of his moves. As the best-performing hedge fund ever, Citadel has generated about $74 billion in gains over time for investors. And last year, Citadel brought in more than $8 billion, prompting LCH Investments to name the money manager among 2023's top performers.\n\nMost recently, Griffin has more than doubled his holdings of two Magnificent Seven stocks, players that both are investing heavily in AI and could emerge as winners in an eventual AI revolution. Let's check out these Griffin buys that could boost your portfolio too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, Griffin's Citadel increased its position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) by 127%, adding more than 1 million shares. Now you may not immediately think of AI when you think of Meta. After all, the company owns Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, making it a social media giant. And thanks to this leadership, it generates the lion's share of its revenue by selling advertising across these platforms.\n\nBut AI is progressively becoming more and more a part of Meta's business, with the company aiming to include the technology in all of its products and services. For now, you can get a taste of this thanks to Meta's launch of the Meta AI conversational assistant in beta version across apps in certain geographies. By making AI an integral part of the social media experience, Meta may keep users on its apps longer -- and this could encourage advertisers to keep spending on these platforms to reach their target audiences.\n\nMeta has made AI its investment focus this year and plans to bring on 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) of compute by the end of the year. The company also aims to become a leader in AI, open sourcing its large language model (LLM) Llama so that Meta's platform may one day be the industry standard.\n\nAll of this means now is a great time to follow Griffin into Meta, a company with a solid earnings track record and revenue source -- and potential to win in the AI market over time.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nCitadel lifted its position in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock by 227% in the fourth quarter, buying more than 4 million shares. The hedge fund has thousands of holdings, but Amazon is its fourth-biggest position, so it's fair to say this player is one of Citadel's favorites. And for good reason. Amazon could benefit from AI in two ways and both might supercharge earnings over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, Amazon itself is using AI to become more efficient and lower its cost to serve. For example, in e-commerce AI helps Amazon determine the fastest delivery routes for package delivery -- this reduces travel time and therefore cost. Amazon also is using AI to help customers find just the right items, and this is likely to keep them coming back.\n\nSecond, Amazon's cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- sells AI chips and related products and services to customers. And here, Amazon could win big. AWS is the world's biggest cloud company, meaning it has access to an enormous client base. And it's likely that these AWS clients will stick with the cloud provider for AI projects rather than going elsewhere.\n\nAWS is going all in on AI, offering not only chips but also a fully managed service that gives customers access to popular LLMs that they can customize for their own purposes. This means AWS may serve a broad range of AI customers.\n\nAll of this should help Amazon -- already a leader in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud -- benefit from the explosive growth area of AI. And that's why right now is the perfect time to get in on this Ken Griffin stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Re-vote on Elon Musk’s pay could expose Tesla to even more legal trouble",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is likely in for some fresh legal entanglements after recommending stockholders vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk’s multi-billion-dollar compensation package — no matter what the final tally reveals at the company's June annual meeting.\n\n\"I think regardless of whether the vote is approved or not, it's going to be challenged in the Delaware courts,\" said Marc Steinberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law.\n\nBecause of the billions at stake, \"chances are you're going to attract shareholder derivative and class-action type lawsuits,\" added Jerry Comizio, a business law professor at American University's Washington College of Law. Tesla CEO Elon Musk. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMusk's pay was struck down in January by a Delaware judge who found that Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty when they awarded Musk the largest compensation opportunity ever granted to a public company executive. The ruling came after a shareholder sued to challenge the pay package.\n\nMusk's incentive-based pay, had it not been invalidated by the Delaware court, would now be worth roughly $47 billion following a fall in the value of Tesla’s stock. At the time of the ruling it had been worth up to $56 billion.\n\nTesla used a preliminary proxy filing last week to ask shareholders to re-vote on this pay package, arguing it had cured the conditions that led Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to void Musk’s compensation in January.\n\nIt did so, the board claimed, by forming a single-member special committee to evaluate Musk's pay package using independent director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson — and by following Wilson-Thompson's recommendation for a new shareholder vote that came after third parties assisted the company with \"rigorous and thoughtful analysis.\"\n\nMcCormick threw out Musk’s pay because of what she called \"extensive ties\" between Musk and the people negotiating the pay package and a lack of public disclosure about Musk’s relationships with those who approved the deal. In this courtroom sketch Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left, testifies before Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, seated right, in 2022. A stenographer is seated at center. (Elizabeth Williams via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company is separately asking its shareholders to approve a move of Tesla’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas — a move called for by Musk after the Delaware judge voided his pay.\n\n\"2024 is the year that Tesla should move home to Texas,\" Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm said in her letter to shareholders included in the proxy statement.\n\nThe re-authorization of Musk's pay, Tesla argued to shareholders in its new filing, is needed to incentivize Musk’s future leadership of Tesla.\n\n\"Because the Delaware court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,\" the company said in its filing.\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal experts said those arguments might not be enough to keep shareholders from suing Tesla and the board all over again, arguing that the sole director who approved it was not independent enough from Musk. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm. (Photo by Alex Ellinghausen/Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images) (Fairfax Media via Getty Images)\n\nShareholders could also argue that the company's disclosures around the deal still fell short.\n\nComizio cautions that a company's analysis of executive compensation typically involves a company-initiated peer review that helps the board set CEO pay within an appropriate range, and that without it, Tesla, to its peril, may have ignored deficiencies outlined by the Delaware court.\n\n\"At minimum, they've got to revamp the whole process of how they did this,\" Comizio said.\n\n\"When you adjust somebody’s compensation…if you’re doing a graph and the proposed compensation package looks like Mount Everest, that can be problematic.\"\n\nNot all legal experts agree.\n\nGunster's corporate law expert Bob Lamm argues that Tesla may have a decent claim against that peer review standard. Historically, he said, superstar founders such as Apple’s (AAPL) Steve Jobs and Amazon’s (AMZN) Jeff Bezos have been largely exempt from that scrutiny.\n\n\"It's questionable whether there are any peers for Elon Musk,\" Lamm said. \"So looking for comparable data is going to be tough.\"\n\nMusk's compensation plan reached in 2018 was around 33 times larger than the largest pay package in history, according to Greg Varallo, the shareholders' attorney in the Delaware case. The prior record also belonged to Musk, in a compensation deal reached in 2014.\n\nThe next step in this pay drama, before final votes are tallied June 13, is a likely review of Tesla’s proxy filing by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat review could require Tesla to amend its disclosure to shareholders about Musk’s proposed pay deal, according to Comizio.\n\nAt some point, however, there are no more disclosures to be made, Lamm said.\n\nBusiness courts in Delaware and other states have wide discretion to address what they view as inequities between companies and shareholders, but they don’t have the liberty to simply object to the amount of an executive's pay.\n\n“The problem that the courts have now is that they can’t say the [compensation] is too much,” Lamm said. “And you can’t disclose everything. At some point the court’s got to say: \"Tesla, you've done your job.”\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Cheap Tech, Big Gains: 7 Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now",
        "content": "One of the golden rules in the market (and in life) is that you get what you pay for, which makes the concept of cheap tech stocks a bit questionable. Yes, they may be cheap, priced at under $10. But is that really a good thing?\n\nInvariably, when you take a shot in the market, you must choose between higher potentiality or higher predictability. The former approach is more tempting because it means more upside – if you get it right. If you don’t, you’re probably looking at steep losses. At that point, you should have went with the boring and predictable names.\n\nHowever, you likely can’t strike it rich without taking some calculated potshots. With that in mind, below are cheap tech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrab (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the application software component of cheap tech stocks, Grab (NASDAQ:GRAB) engages in the provision of super apps in compelling emerging markets. These are Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Per its public profile, the company offers its Grab ecosystem, which facilitates a wide range of services such as mobility and delivery.\n\nWhat makes GRAB very enticing is that it currently runs a three-year revenue growth rate of 72%. Further, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 37.5%. Granted, these metrics will slow as the enterprise expands. Still, at the moment, GRAB stock trades at 2.28X tangible book value, below the sector median 3.53X.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate revenue to land at $2.75 billion. That’s up 16.7% from last year’s print of $2.36 billion. In the following year, the top line could jump to $3.22 billion, up 17% from projected 2024 sales.\n\nLastly, analysts rate GRAB a unanimous strong buy with a $4.41 price target.\n\nPayoneer (PAYO) Payoneer editorial. Illustrative photo for news about Payoneer - an American financial services company.\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorking under the infrastructure software space, Payoneer (NASDAQ:PAYO) operates as a financial technology company. It operates a payment infrastructure platform that provides customers with a one-stop, global, multi-currency account to serve their accounts receivable and accounts payable needs. Given the penchant for credit-card use, PAYO could be an intriguing idea for cheap tech stocks.\n\nNotably, the company features a 27.5% three-year revenue growth rate. That’s up 83.74% of the competition. Further, PAYO appears undervalued relative to certain metrics. Right now, shares trade at only 20.21X trailing-year earnings, below the sector median 26.3X. Also, PAYO is priced at 16.82X free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts believe sales could rise to $882.83 million. That’s up 6.2% from last year’s print of $831.1 million. Also, in fiscal 2025, the company could post revenue of $968.18 million, up almost 10% against projected 2024 sales.\n\nNotably, PAYO represents another unanimous strong buy with a $6.88 average price target. The high-side target lands at $9, making it a solid choice for cheap tech stocks.\n\nHimax (HIMX) Shipping label of a box from Himax. HIMX stock.\n\nSource: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock\n\nA fabless semiconductor company, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) provides display imaging processing technologies for multiple international markets. Primarily, it offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, PC monitors, laptops, mobile phones, tablets and automotive solutions, among other categories. It’s quietly relevant, making it a solid idea for cheap tech stocks.\n\nAlong with its pertinence to the broader tech ecosystem, Himax is undervalued. Presently, HIMX trades at only 17.16X trailing-year earnings. That’s below 72.27% of sector rivals. Further, it trades at only 0.94X trailing-year sales. It doesn’t get much love although the company has a history of delivering outstanding earnings performances.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate the company to post earnings per share of 39 cents, above last year’s print of 29 cents. Now, the average sales target calls for parity with last year’s result. However, the high-side estimate calls for $1.03 billion, up from 2023’s tally of $945.43 million.\n\nAnalysts rate HIMX a moderate buy with a $7 price target.\n\nVTEX (VTEX) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother enterprise in the application software industry, VTEX (NYSE:VTEX) provides a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) digital commerce platform for enterprise brands and retailers. Per its corporate profile, VTEX enables customers to execute their commerce strategy, including building online stores, integrating and managing orders across channels and creating marketplaces to sell products from third-party vendors. Beyond its U.S. market, it serves exciting arenas in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, among others.\n\nRight now, the company is built for growth. Currently, its three-year sales expansion rate stands at 27.1%. That’s up more than 83% from the rest of the field. However, investors do pay a premium for this revenue growth. For example, VTEX trades at a trailing-year sales multiple of 6.75X, above the sector median 2.21X.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe that the company’s loss per share will land at 1 cent. That’s an improvement over last year’s loss of 7 cents. Also, revenue could hit $243.32 million, up 20.7% from 2023’s haul of $255.44 million.\n\nAnalysts peg VTEX as a moderate buy with a $10 price target. The high side goes up to $13, making it one of the cheap tech stocks to consider.\n\nStratasys (SSYS) Stratasys (SSYS) logo on a black background\n\nSource: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocused on the computer hardware segment of cheap tech stocks, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) provides connected polymer-based 3D printing solutions. According to its public profile, the company offers a range of 3D printing systems, which include polyjet printers, stereolithography printing systems and solutions for additive manufacturing, among others. Given the history of the subsector, SSYS is risky. Still, it could also attract speculators.\n\nOperationally, Stratasys has struggled for momentum. However, the company does enjoy a solid balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of 8.71X. That’s superior to 76.55% of the competition. Also, SSYS trades at a tangible book value of 1.04X. Theoretically, that means the market only prices shares at a modest premium to the sum of its parts.\n\nIt is possible that investors could regret not jumping on SSYS when they had the chance. Yes, projected fiscal 2024 revenue of $634.98 million isn’t that great compared to last year’s result of $627.6 million. However, projected 2025 sales could hit $678.46 million, up nearly 7% from forecasted 2024 revenue.\n\nAnalysts rate SSYS a consensus strong buy with a $16.40 price target. Conspicuously, the most optimistic target calls for $23 per share.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nOperating in the computer hardware subcategory, IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) engages in the development of general-purpose quantum computing systems. Per its corporate profile, IonQ sells access to quantum computers of various qubit capacities. It integrates with multiple cloud platforms, including those provided by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). With quantum computers poised to lead the next wave of processing innovation, IONQ is a compelling idea among cheap tech stocks.\n\nTo be fair, though, the company presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. On the plus side, the business enjoys a stout balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 44X. That ranks higher than 88% of its rivals. On the flipside, the valuation is steep. IONQ trades at over 68X trailing-year revenue.\n\nNevertheless, the growth projections are enticing, leading some speculators to believe that the company could grow into its premium. Experts believe fiscal 2024 revenue could hit $38.93 million, up 76.6% from last year’s result of $22.04 million. For fiscal 2025, sales could land at $81.83 million. If so, that would be up 110.2% from projected 2024 sales.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) A concept art of an astronaut with a space secene behind. Space Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the communication equipment realm, AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) develops and provides access to a space-based cellular broadband network for smartphones. According to its public profile, the company is perhaps best known for providing cellular broadband services to end-users who are out of terrestrial cellular coverage. Such capacity has significant industrial applications, along with broader connectivity relevancies.\n\nAs part of the wider space economy, ASTS has attracted significant attention. Nevertheless, it’s an incredibly risky proposition, with shares down almost 56% since the start of the year. It’s worth mentioning that without outstanding strengths in the balance sheet, AST is largely a narrative play.\n\nThat’s not to say that Wall Street experts refuse to numbers on the table. On the contrary, they anticipate fiscal 2024 revenue to hit $77.67 million. Last year, the company posted nothing on the top line. Not only that, the most optimistic target calls for sales of $155 million.\n\nFinally, analysts rate ASTS stock a unanimous strong buy with an $11.13 average price target. If the stars align, we could be looking at 420% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Opinion: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Will Be the Largest Companies in the World by 2030",
        "content": "Making long-term predictions is difficult. Who would have guessed 10 years ago that Nvidia would be one of the largest companies by market cap in the world? Very few.\n\nDespite this uncertain future, I still believe it is useful for investors to look out five to 10 years and think about what companies could be much larger than they are today. Otherwise, you are just making shots in the dark and should probably buy index funds instead.\n\nWhile not a certainty, I think \"Magnificent Seven\" giants Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be the two largest companies in the world by 2030. Here's why.\n\n1. Amazon: Put everything in the cloud\n\nAmazon's culture of innovation has allowed it to win in multiple large product categories. Most of us know it as the dominant e-commerce platform in North America, which brings in hundreds of billions in annual sales. But it is not the most profitable segment for Amazon today: That distinction goes to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide, bringing in $91 billion in revenue and just under $25 billion in operating income last year. Its major competitors are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other smaller providers, but AWS has remained the largest cloud service since its inception around two decades ago, with around 31% market share.\n\nEven though AWS is already large, there is still plenty of room for the cloud to gain market share versus legacy computing solutions. Analysts expect the industry to grow at a 19% rate through 2030. If AWS can maintain its market share and profit margin profile, that will lead to the division to grow its earnings at 19% a year and hit over $90 billion in 2030. Add in the monster e-commerce division, international expansion in places such as India, and moonshots like the Project Kuiper internet service, and I think Amazon has a good chance of being one of the two largest companies in the world by 2030.\n\n2. Alphabet: Multiple levers for growth\n\nAnd who will the other be? Well, all we need to do is look at one of Amazon's cloud computing competitors. GOOG Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and other projects like self-driving company Waymo. Google Cloud should see the same growth benefits as AWS, growing from a $36 billion annualized revenue rate at the end of 2023 to close to $100 billion in revenue by 2030. That should generate a lot of value for Alphabet, but it's not the only ace up its sleeve.\n\nFirst, we need to highlight Google Search and how much revenue it generates. The dominant search engine worldwide generated $48 billion in revenue just in the fourth quarter of 2023 and should do $200 billion in annual sales within a few years. As the key advertising engine for many industries like travel, insurance, and financial services, Google Search revenue should grow along with global GDP as more of the world starts using smartphones and the internet.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's not forget YouTube. Alphabet owns the largest video platform worldwide, which generated $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter. YouTube has billions of users around the world and is the most popular streaming video service on TVs in the United States. Yes, that is TVs in the United States, not all devices.\n\nYouTube is a growing entertainment mainstay for people around the world. I think it will be even more dominant in 2030.\n\nLast year, Alphabet generated $85.7 billion in operating earnings. With so many growth levers to pull, it seems likely that the company will continue growing its earnings over the next few years. By 2030, I think this will lead the Magnificent Seven giant to pass the likes of Apple and Microsoft and become one of the two largest companies in the world alongside Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "15 Best Places to Retire in Maryland",
        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Maryland. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Maryland.\n\nThe Trouble with Social Security\n\nIn America’s retirement landscape, a key component is Social Security. According to an AARP research study, Social Security retirement benefits impact millions of Americans across the country, allowing more than 16 million senior citizens to stay above the poverty line. Citizen sentiments are in line with this, with 71% of Americans regarding Social Security as among the most important running government initiatives.\n\nHowever, not all agree at the political level. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama recently expressed his concerns about Social Security during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing.\n\n“There's going to be about 150 million people coming up here saying, 'Where's our damn money that we paid in? I could have put my Social Security money, 40 years in tax, in [stock] the market and probably be worth $8-to-$10 million today but the federal government wasted it.”\n\n-Tommy Tuberville, Republican Senator from Alabama\n\nWhile a sum of $8 million may be a reach, there’s no hiding that the Social Security system is financially fraught. There are several reasons for this. For one, life expectancy is now longer. Go back some 90 years to 1935 - the year of the Social Security Act - and UC Berkeley reported life expectancy to stand at 63.9 and 59.9 for women and men, respectively. Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that this number has grown to 79.3 and 73.5 for women and men, respectively. These significant growths in life expectancy - while positive - means that Social Security now absorbs and requires more finances than before.\n\nIn fact, America’s Social Security system is in a state of deficit - that is, it spends more on benefits and upkeep than it receives in income via interest and taxes.\n\n“Since 2010, Social Security has paid out more in benefits and expenses than it has collected in taxes and other non-interest income.”\n\n-Mark J. Warshawsky, Former Deputy Commissioner for Retirement and Disability Policy at the Social Security Administration\n\nIn 2022, the deficit numbered $22.1 billion and this outlook is expected to be the same throughout the 75-year projection period. Over the course of this period, the total funding shortfall is estimated to reach a massive $22.4 trillion.\n\nThe Social Security Administration aside, many citizens themselves are unaware of how to maximize their Social Security benefits. Within America’s retirement discourse, there is a big information gap when it comes to Social Security. A recent AARP survey illustrated these findings. Of Americans aged 25 to 66, a sizeable 59% do not possess knowledge about the workings behind Social Security benefits. Many others are not clear on collecting benefits as the dependent spouse of a living individual, as a widower, or as a divorcee. This lack of knowledge often means that deserving individuals are not fully realizing their Social Security benefits, and instead look towards other, corporate means to make do.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, many companies in the corporate world are embracing an older workforce. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) are some of the biggest companies that are part of this movement. More specifically, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) offers a 12-week Return Flight program that is a paid, return-to-work initiative, whereas Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a 16-week paid Returnship with much the same goals.\n\nWith the uncertainty regarding Social Security and the rising costs of living, retirees are often divided into two groups - those who can afford a lavish lifestyle, and those who make do on smaller budgets. While most places are labeled welcoming to one or the other, there are some states that hold the best of both - giving each type of retiree something to look forward to. The state of Maryland, for instance, is one such example. Not only does that state pack picturesque landscapes, but it also holds a variety of towns and cities that cover all parts of the scale when it comes to the cost of living. So, whether you’re looking for a budgeted retirement or a more flexible one, you’ll find yourself saying yes to the question ‘Is Maryland a good place for retirees?’\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Maryland state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Maryland. 15 Best Places to Retire in Maryland\n\nA portrait of a confident, affluent businessperson signing a money market savings account agreement.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Maryland, we consulted several sources including our lists of 16 East Coast Cities to Retire on $3000 a Month or Less, 25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month, 20 Best Kept Secret Places to Retire in USA, Acts Retirement-Life Communities, Niche, Movoto, WorldAtlas, and Planswell.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, and median house price. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), and the cost of living index was our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard and not overly expensive, we removed places with a livability score below 60 and a cost of living index higher than 120. A cumulative score was then assigned - livability scores were given a double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Maryland.\n\nFor places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places to retire in Maryland:\n\n15. Sykesville\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 60\n\nLivability: 66\n\nCost of Living Index: 115.7\n\nMedian House Price: $327,704\n\nStarting off our list of the best places to retire in Maryland is none other than the Carroll County town of Sykesville. A small town with a population of less than 4,400 as per the last United States Census, Sykesville is the perfect retirement retreat for senior citizens who want to take a break from the city. While the town carries a higher cost of living, its access to nature - particularly the springs - makes the cost well worth it. Residents can visit Millard Cooper Park, catch up on history at The Gate House Museum, or grab lunch at the locally famed Big Belly Deli sandwich shop.\n\n14. Westminster\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 63\n\nLivability: 67\n\nCost of Living Index: 110.5\n\nMedian House Price: $380,000\n\nOur second pick - the city of Westminster - is also located in Carroll County. A college town, Westminster is home to McDaniel College as well as Carroll Community College, making it a great place for retirees who may want to spend their Golden Years near to family. The city boasts all the basic amenities including a hospital, parks, a public swimming pool, access to fresh produce, and a variety of eateries including favorite spots such as Panera Bread and IHOP.\n\n13. Elkton\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 67\n\nLivability: 65\n\nCost of Living Index: 101.7\n\nMedian House Price: $282,500\n\nFormerly Head of Elk, Elkton is a town in Cecil County. The town is known as the ‘Gretna Green of the East’ and is a popular spot that eloping couples travel to. The town’s reasonable cost of living along with its range of indoor and outdoor activities also make it an ideal retirement spot for older couples or individuals. Some of Elkton’s best features include the Elkton Golf & Batting Center, Detwiler’s Farm Market, and the Elk River Brewing Company brewery.\n\n12. Timonium\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 68\n\nLivability: 75\n\nCost of Living Index: 105.8\n\nMedian House Price: $529,950\n\nIf a happening retirement is on your list, then Timonium in Baltimore County is a place worth exploring. Although a small area, Timonium offers retirees the perfect mix of peaceful living and access to activities to fill their days. It is home to the annual Maryland State Fair which is known for its attractions including horse races, dog shows, and concerts.

        "title": "10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 undervalued cyclical stocks to invest in according to analysts. To skip the detailed analysis of current market conditions and cyclical stocks, go directly to the 5 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts.\n\nThe stocks that follow the patterns of the economy are known as cyclical stocks. Investors usually prefer these stocks during robust economic conditions and ignore them during downturns. However, this is just a general definition and every economic cycle is different. For example, energy is usually considered a cyclical sector, yet it was the best-performing sector in 2022 when inflation reached record highs, averaging 8% in 2022. By the end of the year, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) had gained nearly 58% while the S&P 500 experienced its worst year since 2008, declining by 18.1%.\n\nIn 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the S&P 500 had a tremendous run, gaining nearly 25%, and 11%, respectively. However, we have been recently seeing some signs of correction as it has declined by over 4.6% month-to-date on April 18. The conflicts in the Middle East and higher-for-longer interest rates leading to US treasury bonds reaching their 6-month highs of 4.67 % on April 16, may lead some cautious investors to opt for some low-volatility or counter-cyclical stocks. Nevertheless, the strong earnings season and easing inflation could prove to be beneficial for the more cyclical stocks.\n\nGlobal Growth Forecasts Raised\n\nDespite the recent declines in the market, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that the global economy is still showing resilience. On April 16, it raised its global growth forecasts by 0.3% from October levels. The IMF now predicts global growth to be 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, similar to the levels experienced in 2023. It believes in “stronger activity” from the U.S., China, and other large emerging markets. Nevertheless, weaker activity is predicted in the Euro area. Furthermore, the IMF predicts the median inflation to come down to 2.8% by the end of 2024 and 2.4% in 2025, compared to 4% by the end of 2023.\n\nPerformance of Our Prior Cyclical Recommendations\n\nWe previously provided a list of the best cyclical stocks on November 2, 2023, and our top two stock picks were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Both of these companies have outperformed the broader market between November 2 and April 18 and also on a year-to-date basis. Since November 2, 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up nearly 30% and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is 35% higher, compared to the S&P 500’s 16% gains. On a year-to-date basis, the former is up over 19.5% and the latter has gained nearly 24% on April 18. Furthermore, analysts are still highly bullish on both these stocks and believe in significant upside potential for both.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been covered by 42 Wall Street analysts and all of them rate the stock a Buy. Their average price target of $212.36 shows an 18% upside from its current levels on April 18. On April 18, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock with a $235 price target. The analyst believes that the company's expansion plans look promising with plans to add 45 million square feet of new space this year, focusing on delivery and fulfillment centers, especially in California and Phoenix. This expansion, along with increased delivery stations, strengthens Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) competitive position against USPS, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX). The investment management firm, Polen Capital, also believes in the company and predicted significant margin expansion in its first quarter 2024 investor letter. The firm made the following comments:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is our largest position. Much of our investment thesis is based on solid and durable earnings growth from its three biggest businesses (e-commerce, AWS, and advertising) and disciplined expense management that has supported robust margin expansion and earnings growth. It was only about a year ago that Amazon’s margins bottomed at 1.9%. They are now back to roughly 8%, and we think they can expand significantly.”\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was covered by 26 analysts over the last three months and 23 of them maintain a Buy-equivalent rating on the company and the average analyst price target shows a 14% upside at the time of writing on April 18. On April 11, JPMorgan resumed coverage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) with an Overweight rating and raised its price target to $140 from $120. The firm acknowledged challenges such as declining pay TV subscribers and advertising difficulties faced by the company’s traditional business segments, but suggests that the company can navigate these hurdles through substantial cost restructuring efforts, especially within its linear networks. The Walt Disney Company’s (NYSE:DIS) CEO, Bob Igor, is also very optimistic about the future of the company and made the following comments at its latest earnings call:\n\n“Just one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation, and our strong performance in this past quarter demonstrates that we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios, and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.”\n\nEven though the market saw some pullback in recent days, experts still believe that these minor corrections do not significantly define the broader view of the market and are still bullish. For such conditions, some of the most undervalued cyclical stocks to invest in according to analysts include ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). 10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scoured through the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to find stocks in all the cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary, energy, financials, and materials, and more, with price-earning ratios of under 15 and market capitalization of over $10 billion. Next, we shortlisted our list to 25 stocks with Buy or better ratings and further narrowed down our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price targets on April 18. The analyst ratings were taken from TipRanks and the stocks are listed in ascending order of their average price target upside potential.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around each stock has also been added.

Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts\n\n10.

Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB-as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long- term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply- demand dynamics for the commodity.”\n\n9.

Casino and online gaming company MGM saw double-digit revenue growth and strong 2023 bookings in Las Vegas in the first half, which moderated in the second half but remained solid. A cybersecurity attack negatively impacted 3Q results, but MGM does not expect the $100 million hit to have a material effect on its financial condition and operational results for the year. MGM bought back discounted shares at a 15% annualized rate and authorized another $2 billion buyback in 4Q, which represents another 15% of the company.”\n\n8. Vale S.A.

        "title": "Bull Market Buys: 3 Dow Stocks to Own for the Long Run",
        "content": "Are you looking for new names to own for the long haul? There's a universe of them to choose from. And, that's the problem. There's a universe of stocks to choose from! It would be much easier to narrow your options down to a (much) smaller set of prospects.\n\nWell, consider that task done. If you're looking for a short list of new stocks to consider buying, the 30 tickers that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) are all promising blue chip names. Here are three of the best long-run Dow stocks to dive into at this stage of the young bull market.\n\nVisa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) is of course the world's biggest card-payment network. The 4.3 billion Visa cards collectively held by its worldwide customers can be used at more than 130 million places, allowing the company to process 276 billion transactions last year facilitating $14.8 trillion worth of purchases and cash transfers. This activity in turn produced $32.7 billion worth of revenue for the company itself. And best of all, each of these numbers has been consistently growing for years now. V Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThere's room for plenty more growth ahead though. In fact, there's arguably room for perpetual growth.\n\nIt's clear that cards have largely displaced checks and cash as the preferred means of paying for goods and services. The Federal Reserve reports debit and credit cards now handle on the order of 60% of purchases made within the U.S., with consumers using cards nearly twice as often as they use cash. Oh, people are still using cash... and checks. These two alternatives handle a little more than 20% of consumer purchases in the United States, with sometimes-awkward options like bank transfers making up another 20% of payments. Cash is even more commonly used outside of the U.S. Domestically and abroad though, many of these transactions could be more easily handled by a card company like Visa.\n\nThe thing is, this shift is clearly underway. Analysts expect Visa's top line to improve to the tune of 13% this year and by another 10% next year, easily outpacing overall economic growth. Throw in the ongoing growth of commerce infrastructure in less-developed markets in addition to sheer population growth, and what you've got is a long-term opportunity to extend these near-term growth rates.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting reason to own Visa stock for the long haul, however, is that the company operates several independently operated innovation centers all over the world. These centers are charged with nothing other than building and expanding ecosystems that encourage more frequent usage of its credit and debit cards. This sort of forward-looking effort is actually a pretty big deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't just the biggest e-commerce name in the business -- at least in the Western Hemisphere -- it's also a cloud computing powerhouse. Synergy Research Group reports Amazon Web Services accounted for a market-leading 31% of worldwide spending on cloud computing service in the fourth quarter of 2023. Amazon is even a force to be reckoned with on the streaming front, with numbers from JustWatch indicating Amazon Prime Video's share of the U.S. streaming market eclipsed Netflix's reach during the first quarter of the year.\n\nIt's not what Amazon is, though, that makes it such a hot prospect. It's what it isn't... yet.\n\nAs difficult as it may be to believe, e-commerce is still a relatively small piece of the United States' retail market. The Census Bureau says only about 15% of this country's retail spending is done online, and Amazon itself only accounts for a little less than 40% of the nation's e-commerce industry. Certainly there's some of this spending that will never make its way online, if only because it would be too impractical. A big chunk of the $946 billion worth of consumer spending being done every year in the U.S. could be moved online though, setting the stage for an enormous growth opportunity for Amazon.\n\nAnd that's just within the United States. The company's making e-commerce revenue and profit progress overseas as well.\n\nHere's the thing -- Amazon wouldn't even need to capture the bulk of this other business that's up for grabs to continue its phenomenal success. Just driving a few more new shoppers to the site in the years ahead could prove a boon.\n\nWhile Amazon.com started out as a simply online shopping platform, it's since evolved. It's now an advertising platform as well, collecting $46.8 billion worth of high-margin ad revenue last year from third-party sellers looking to prominently feature their products on the site. That's a 24% improvement on 2022's advertising business, yet this growth still only scratches the surface of the opportunity. eMarketer says the nation's entire retail media ad business should more than double between now and 2027, when it will be worth nearly $110 billion. Amazon already controls the vast majority of this market, and will likely still be in the distant lead at the end of that time frame.\n\nThe bigger point is, the e-commerce giant has plenty of growth levers to pull in the near and distant future.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nLast but not least, add JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) to your list of Dow stocks to own for the long run.\n\nAnyone keeping tabs on this stock probably knows shares tumbled following (and even a little before) the release of its first-quarter numbers just a few days back. Although sales and earnings both topped estimates, the megabank's decision to not raise its net interest income guidance for 2024 rattled shareholders. Credit card charge-offs were up while total deposits were down as well, further jarring investors. End result? JPMorgan shares are now down 10% from March's high.\n\nThis sell-off, however, ignores a couple of key details about JPMorgan Chase's foreseeable future.\n\nThe first of these details is that the company is seeing strong signs on several important fronts. Take its capital markets business as an example. Although transaction revenue is still a bit suppressed, investment banking fees were up 21% year over year during the first quarter, in step with the industrywide rebound in fundraising and dealmaking; both Bank of America and Morgan Stanley also saw a pronounced uptick in corporate fundraising that could portend a prolonged period of strong dealmaking demand. Ditto for Goldman Sachs, prompting Goldman's CEO David Solomon to interpret his company's Q1 IPO activity as a sign that \"we're in the early stages of a reopening\" of this market.\n\nAnd what other detail is seemingly being missed here? It's just possible that JPMorgan Chase is being far more conservative with its interest income outlook than it needs to be.\n\nPersistent inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to postpone and dial back its plans to lower interest rates this year, but a reasonably healthy economy is forcing consumers and corporations alike to forge ahead with their borrowing and spending plans anyway.

        "title": "My Top 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks has been a powerhouse in the market since the start of 2023, with all of them beating the S&P 500. It includes:\n\nMicrosoft  Apple Nvidia Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla\n\nThis collection has had a strong run, but not every one of them is a strong buy right now, in my opinion. Nearly every one of these companies has artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations, but my reason for buying three of the seven stocks is centered around a much older practice: Advertising.\n\nAdvertising is a massive industry\n\nIf advertising is my reason to buy some of these stocks, then Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are the ones I'm talking about. This trio generates a massive amount of revenue each quarter from advertising.\n\nCompany Q4 Advertising Revenue Alphabet  $65.5 Billion Meta Platforms  $38.7 Billion Amazon $14.7 Billion\n\nData sources: Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta are leaders in this category, some may be surprised that Amazon is also heavily involved in the ad marketplace. In fact, advertising services were Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter, increasing 27% year over year.\n\nMeta's ad division also put up solid growth figures in Q4, with its ad revenue rising 24% year over year. Alphabet was the laggard of the trio, but this also makes sense due to its sheer size. It delivered an 11% growth rate in Q4.\n\nSo why are these growth rates a big deal? Well, if you rewind the clock to this time last year, these rates weren't nearly as impressive (besides Amazon). The ad market struggled in early 2023 due to fears of a recession. When businesses are concerned about a potential economic downfall, they save on whatever expenses they can. One of the easiest places to trim is ad budgets, which negatively affects businesses like Meta and Alphabet, which are highly concentrated in this industry.\n\nHowever, the fear of imminent recession has subsided, so businesses are happy to begin increasing their ad budgets. This is why ad-heavy companies like Meta and Alphabet have seen success recently.\n\nAmazon is a different story, as their ad revenue growth never dipped like Alphabet's or Meta's. This is likely due to the relatively young age of Amazon's ad business and that it's still working on building out its capabilities. When this segment matures, it will likely display the cyclical trends that the other two do, but it's in full growth mode right now.\n\nWith the ad market improving each quarter, all three companies stand to benefit, making them excellent buys.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks are still attractive buys\n\nIn addition to a recovering ad market, these three are some of the most attractively priced Magnificent Seven stocks. My valuation metric of choice for Alphabet and Meta is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the trailing 12 months used in the more common trailing P/E ratio still includes some quarters where the ad business was down. If you use this metric, it's clear these two are fairly priced. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWe can use Amazon's forward P/E (it's at 44), but that isn't fair to the business as portions of the company (like its international commerce division) aren't profitable and aren't expected to become fully profitable for some time. As a result, I'll use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to value Amazon. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nFrom this perspective, Amazon still has a way to go before being valued at the same levels as 2018 through 2021. So, investors can confidently buy the stock, knowing that it still isn't back to historical valuation norms.\n\nAdvertising is a great business to be in right now, which makes this trio a fantastic pick in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks You Can Buy With This Year's Average $3,011 Tax Refund",
        "content": "Another tax day has come and gone, and refunds are always a focus of this tax season. Through early April, the average amount refunded to taxpayers was $3,011.\n\nThis involves both bad news and good news for investors. The bad news is that those taxpayers made an interest-free loan to the government. However, the sting of that realization may be helped by the good news that taxpayers finally have their money back, likely giving them some cash to invest.\n\nThose who want to find Warren Buffett investments (or at least stocks from his team at Berkshire Hathaway) might consider some of the consumer stocks he holds right now. Let's look at two below.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett recognized late. He and his team waited until the first quarter of 2019 to invest in the e-commerce giant even though it has been trading since 1997. The optionality of its many businesses and the stock's tremendous growth has been a boon to Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nAmazon began as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest revenue source. But it also supports fast-growing businesses such as subscriptions (Amazon Prime), online seller services, and online advertising. Investors should pay particular attention to its cloud computing operation. That segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), drives the majority of the company's operating income.\n\nToday, the company has a massive $1.9 trillion market value. In 2023, Amazon claimed a staggering $575 billion in net sales, a 12% yearly increase. Since operating expenses grew at a slower 7% rate over that time, profits rose significantly. Amazon was able to earn $30 billion in net income in 2023, a huge improvement over its $3 billion loss in the prior year.\n\nAmazon's shares are trading at $184 per share, so investors receiving the average tax refund can afford a few shares despite an 80% increase in the stock price.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Amazon's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 63 may sound rich, but it's notably lower than the five-year average of 91. Additionally, its forward P/E ratio of 44 speaks to the 45% earnings growth expected for the retail giant, a pace that could keep it a market-beating holding for shareholders.\n\nFloor & Decor\n\nRegional to national growth stories propelled stocks like Home Depot in the previous century, and that trend appears set to bolster a smaller Home Depot competitor called Floor & Decor Holdings(NYSE: FND). Buffett's team began buying the company in the third quarter of 2021. It specializes in hard flooring and decor, offering more selection than a Home Depot and using its bulk purchasing power to offer low prices to consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Floor & Decor had expanded to 36 states, and its store count of 221 grew by 31 during that fiscal year. Also, it plans to open between 30 and 35 new stores in fiscal 2024, bringing it closer to a long-term goal of operating 500 locations.\n\nAdmittedly, the sluggish economy affected its near-term performance. During fiscal 2023, net sales of $4.4 billion rose 4%, well below the double-digit increases of past years. Moreover, rising selling and store operating expenses took a toll, and net income of $246 million dropped 18% from the previous fiscal year.\n\nThat placed upward pressure on the P/E ratio, which currently stands at 49. While this is above the five-year average of 40, it's not at unusual levels for the stock. Also, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 2.7, a bit below its 2.9 average, indicating that it's not as overpriced as the P/E ratio might imply.\n\nIndeed, the stock continues moving higher despite the company's struggles. A price of about $110 per share makes it affordable for most income-tax-refund recipients.\n\nAdditionally, hard flooring has the type of \"forever\" demand that attracts Buffett and can boost the stock over time. As the company brings additional offerings to the hard-flooring industry, the stock should continue to move higher as it expands into additional markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "“The biggest reality competition series ever,” Beast Games is the product of YouTuber MrBeast and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) MGM Studios coming together. Based on Jimmy Donaldson’s, aka MrBeast, already popular YouTube program, the series will have 1,000 competitors vying for a chance to win a $5 million cash prize. The recent action by MrBeast is creating a lot of interest in streaming stocks.\n\nOne of Donaldson’s YouTube videos typically costs between $4 and $5 million. Beast Games is expected to have a much larger budget. On the other hand, the deal with Amazon is reportedly worth $100 million.\n\nThe focus is undoubtedly on streaming stocks now that MrBeast and Amazon have made their moves, given these stocks are already doing strongly because of Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) return to profitable growth. However, taking analyst projections into account, we will investigate three equities that are cheap. If investors want to take advantage of the most recent news from Mr. Beast, they will provide some excellent upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the industry’s heavy hitters, such as Netflix, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) continues to struggle this year, with shares losing 36% in value, making it a contrarian play. The firm prioritizes user engagement and income via partnerships and advertising on its vast user base; considering the lack of price momentum it’s one of the more attractively valued streaming stocks to play the MrBeast news.\n\nThe plan has worked thus far. Four quarterly earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations, with the latest EPS up 55%. Roku will reveal its Q1 2024 financial results after the market closes on April 25, 2024.\n\nBesides financial performance, newer Roku Pro Series TVs stream better, with sub-$1,500 TVs providing high-end streaming. AI-powered recommendations and UI enhancements are in Roku OS 12. Moreover, live sports and enhanced design are on a new mobile app.\n\nOver and above that, Roku and the NBA introduced NBA FAST, which features historical games, highlights and current NBA G League games. Media Play News uses Roku’s live sports streaming.\n\nMore recent Roku firmware upgrades increase content accessibility and Amazon Prime Video, Discovery+ and Vix Plus compatibility.\n\nRoku’s deliberate improvements to user experience and content availability, especially in competitive live TV and sports streaming sectors, show that it’s ready to change the narrative and justify its “Moderate Buy,” with 20 ratings and 47% upside. Roku will capture attention among streaming stocks with its fresh product improvements as MrBeast plans his multimillion-dollar Amazon spectacle.\n\nStory continues\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGiven the excitement around MrBeast and his collaboration with Amazon, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which enhances its services via partnerships and technology, is among the finest streaming stocks to purchase.\n\nWith the Seaport Stays Hotel, the firm provides Ethernet Dedicated Internet, Business Internet and X1 for Hospitality. The company is also growing its streaming technologies there. With this integration, Comcast hopes to provide dependable and expandable networking solutions to the hotel sector.\n\nFurthermore, Xfinity Mobile by Comcast provides more premium data plans and features — like streaming and limitless internet — than its rivals. For heavy data streamers, the new plans provide more value and flexibility.\n\nTo further provide tailored advertising, Comcast employs AI to assess the emotional tones of TV programming. This technology makes television more enjoyable by automatically matching advertisements with topics such as family values.\n\nAdditionally, layoffs of 4% affect engineering and installation personnel the most as Comcast’s Sky subsidiary moves from satellite to internet streaming. But to continue prospering in a challenging climate, operations must be streamlined. More positively, new people are using non-traditionally installed streaming services like Sky Glass and Sky Stream.\n\nWith a potential upside of 28%, analysts rate CMCSA as a “Moderate Buy.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter purchasing Discovery+ and HBO Max, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is one of the market leaders, thanks to an extensive content library housing hits like “House of the Dragon” and partnerships for content development.\n\nIn its strategy, WB Discovery is mainly looking to address digitization and streaming competition. In 2025, the business will limit password sharing to protect lost money on shared accounts.\n\nThe entertainment behemoth lost $400 million on $10.28 billion in sales in Q4’23. Therefore, password sharing must be forbidden for WBD stock to recover from its 28% 2024 loss.\n\nBetter news: Q4 debt repayments totaled $1.2 billion, leaving $4.3 billion cash. Despite losses, Warner Bros. Discovery maintained strong cash flow. Through acquisitions and increased ARPU, the direct-to-consumer segment gained 97.7 million customers globally.\n\nBesides the financial news, Tom Cruise has made his way back to Warner Bros. Discovery with the signing of a strategic agreement to develop and produce both original and franchise theatrical pictures.\n\nThe firm is also growing its content by acquiring Premier League and NASCAR broadcasting rights, which will improve its sports broadcasting segment.\n\nFinally, given the present economy, WBD is reorganizing to save expenses and simplify operations. This method helped WB Discovery reduce its Q4 deficit despite a 14% drop in advertising revenue due to expenditure reduction.\n\nAnalyst estimates indicate WBD stock holds an upside potential of 64% based on a price target of $13.61.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time. He has outperformed the stock market for many years. The Oracle of Omaha’s long-term success has prompted many people to study his teachings and look closer at his portfolio.\n\nWhile he has exceeded market returns, not all of Buffett’s stocks have been winners. Some of the stocks in his portfolio aren’t promising, but it’s the good stocks he picks that do most of the heavy lifting. Adding solid companies to your portfolio can increase your odds of outperforming the market. These are three Warren Buffett stocks to buy now.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett has many finance stocks in his portfolio, including Visa (NYSE:V). The credit and debit card leader offers impressive financial growth and profit margins. Many consumers use credit and debit cards to buy goods and services due to convenience, rewards and the opportunity to build credit with a credit card.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa reported 9% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Net income grew by 17% YoY and helped the firm secure a 56.64% net profit margin.\n\nWarren Buffett isn’t the only investor who feels good about Visa stock. Analysts have rated the stock as a Strong Buy and believe there is a 14% upside from its current price. The highest price target of $335 per share offers additional optimism.\n\nVisa stock has been achieving returns similar to the stock market. Shares are up by 5% year-to-date and have gained 70% over the past five years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nWarren Buffett has been late to the party for tech stocks, but he does have Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in his portfolio. The company checks many of his boxes. It has a competitive moat and rising profit margins. AMZN also has a runway to expand in e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, streaming and other segments for several years.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the market with an 18% year-to-date gain. Shares are up by 76% over the past year. Analysts believe the stock can go higher and are projecting an 18% upside. The stock has a Strong Buy rating from 42 analysts, all of whom rated the stock as a Buy. It’s rare for analysts to universally approve of a stock.\n\nAmazon reported another successful quarter, which featured 14% YoY revenue growth. The tech conglomerate generated a record $170.0 billion in revenue during that quarter. Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud platform, increased its sales by 13% YoY.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is another finance stock that has found its way into Buffett’s portfolio. He’s been investing in this one for decades, and it’s easy to see why. The stock is up by 93% over the past five years and only has a 20 P/E ratio. That’s a lower valuation than most credit and debit card stocks.\n\nThe financial firm is expecting to deliver revenue growth ranging from 9% to 11% each year beyond 2026. The company also expects its EPS growth rate to be in the mid-teens. American Express lived up to those standards in Q4 2023. Revenue and net income increased by 11% and 23% YoY, respectively.\n\nAmerican Express has also done a good job with its dividend. The company announced in its Q4 2023 press release that it would hike its dividend by 17%. That’s an upgrade from the company’s annualized 10.43% dividend growth rate over the past decade.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff admits he'd ‘be a lot richer’ if he'd just invested in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "These 3 Top E-Commerce Stocks Are No-Brainer Buys, but Not for the Reasons You Think",
        "content": "E-commerce has grown into a massive industry. Despite beginning in the late 20th century, it continues to grow at a relatively rapid pace. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% through 2030, taking the industry's global size to $5.4 trillion if the prediction holds.\n\nDespite the increase, many of the largest e-commerce companies have morphed into conglomerates, encompassing many businesses. Thus, despite their e-commerce potential, these three companies will likely drive most of their growth from segments outside of that business.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost consumers and investors likely see Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as an e-commerce company. That makes sense on some levels since online sales are the single largest source of revenue for the conglomerate.\n\nBut Amazon's financials imply that online sales could be a loss leader. Instead, the company derives revenue from other sources such as selling ads on the site, subscription services (namely Amazon Prime), and providing online seller services.\n\nMoreover, investors should not ignore its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It accounted for only about 16% of net sales in 2023, but due to significantly higher margins, it contributed the majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nOverall, net sales in 2023 totaled $575 billion, 12% higher than one year ago. Thanks to slower growth in operating costs, Amazon returned to profitability, earning $30 billion in net income in 2023. It lost $3 billion in 2022.\n\nAmid that recovery, the stock has risen by around 80% over the last year, and its 63 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is close to historical lows for the stock. As its smaller businesses propel relatively rapid profit growth, the stock should continue to drive significant returns for investors.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nLatin American e-commerce leader MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) has had to innovate from the beginning to succeed. When it began in 1999, selling online presented a challenge to cash-based customers.\n\nTo that end, the company formed Mercado Pago to offer financial services that facilitated purchases. So successful was this segment that it offered services to businesses and customers outside of MercadoLibre.\n\nThe company extended that innovation to order fulfillment and delivery through Mercado Envios. This allowed it to package and ship goods to clients, bringing one-day and two-day delivery to areas that had not had that previously. Also, like Amazon, MercadoLibre derives revenue from selling advertising on its site.\n\nThanks to these separate businesses and the synergies created when they work together, MercadoLibre generated more than $14 billion in revenue in 2023, a 38% increase from year-ago levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver that period, it also earned $987 million in net income, more than double the $482 million reported in 2022.\n\nAmid recent struggles involving a one-time tax liability, growth in lower-margin first-party sales, and falling shipping revenue, the stock grew by only 8% over the last year.\n\nNonetheless, the P/E ratio of around 72 is near historical lows and compares well to its U.S. counterpart, Amazon. As MercadoLibre moves on from the tax liability and continues to capitalize on synergies in its home region, the stock is likely to continue moving higher.\n\n3. Sea Limited\n\nSea Limited(NYSE: SE) was a highflier during the 2021 bull market, but like many tech stocks during that time, missteps and misfortune took a toll on the company during the subsequent bear market.\n\nIts Shopee e-commerce segment dealt with failed market entries into Europe and Latin America. Also, with the gaming segment Garena, a ban on Free Fire in India led investors to sour on the stock. Consequently, shares are down by around 85% from their 2021 high. SE Chart\n\nThe last earnings call offered some hope to investors. The company has emphasized building a logistics infrastructure in its home markets in Southeast Asia, which should bolster its competitive advantage in those markets, helping it maintain its market lead.\n\nMoreover, Garena developed a version of Free Fire that addresses the security concerns of the previous version. That increases the likelihood that it will return to India, a market with 1.4 billion people.\n\nGarena's recovery could be crucial to boosting revenue under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which grew 5% in 2023 to $13 billion. If Garena could come closer to matching Shopee's 24% revenue growth and the 44% increase for its fintech arm, SeaMoney, such increases could revive interest in the stock.\n\nDespite Garena's struggles, net income was $163 million, its first annual profit as a public company. Also, even with yearly declines, Sea Limited stock has risen by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nAs it recovers, the forward P/E ratio of 34 could draw investors amid rapid profit increases, eventually helping it return to all-time highs from 2021 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Tesla: Here Are 2 Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- has continued to outperform the broader market, up 15% year to date as a group, compared to a 6% return from the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHowever, not all stocks in this group have lived up to its label recently. Shares of Nvidia and Amazon have been two of the best performers, up 76% and 20% year to date, respectively. Meanwhile, Tesla stock has fallen 37% this year, as it is struggling to grow sales of electric vehicles (EVs) amid rising interest rates.\n\nAccelerating growth in a company's revenue and profits usually leads to superior shareholder returns, and Nvidia and Amazon still have near-term catalysts that could support higher share prices. Here's why these two Magnificent Seven stocks are still solid choices.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nCompanies are investing heavily to build and train computing models with artificial intelligence (AI). This is pushing the world's largest data center operators to plan significant increases in capacity over the next few years. This spells a tremendous growth opportunity for Nvidia, a leading data center supplier.\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is in short supply and sells for the price of a Tesla Model 3. But unlike with Tesla, demand for Nvidia's product is exploding. Nvidia's revenue jumped 126% last year, and management expects its next-generation chips to remain supply-constrained due to high demand.\n\nAlmost every industry is using AI in some form. That's why about $1 trillion of data-center infrastructure is transitioning to GPU-centric computing systems to handle the rigorous demands of AI processing.\n\nCompanies rely on Nvidia because of its multidecade GPU innovation. The company recently unveiled its next-generation Blackwell B200 chip. This new AI chip will reportedly cost between $30,000 to $40,000, and Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla are expected to be early adopters.\n\nThe Wall Street consensus expects Nvidia to grow earnings by 89% this year. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 seems on the low side for that level of growth, but it seems investors are already anticipating that Nvidia won't be able to sustain this high level of growth for long, as companies with $60 billion of annual revenue usually can't.\n\nHowever given the large amount of data center infrastructure that is in the early stages of switching over to more advanced hardware, Nvidia should grow revenue and profits at double-digit rates for several more years. That should lead to market-beating returns from current share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported accelerating growth from its online stores in the fourth quarter as the e-commerce market recovers. It appears the impact of high inflation on consumer spending a few years ago is starting to fade. Even Amazon's cloud services business, which generates most of the company's operating profit, experienced an uptick in growth toward the end of the year. The company entered 2024 with growing momentum across the business.\n\nThe key catalyst that could send the stock higher from here is the company's improving profitability. The e-commerce leader spent years investing billions to expand its transportation capabilities and same-day delivery across major cities. Management is now focused on reaping the rewards of these investments. Operating profit soared in Q4, up 383% year over year, and there's more to come.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy noted in the recent annual shareholder letter that Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per-unit basis for the first time since 2018, and it still has more work to do. Roth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni estimates Amazon still has over 20% efficiencies to gain in the supply chain. This should translate to even higher profits. The current Wall Street consensus has Amazon's earnings per share more than doubling over the next two years.\n\nDespite the stock's gains so far this year, it still trades at a price-to-sales ratio that is in line with its previous 10-year average -- a period when margins from online sales were lower due to the company's heavy focus on expanding its e-commerce capabilities. If Amazon continues to increase its profit margin over the next decade, it might earn an even higher valuation and fuel market-beating returns for investors.\n\nThe stock could pull back if there's another market dip, but looking ahead a few years, I believe Amazon offers attractive upside potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Online giant Wayfair is opening its first brick-and-mortar furniture store",
        "content": "Amazon’s not the only big online retailer that’s exploring the brick-and-mortar space.\n\nHome furnishings retailer Wayfair has announced plans to open a 15,000-square-foot physical location in Wilmette, Ill. The store will carry a variety of home goods, including furniture. home decor, housewares and home improvement products.\n\nAnd, like many giant home goods stores, it will also have its own restaurant—called The Porch. The permanent location, which will open on May 23, follows test stores in other locations.\n\nWayfair’s expansion comes at a tenuous time for the company. Its 2023 sales fell 1.8% and it posted a net loss for the year. The company also laid off 13% of its workforce in January, totaling some 1,650 workers. That followed 1,750 job cuts in 2023.\n\nWayfair has struggled against larger online retailers, something CEO Niraj Shah wrote in a January memo to staff.\n\n“We went overboard in hiring during a strong economic period and veered away from our core principles, and while we have come quite far back to them, we are not quite there,” Shah wrote, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nShah also was criticized last year for telling employees to work harder and blend their personal life with their professional one. The idea, he wrote, that staff should not work late was “laughably false”.\n\nThe hope is the brick and mortar store will spur consumers to buy more, as discretionary spending on big-ticket items online, such as the furniture that is Wayfair’s bread and butter, has plunged since the end of the pandemic.\n\nPhysical locations are a gamble, though, and don’t always pay off. Amazon last month announced it was closing all of its “Amazon 4-Star” locations and pop-up kiosks, which had begun rolling out in 2015. Whole Food Market stores, of course, are not affected by the pullback.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

This means that TRIP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nTRIP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.16, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 43.74. We also note that TRIP has a PEG ratio of 0.90. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for TRIP is its P/B ratio of 3.99. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 9.22.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, TRIP holds a Value grade of B, while AMZN has a Value grade of C.\n\nTRIP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that TRIP is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "12 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in. To know more about the top stocks, go directly to 5 Best Diversified Stocks To Invest In.\n\nForbes asked a group of experts about the changing global landscape and its effect on investors. These experts included Justin Onuekwusi (JO), Kasim Zafar (KZ), and EQ Investors. They discussed the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on investors in 2024 and shed light on the significance of geographic diversification. The US presidential elections can also introduce uncertainty into the markets, especially if the outcome is uncertain or if there's a perception that it could significantly alter economic policies. Diversification remains a key strategy for investors to mitigate the risks associated with such geopolitical uncertainties. By spreading investments across different geographic regions, asset classes, and industries, investors can potentially reduce the impact of any single event or market downturn on their overall portfolio.\n\nInvestment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has gained momentum, especially because of diversification. It has opened many opportunities for numerous investors that enable them to make informed decisions based on current market conditions. ETFs hold a collection of securities that offer investors benefit of immediate diversification by spreading investment across multiple assets. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is one of the popular ETF that aims to replicate the performance of the entire S&P 500 index with low annual fees of only 30 cents against a $1000 investment. Moving forward, substantial potential for growth and innovation in ETF space is expected due to its ability to allow investors to tailor investments to their financial goals and risk levels. ETFs are traded on a stock exchange, unlike its chief rival mutual funds among retail investors. According to Morningstar, investors withdrew over $900 billion from mutual funds in 2022 and funneled about $600 billion into ETFs and PwC anticipates total global ETF assets could exceed $20 trillion by 2026. If you are a beginner investor, investing in ETFs is a good idea because you will generate the average performance of the market in your portfolio. If you'd like to generate higher than average returns, you need to identify stocks with large upside potential. Sites like Insider Monkey is a good starting point to identify such stocks. For example, hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here) and Insider Monkey shares the list of these stocks periodically.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an era where investors are predisposed to geopolitical unrest because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing power rivalry between US and China, it is imperative to adopt more diversified and flexible investment strategies. Diversification is a viable option for investors to help insulate portfolios, especially during times of economic recession and geopolitical unrest.\n\nWarren Buffett, in his recent annual letter, mentioned that his sprawling conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway possesses the largest net worth among all American businesses, amounting to around 6% of the combined net worth of all S&P 500 companies. The conglomerate’s stock has surged approximately 16% in 2024, more than double the S&P 500’s return, following a similar 16% increase in 2023 and the market value has gone up to $900 billion. Warren Buffett’s investment philosophy is against the common practice of over diversification. He has emphasized enough on the importance of quality over quantity in investment choices and suggested a deep conviction and understanding of a few chosen companies for significant health creation.\n\nLooking forward to 2025, investors, in view of diversification, may allocate funds to assets such as bonds, Public Provident Fund, gold, real estate and bank deposits that are more secure investment alternatives. The 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds needs to be modernized as the unprecedented spike in inflation and interest rates in 2022 clobbered stocks and bonds. Therefore, investors might contemplate reallocating 10% portion from 60% of which is allocated for stocks to secure asset classes offering higher yields such as banks are offering 5% to 5.5% on high yield accounts.\n\nAnalysts have predicted continued acceleration in S&P 500 earnings, forecasting 3.9% year-over-year growth in Q1, followed by a further increase of 9% in Q2 of 2024. And a substantial growth of 20.8% in earnings has been witnessed in the technology sector, driven by the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a remarkable increase of 265% in revenue for Q4.\n\nSome of the best diversified stocks to invest in based on hedge funds’ assessments are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). For this, we decided to take a look the 12 best diversified stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the best diversified stocks to invest in, we filtered companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq having multiple product lines and several revenue streams. The stocks were then ranked according to their hedge fund sentiment data which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 best hedge funds at the end of Q4 last year. The ranking was based on the ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each stock and then the top 12 best diversified stocks were selected for investment purposes.\n\nBest Diversified Stocks To Invest In\n\n12.

        "title": "11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nAmid rising inflation and economic uncertainty, millions of young Americans are starting to invest in different asset classes to secure their future and achieve their financial goals. As of the end of 2022, a whopping 58% of US households reported owning stocks, according to the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances. Increasing household wealth and the rise of zero-commission apps like Robinhood is partially responsible for this boom in retail investing.\n\nHas there been any change in retail investing trends ever since the Fed started raising interest rates? Money-market funds, bonds, treasuries and fixed income in general became much more tempting for investors who wanted to avoid volatility that comes with stock investing. In August last year, The Wall Street Journal, citing data from Refinitiv Lipper, said in a report that in matter of just five weeks, investors pulled $11.6 billion from stock funds on a net basis, while money-market funds saw an inflow of $91.1 billion.\n\nYoung Americans are Investing in Stocks and Pre-IPO Growth Companies\n\nAnalysts also note that young Americans are increasingly getting bored of the same-old names when it comes to stocks and want to invest in companies that will grow big in the future. They want to invest in the Apples, Microsofts and Nvidias of the future. And there are interesting options available for such investors. The Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) fund, which recently went public, lets you invest in high-growth companies that aren’t publicly traded. Some top names in the fund's portfolio are OpenAI, SpaceX, commercial space station company Axiom Space, Discord, Klarna, among many others. Other platforms allowing investors to invest in high-growth companies are also seeing a huge influx of young investors. For example, an April 16 Bloomberg report talked about Hiive, a platform that allows you to invest in pre-IPO, VC-backed companies. The report quoted Hiive's CEO Sim Desai, who said that the number of daily accepted bids has averaged 16 in the past 30 days, up from just three bids a year ago.\n\nRobinhood's Popularity is Increasing\n\nRobinhood is one of the popular platforms for retail investors, with over 10 million monthly active users. It's no longer an investing app where young investors band together to wage wars against short-selling hedge funds. Instead the company is in an expansion mode with new products for crypto investors as well as credit and gold cards. Last month, Bernstein started covering Robinhood stock with an Outperform rating, saying a \"monster\" crypto cycle over the next two years could boost the stock as more and more retail investors turn to the app to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024\n\nPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash\n\nTeenagers Using Apps to Invest\n\nBeyond millennial Redditors, there's another class of retail investors entering the market: teenagers. Investing-related TikTok videos, personal finance blogs, Instagram influencers and an overall rise in financial awareness is causing teenagers in America to invest. In 2022, there were about 200,000 custodial accounts for teens at Schwab, compared to just 120,000 in 2019. That figure jumped to 300,000 in 2023.\n\nDon’t Miss: Best Long-Term Investments for Your Child\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used publicly available data from Robinhood that shows the most popular stocks on the investing app. We also did some manual research to see which stocks are trending on the app these days with positive sentiment. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with these stocks where available. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).  Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11.

DJT is rebounding after these dips and the stock is up a whopping 23% over the past five days.\n\n10. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) remains one of the favorites of retail investors who scored huge wins against hedge funds shorting the stock back in the pandemic days. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares have lost about 39% so far this year. Short sellers are targeting the stock again, with GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) short interest coming in at 24% as of April 16. Are retail investors banding together yet again to beat these short sellers? Only time will tell. But for now, the stock is declining after disappointing Q4 results which saw GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) hardware sales tanking.\n\n9.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”\n\n7. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024. The stock has gained about 24% so far this year.

Like DIS, hedge funds and retail investors also like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),   Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is also one of the most popular stocks among the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Our data shows that 89 hedge funds had stakes in Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) as of the end of 2023.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”\n\n6. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are struggling this year as the company continues to face growth challenges amid competition. In a latest blow, data shows that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lost its market leader status in the smartphone industry to Samsung. Data from IDC shows that iPhone shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter of 2024. Samsung’s market share jumped to 20.8% as of the end of the first quarter, while Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to 17.3%. IDC said rising competition in China from companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, among others, is part of the reason why Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Dividend Stocks with Over 9% Yield According to Analysts 10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How to Find Strong Retail-Wholesale Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Wingstop (WING) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.78 a share 12 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 1, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.78 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.73 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Wingstop has an Earnings ESP of 6.2%.\n\nWING is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAmazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 30, 2024. AMZN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.91 a share 11 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon is $0.82, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 11.66%.\n\nWING and AMZN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be Worth More Than Microsoft 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is now the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of just over $3 trillion. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has played a central role in helping the tech giant reach this position.\n\nShares of Microsoft have jumped more than 72% since the beginning of 2023 when the AI revolution started taking hold. The stock's performance has matched that of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index during this period. Microsoft's impressive rally seems well-deserved considering that the company has been quick to monetize its partnership with OpenAI and is offering a wide range of AI-focused solutions across its software portfolio.\n\nAI has started moving the needle for Microsoft already, with the company witnessing growth in lucrative markets such as cloud computing. Looking ahead, Microsoft could remain a solid AI play thanks to adoption of the technology in the workplace collaboration, cloud, gaming, and personal computer (PC) markets.\n\nHowever, Microsoft itself expects AI to only make a gradual contribution to its growth. Meanwhile, analysts at investment banking firm Evercore predict that AI could add $100 billion to Microsoft's annual revenue by 2027. The company's trailing-12-month revenue of $575 billion suggests that AI could give Microsoft's top line a 17% boost over the next three years based on Evercore's estimate.\n\nThis probably explains why analysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings to increase at 16% a year for the next five years. While that's a decent pace of growth, there are other AI stocks that are anticipated to clock much faster growth over the next five years, and they may even become more valuable than Microsoft.\n\nWe are going to take a look at one such name in this article.\n\nAmazon could be a big winner of the AI revolution\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the sixth-largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. Like Microsoft, the e-commerce and cloud computing giant has been aggressively incorporating AI elements into its various offerings.\n\nFor instance, the company is bolstering its cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- by offering customers \"the most expansive collection of compute instances.\" AWS customers can not only get access to chips from chip giant Nvidia to train and deploy AI models on its cloud computing platform, but they can also access Amazon's in-house chips for their AI needs if they are looking for performance on a budget.\n\nAmazon management pointed out on the company's February earnings conference call that \"several customers [use] our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Rico, and Snap.\" That's not surprising, as different companies have different needs when it comes to developing AI applications, and not everyone needs the power of an expensive Nvidia graphics card.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has recognized this, and is looking to capitalize on its position as the leading cloud computing provider to win more AI-related business. AWS controlled 31% of the cloud infrastructure market at the end of last year. The integration of AI tools into its platform is a smart move by Amazon, as the demand for AI services in the cloud could grow at an annual rate of 36% through 2032, generating $887 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe good news for Amazon investors is that the cloud isn't the only area where the company is deploying AI to power its long-term growth. It has introduced e-commerce-focused AI tools as well. Amazon has harnessed the power of generative AI to help sellers create product pages on its e-commerce platform with just a link to their websites. Sellers won't have to go through a lengthy and tedious process to populate product pages manually.\n\nThat's why it isn't surprising to see that more than 100,000 of the company's selling partners have already used this tool, which simplifies the process of creating listings on the platform. The ease of creating product pages could help Amazon attract more sellers and allow it to corner a bigger share of the e-commerce market in the future.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon has rolled out a generative AI-powered assistant known as Rufus to help improve product discovery for customers shopping on its platform. Amazon has trained Rufus using its \"extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web.\" As a result, the company could encourage more customer spending on its platform by using AI to recommend the right products.\n\nAll in all, it is easy to see why analysts are expecting Amazon to clock a healthy annual earnings growth rate of 30% for the next five years. But will this be enough to make it bigger than Microsoft five years from now?\n\nCan Amazon overtake Microsoft?\n\nAmazon finished 2023 with earnings of $2.90 per share. If its earnings indeed grow at 30% a year for the next five years, Amazon's bottom line could jump to $10.77 per share. The stock is currently trading at 44 times forward earnings. That's in line with the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple. Given that Amazon's earnings growth is forecast to accelerate over the next five years compared to the 10% growth it has clocked in the last five, the market could reward it with a richer multiple.\n\nBut even if Amazon maintains its forward earnings multiple in five years, its stock price could jump to $474. That would be a 158% jump from current levels, indicating that Amazon's market cap could increase to $4.9 trillion after five years.\n\nMicrosoft's projected earnings growth rate of 16% could take its bottom line to $20.60 in five years (using its fiscal 2023 earnings of $9.81 per share as the base). Microsoft is currently trading at 31 times forward earnings, which is a slight premium to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.\n\nConsidering that Microsoft is predicted to clock slower earnings growth than Amazon, we are going to assume that it will trade at a discount to Amazon and maintain a P/E multiple of 29 in five years based on its five-year average. So Microsoft stock could jump to $597 after five years. That would be a 43% jump from current levels, indicating that its market capitalization could rise to $4.4 trillion after five years.\n\nAs such, the possibility of Amazon becoming a bigger company than Microsoft in five years cannot be ruled out, which is why investors looking to buy an AI stock that can deliver healthy long-term gains should keep it on their radars.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term.",
        "content": "The tech industry has dominated stock-market gains for quite some time now, and it's been even more noticeable with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of the high-growth opportunities many tech companies provide, it makes sense why many growth-seeking investors go the tech route.\n\nRegardless of the opportunities that tech stocks offer, it's still important that investors keep a long-term mindset and not approach them expecting to get rich quickly.\n\nFor investors with $5,000 available to invest, the following three options are good long-term choices, and you can divide your money evenly among them. They each operate in different tech industries but are market leaders in their own right.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nFrom an online bookstore to a tech conglomerate, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is arguably the prime example of growth stocks in the tech industry. A $1,000 investment in Amazon at its May 1997 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth over $1.8 million today.\n\nAmazon rose to dominance because of its e-commerce business but has since become the leading cloud service provider with its platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's also made a mark in the entertainment industry with its Prime Video.\n\nE-commerce accounts for most of Amazon's revenue, but AWS is responsible for much of the company's profits. Both factors explain why the company is poised to be a force for the long haul. Regarding e-commerce, it's beginning to leverage its logistics network, which cost the company billions to develop, to generate new income streams with its Supply Chain by Amazon.\n\nSupply Chain by Amazon is a fully automated set of supply chain services that allow sellers to use the company's intricate logistics, warehousing, distribution, fulfillment capabilities, and transportation (including international). Being able to grow from its own e-commerce business to serve the broader e-commerce market will only strengthen Amazon's stronghold on the industry.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is one of the premier cybersecurity companies in the world and seems to be in the right place at the right time. The need for cybersecurity is increasing as the world becomes more digital.\n\nAccording to IBM's \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023,\" the average cost of a data breach globally is $4.45 million, and 51% of organizations plan to increase their cybersecurity spending as a result. That's just data breaches, too, but plenty of other cyberattacks can threaten a company's business.\n\nIBM's report also mentions that organizations which use AI and automation to fight this problem save $1.76 million, compared to organizations that don't. This works in CrowdStrike's favor, as the company is one of the pioneers of solely using AI to fight cyberattacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no doubt CrowdStrike's platforms are effective -- the business results speak for themselves. Around 27% of its clients use seven or more of the products in its ecosystem (called \"modules\"), 43% use six or more, and 64% use five or more. This has helped the company's free cash flow skyrocket during the past few years. CRWD Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nCrowdStrike can still cover a lot more ground in the cybersecurity industry. According to the company and market intelligence firm IDC, the AI-native cybersecurity market is estimated to grow from $100 billion this year to $225 billion by 2028. Of course, CrowdStrike won't capture all of it, but it's poised to be a company that benefits largely from this expected growth.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nDespite some well-documented public relations mishaps, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been a gift to its investors over the past one-and-a-half years. The stock price is up over 450% since its November 2022 slump.\n\nThe owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has positioned itself as a go-to platform for advertisers looking to get their products and services in front of the eyes of Meta's 3.98 billion month active users (MAUs). It's been working wonders for the company recently, too, with its financial health as good as it has ever been by many standards.\n\nMeta has always been a revenue cash cow, but recently, its net income has surged. In 2023, Meta's net income was over $39 billion, up 69% from 2022. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMeta's net income growth relative to its revenue growth shows the company is beginning to operate more efficiently and use its capital more effectively. Meta declared a dividend in February for the first time in its history.\n\nThe company's quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, and I think it wouldn't have started paying it at this point if it didn't intend to increase it annually. Meta is far from a dividend investor's dream, but it can be a true two-for-one for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)?",
        "content": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Amazon.com’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Amazon.com?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Amazon.com seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Amazon.com today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $206.70, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Amazon.com’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Amazon.com generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? AMZN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Amazon.com from their most recent forecasts.

        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) will no longer report membership numbers starting next year — a bombshell move for the streaming industry, which has historically tied company performance to subscriber gains or losses.\n\n\"We've evolved and we're going to continue to evolve,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said about the decision while speaking during the company's first quarter earnings call on Thursday.\n\nAlong with subscribers, the company will also stop reporting a key profitability metric — average revenue per member, or ARM.\n\nPeters cited Netflix's shifting revenue model, which now includes its advertising tier and \"extra member\" fees, as a prime reason for the decision.\n\nThese \"are things that aren't directly connected to the number of members,\" he said.\n\nThe executive added the streamer has also \"evolved our pricing and plans with multiple tiers and different price points across different countries.\" Therefore, he said, \"each incremental member has a different business impact.\"\n\n\"All of that means, by the historical simple math that we all did, the number of members [multiplied by] the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,\" Peters said, although he did note the company will not \"be silent\" on subscribers either.\n\n\"We'll periodically update when we grow and we hit certain major milestones [but] it's just not going to be part of our regular reporting,\" he said.\n\nAlthough tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do.\n\nDisney (DIS) separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ figures, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) reports a combined number for its Max and Discovery+ platform. Paramount Global (PARA) also reveals subscriber figures for its flagship platform Paramount+.\n\n\"The movement to no longer disclose quarterly subscriptions from next year will not go down well; more so given subs growth that the streaming king has seen over the last year,\" PP Foresight tech and media analyst Paolo Pescatore said in an email.\n\nCiti analyst Jason Bazinet added: \"We suspect reduced disclosures may disappoint the Street.\"\n\nIn its first quarter earnings report Thursday, Netflix reported a surge of subscribers, with net additions of 9.3 million blowing past expectations of 4.8 million. This follows the 13 million subs the streamer added in 2023's fourth quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix said the company will continue to focus and report on other metrics, including operating income, operating margins, net income, free cash flow, earnings per share, and revenue.\n\nStory continues FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is shown on one of their Hollywood buildings in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 12, 2023.

        "title": "Meet the CEO who makes your dog-food delivery feel like visiting a Disney resort",
        "content": "There is conflicting evidence about the gravity of the pandemic puppy boom, when it appeared as if nearly everyone had adopted a dog as a lockdown companion. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported that more than 23 million American households—nearly one in five nationwide—adopted a pet during the pandemic, but other localized studies suggest that it wasn’t as big a boom as we thought.\n\nEither way, sentiment about pets has changed. Nearly all U.S. pet owners say their pets are part of their family, according to a July 2023 Pew Research Center survey. And Chewy, the premier pet-care e-commerce company, takes that ball and runs with it by having hyperpersonalized interactions with its customers, whom they fondly call “pet parents.”\n\n“Twenty or thirty years ago, the pet was out on the porch. Today, they're on the couch, they're in your bed. And today, you refer to them as family,” Chewy CEO Sumit Singh told Fortune in a recent Leadership Next podcast interview. Singh refers to this concept as the humanization of pets, which has “led to the consumer wanting to be more aware and feel like a better pet parent.”\n\nHigh-touch customer care\n\nSingh became CEO of Chewy in March 2018 and led the company through its IPO in 2019, raising more than $1 billion in the process. While it’s been a busy six years in the saddle, Singh makes time for direct customer interactions—a task rarely taken on by CEOs. He answers customer emails directly, and ensures they receive intimate attention during the “highs and lows of pet parenting,” like when a beloved pet has died. You may have seen some of these gestures on social media, such as Chewy sending customers flowers, handwritten cards, and even hand-drawn pet portraits.\n\n“We are sympathetic, empathetic,” Singh said. “That moment is a very special moment because most companies will not invest ‘X’ number of dollars to be able to pick up flowers to send to customers and be there in that moment for them.”\n\nBut Singh remains dedicated to this level of care because he wants all Chewy customers to feel as if they’re visiting a Disney park every time they interact with the brand.\n\n“I compare Chewy to the best hospitality resorts in the way that you are served, in the way that you are treated, and the way that you received [service], and in the way that you’re respected when you walk through the hospitality resorts,” Singh said. “We are delivering the scale and convenience of e-commerce but [with] the best personalized service you should expect at the best local neighborhood pet store.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Sumit Singh\n\nSingh grew up in middle-class India with the values of “high respect for education and humility and curiosity and resilience,” he said. But he made his move to America, the “massive, amazing land of opportunity,” and went on to earn his master’s in operations and logistics from the University of Texas at Austin and an MBA from the highly competitive University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nSingh held senior leadership roles at Amazon and Dell, companies which he said are “pioneers in their own fields.” At Amazon, he became a leader to help grow the e-commerce giant’s Fresh grocery business, which was a “very difficult business to crack,” he said, an experience that taught him how to run perishable consumable businesses and manage a “tough” P&L. But one of the non-technical lessons he learned during his time at Amazon was the importance of personalized customer interactions, even at the highest levels of leadership.\n\n“My email is available on LinkedIn. Customers contact me, [which is something] I learned from Jeff Bezos,” Singh said. “We've maintained a culture of innovation, a culture of customer service. I still read every email.”\n\nAnd even in a working world where AI is seemingly affecting customer interactions, Singh sees the nascent technology as more of a “friend” to the company’s existing customer care representatives. In fact, Chewy is currently developing a tool called “CSR Buddy,” which will essentially serve as a prompter tool that has all of the information about the customer and a knowledge base that “will marry content to let [customer care representatives] have more intelligent conversations” with customers, Singh said.\n\n“They shouldn't spend time looking for information,” Singh said. “They should spend time having the conversation. That's the difference.”\n\nUnder Singh’s leadership at Chewy, where he had previously served as chief operating officer from August 2017 to March 2018 before becoming CEO, the company has grown to an $8.3 billion market value—and it was recognized as a 2023 World’s Most Admired Company by Fortune, among the likes of Disney, Amazon, and Apple.\n\nAnd while Singh didn’t necessarily come from an animal-centric career, he recognizes the importance of the companionship a pet offers. Indeed, his 11-year-old shih tzu, named D, is the chief treat tester, and frequents Chewy’s office with him. But D doesn’t let his status get to his furry head among the other pups who come to the workplace with their pet parents.\n\n“I don’t think he realizes he’s that special,” Singh said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Identifying the next growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 is a noteworthy endeavor. The Magnificent 7 refers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have dominated the technology sector for years.\n\nThese mega-cap companies have delivered extraordinary returns, shaping the market and our daily lives. However, as with all empires, some continue to rise and others fall causing a shift in dominance. While these growth stocks listed above aren’t necessarily losing their mojo, a few could be replaced with Wall Street’s next generation of favorites.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is undoubtedly one of the top prospects to become a Magnificent 7 killer over the next decade. The company is at the forefront of the AI revolution, set to deliver superior returns and capital to shareholders.\n\nBroadcom is a titan in the semiconductor industry, with diverse product offerings serving the data center, network, broadband, wireless and industrial markets. They power everything from smartphones to IoT devices. With the growing demand for connectivity and cloud offerings, Broadcom stands tall as a major beneficiary. However, investors are most excited about the company’s AI tailwinds, which are set to accelerate revenue, EPS and FCF from operations. Its customer silicon chip for AI workloads continues to see unprecedented demand, as hyperscalers ramp up its product offerings. Additionally, Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware in 2023 further solidifies its position in the enterprise software market. That makes Broadcom one of the best growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 stocks for years to come.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to showcase its ability to weather storms and emerge as a leading contender for the top growth stocks to challenge the Magnificent 7. The company underwent major restructuring in 2023, and its new business model and cost-cutting efforts have proven material.\n\nNetflix took serious measures to improve many aspects of their business. Firstly, the company cut costs by $300 million in 2023. Secondly, it finally started to crack down on password sharing, which had been a huge crutch to the business. Moreover, its new ad plan membership was a genius move, boosting its global subscribers while allowing the company to appeal to a wider audience. In FY23, Netflix saw record revenue, earnings and FCF. Net earnings increased 21% YOY to $12.03 per share, with FCF up 328% to a record $6.92 billion. The company is not shying away from the competition in streaming, aiming to unlock new revenue growth opportunities in live gaming and sports-adjacent programming. Netflix’s new strategy is working, and investors should not ignore its margin expansion capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the best sleeper AI stocks with incredible long-term potential. Its expansive suite of creative software, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat, is leading the generative AI boom.\n\nAdobe’s tools are indispensable for graphic designers, photographers, videographers and creative professionals. Its transition to a subscription-based model has proven invaluable, ensuring recurring revenue streams while building a loyal customer base. However, the major catalyst for growth is Adobe Sensei GenAI, a co-pilot software to accelerate productivity and design all in one suite. It is well-equipped with market automation, analytics, testing and other AI intelligence to drive outcomes for its customers. The platform continues to gain traction, and its FY23 results only showcased a sliver of its potential. With the profitability and cash flows to drive long-term growth, Adobe remains one of the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN continues to enjoy solid momentum with its cashierless technology by delivering an enhanced shopping experience to customers, which has been the primary factor behind its solid success in the retail sector. The stock has gained 19.3% on a year-to-date basis.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from its latest plan to deploy the technology this year into more third-party stores, including stadium stores and Hudson News locations at airports.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Just Walk Out technology, which allows customers to shop and leave without going through a checkout line, is currently available at 140 establishments.\n\nExpanding Cashierless Technology\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon’s strengthening efforts to bolster the coverage of its cashierless technology.\r\n\r\nWith the underlined technology, the company helps customers save time by avoiding checkout queues and paying for items shopped via their smartphones from anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe company has started deploying the technology at hospital stores as well in order to enable hospital employees and visitors to avail of the same service. It recently rolled out the Just Walk Out technology at St. Joseph’s/Candler Hospital in Savannah, GA.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s deal with Panera Bread, a United States-based cafe chain, to deploy Amazon One across 10-20 Panera cafes remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe strong network of Amazon Go stores, wherein the underlined technology was first introduced, remains a positive. Reportedly, there are 22 Amazon Go stores in the United States, out of which seven are located in Washington.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "7 Must-Have AI Stocks, Fed Rate Cuts or No Fed Rate Cuts",
        "content": "Markets have remained strong in 2024 primarily because of two factors: the emergence of AI stocks and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts this year.\n\nHowever, inflation remains high while other economic signals indicate a strong economy overall. The result is that the Fed can wait to cut rates. In fact, it may. The timeline continues to be pushed back with some pundits suggesting that there may be zero rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThat leads me to believe that investors will redirect their optimism into AI stocks. Those shares will not have the benefit of immediately lower lending rates, however, they benefit from optimism. That optimism suggests that AI is only beginning as a long-term opportunity that will fundamentally change the economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are likely to refocus on the benefits of AI as Fed rate cut hopes dwindle. That should spike demand and prices.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent stock correction is likely to be an opportunity for multiple reasons. First of all, it’s not very serious, and more likely a reflection of current headwinds overall.\n\nThose headwinds include factors like later than expected rate cuts and increased competition from rivals including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nLet’s focus on the latter part of those two factors. Intel just released its latest AI chip called Gaudi 3. Intel claims that the chip is faster and more efficient than Nvidia’s leading H100 chips. It very well may be but the problem is going to be sales. It will be very difficult for Intel and other chip makers to disrupt Nvidia’s dominance. Nvidia did not become the most coveted chip maker by chance. Further, Nvidia is scheduled to release its h200 GPU chips this quarter. Those chips are likely to be superior to Intel’s Gaudi 3 chips. Beyond that, Nvidia is by far the better stock given how successful the company has been in turning AI into earnings. Those earnings jumped by 486% in the December quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has performed exceptionally well over the past year and rebounded very strongly. The company was among the biggest losers during the quantitative tightening era between late 2021 and late 2022.\n\nHowever, Meta Platforms has rebounded. That rebound can be partially attributed to its investment in its Llama AI platform. To be clear, the majority of the rebound is due to the return of advertising revenues that underpin Meta Platform’s business model.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese days, Meta Platforms’ Llama AI model is gaining steam. The firm is set to release Llama 3, the newest iteration of its large language model (LLM). Meta is releasing Llama 3 likely within the next month.\n\nLlama 3 has the potential to be revolutionary. Meta says that the upgrade will be capable of reasoning and planning. That suggests AI is becoming more human overall and  utilitarian. In turn, Meta should be able to better monetize AI, improving its stock as a result. This makes it one of those AI stocks to consider.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) AI prowess and profitability are a potent mix. Again, I believe investors are likely to refocus their capital into AI stocks as the Fed rate cut timeline extends.\n\nThe company is well noted for its AI platforms. Palantir’s ability therein has caused the stock to rise. Palantir is  deserving of the attention it has received due to its fundamental strength. The company has reported five straight quarters of GAAP profitability.\n\nInvestors should look to Palantir for its fundamental success. They should also note that Palantir is quickly shedding its public side reputation and becoming a more commercial, private side endeavor. Commercial revenues grew by 32% in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, government revenues, still high, grew by 11%. This makes it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) moving some of its foundry workloads to the latter firm. The partnership suggests that both Palantir and Oracle are deeply interested in western interests moving forward. The point here being that Palantir is the first choice in regard to that issue and AI.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) stock is very clearly poised to continue heading upward on AI tailwinds. The company is gaining a lot of attention of late for its memory prowess. Its high bandwidth memory (HBM) has quickly become a vital component in the AI race.\n\nMicron was selected as a critical HBM supplier to Nvidia which is an excellent reason to   assume further growth will follow. High bandwidth memory is used to increase the power of AI chips. It is easy to see why Micron then has such a strong opportunity given its connection to Nvidia.\n\nMicron is also benefiting from the premiums associated with that relationship. The company announced that it plans to raise the prices on DRAM and SSD by 25%. Micron is already coming off a stronger than expected quarter and with its new found Nvidia Jr. moniker, is expected to rise much higher. The company should continue to look more attractive as a refocus on AI monetization re-emerges in the wake of recent Fed news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose slower than expected rate cuts should benefit AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock in the near term.  investors are well aware of the narrative that underpins investing in AMD: the company is the primary competitor of Nvidia for AI chips.\n\nAMD offers a balance of comparable chip specifications at much lower prices. It continues to beg the question: will Nvidia’s perceived dominance soon be perceived as greed? The answer is maybe.\n\nIf some sort of seismic shift occurs and tech firms suddenly switch to AMD chips then of course its shares will move much higher. For now, AMD is simply a strong alternative to Nvidia and the company with a huge opportunity ahead.\n\nCEO Lisa Su predicts massive growth in AI data center chip opportunities in the next few years.  AMD’s  chips are in demand for such applications. That is still the best reason to buy AMD even if the company does not surpass Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of a select few companies that doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts. It is of course also one of the strongest AI stocks overall. I do believe that there will be a refocus on AI as mentioned above. and I do believe that will benefit Microsoft.\n\nSo, let’s first talk about the initial claim that Microsoft doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts.  That’s true, one of the primary reasons firms are interested in rate cuts is that lower lending rates emerge following any cut. Lower lending rates spur investments in growth opportunities and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is exceptionally cash rich. So, the company can simply chase opportunities as it sees fit without having to rely on lenders.\n\nThat simple truth is yet another reason to consider investing in Microsoft at the moment. The company is of course one of the strongest AI competitors overall. Its investment in ChatGPT has paid off very well. The company does have some issues relating to monetizing its office suite of products but overall is exceptionally strong.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefits from the same operating cash flow strengths as Microsoft. The stock is similarly attractive for that reason. So, I won’t beat a dead horse and instead will focus on Amazon’s primary AI opportunity which is its cloud network, AWS.\n\nCloud computing has traditionally accounted for a major portion of Amazon’s business. However, demand slowed last year as corporate partners slowed their spending. Amazon is looking for ways to strengthen its AI prowess. The company recently invested an additional $2.75 billion into AI startup Anthropic. That raises its total investment to 4 billion  invested in additional 2.75 billion into AI startup anthropic. that raises its total investment to $4 billion overall. This helps to make it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude AI assistant rivals that of ChatGPT. It’s clear that Amazon hopes to mimic the success of Microsoft in that regard. Overall, Amazon is well positioned as the largest cloud provider. AI investment into cloud workloads is set to strengthen and will benefit Amazon overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Google Cloud was a key growth driver, recording a YoY revenue rise of 26%, with the segment going from losses to becoming profitable with a positive operating income of $864 million amid a tough competitive landscape where it faces off Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\n\nBut, what investors really want to hear this time is how is Google infusing AI into its offerings. During the last earning report. CEO Sundar Pichai focused on the enduring strength of Google Search and the growing power of the Cloud and YouTube, with both of these areas benefiting from AI development in the Gemini era.\n\nAmazon crushed estimates with record holiday sales\n\nView more earnings on META\n\nWith its fourth quarter results that had record Black Friday and Cyber Monday results, Amazon reported its net salesgrew 14% YoY to $170.0 billion, operating income rose to $13.2 billion, and net income swinged from 2022’s Q4 loss to an income of $10.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for 2023 as a whole, net sales expanded 12% and a net income of  $30.4 billion marked the return of profitability. As for first quarter estimates, Amazon guided for sales growth to continue in the range between 8 and 13%, with operating income exceeding prior year’s result.\n\nAlong with the impact of automation efforts and expansion of drone delivery on efficiency and costs, investors will look at the company’s fastest-growing business segment AWS, along with advertising that should both benefit from AI advancements.\n\nAfter a robust fiscal second quarter, Microsoft will show further how its AI advances are fueling innovation and boosting productivity.\n\nWith its second quarter, Microsoft surpassed analyst estimates with both its top and bottom line. Microsoft posted revenue grew 18% to $62.02 billion with earnings per share amounting to $2.93. Operating income and net income both made a 33% jump. This robust performance was greatly owed to the success of the Intelligent Cloud business whose revenue surged 20% YoY, while Azure and related cloud services alone posted an impressive growth of 30%. As for the fiscal third quarter guidance, Microsoft forecasted revenue in the range between $60 billion and $61 billion. But, what will be under the spotlight is the way CEO Satya Nadella’s words are turning into action, as Nadella commented during the last earnings report that Microsoft went from talking to actually applying AI at a scale.\n\nBesides showing their corporate financial health, these earnings reports will also provide valuable insights about the health of the tech industry as a whole, along with a glimpse of the direction in which the world is headed as the new AI era continues to unfold.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "Investing in growth stocks can deliver outsized gains, but investors have to stick with these stocks during volatile stretches. These stocks are more vulnerable to price swings due to macroeconomic factors. These growth stocks to buy now are also held under the microscope each time they report earnings.\n\nInvestors pay more attention to these types of stocks because of the potential payoff. Some growth stocks have become giants within their respective industries while others have the potential to become giants.\n\nIt’s clear why investors buy growth stocks. They want to outperform the stock market. These seven growth stocks to buy now can give you a chance at achieving that objective.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers the world’s most recognizable online marketplace that lists millions of products on its platform. The company processes more than 4,000 product sales every minute.\n\nThe e-commerce segment is Amazon’s main revenue driver, but the company is also seeing plenty of success with its leading cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services has the lion’s share of the cloud computing industry. It has roughly one-third of the total market share and has a big lead over the competition. It’s mostly a duopoly between Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an honorable mention.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its advertising, video streaming, and grocery segments. Amazon recently got accused of attempting to steal Trader Joe’s trade secrets. This isn’t the best look for Amazon, but investors should take note that the company is looking to expand its grocery store footprint through Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. Advertising and streaming are the bigger segments to monitor, but Amazon seems to be putting more effort into its grocery segment. This makes it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSofi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditional bank stocks aren’t considered growth stocks. Those corporations have matured and offer dividend payouts to keep shareholders invested. However, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) isn’t your traditional bank.\n\nThe fintech company operates entirely online, so you can’t drive to a local branch. The company also has many of the financial products you would expect from a big institution. Consumers can get personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, and other products. SoFi has also made great strides in getting mainstream appeal through SoFi Stadium and by becoming the official bank of the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi reported its first profitable quarter in Q4 2023. Net income came to $47.9 million while revenue was $615.4 million. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year and the company ended up with a 7.9% net profit margin. This helps make it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSoFi’s P/E ratio can drop quickly and present value to patient investors. However, you will have to contend with a stock that has dropped by 31% over the past five years and is also down by 25% year-to-date. Rising profits can catch a lot of investors by surprise and potentially result in a surge.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is gaining market share in the beauty industry and has generated significant returns for investors. The stock is up by 83% over the past year and has surged by 1,200% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock trades at a 73 P/E ratio and has impressive financial growth. Revenue increased by 85% year-over-year in Q3 FY24 while net income jumped by 41% year-over-year to reach $26.9 million. The company has double-digit net profit margins.\n\nELF investors got spooked after Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) warned investors of a slower quarter. However, that may not be bad news for Elf Beauty. The company can be using this opportunity to gain market share while another competitor isn’t doing as well. It’s possible that Elf Beauty is still performing well despite Ulta Beauty’s warning. This is a case of Schrödinger’s cat leading up to Elf Beauty’s earnings report. We’ll learn more about the company’s performance when that report comes out. However, the stock looks like a long-term winner that can reward patient investors.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) offers financial software like QuickBooks and TurboTax. The stock has generated an impressive 141% gain over the past five years and is rated as a “Strong Buy.” The stock has a projected 16% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $775 per share implies a 27% gain.\n\nAlthough the stock has been a steady outperformer, shares have been down by roughly 8% since the start of March. It’s entering correction territory and can become more attractive for long-term investors. The stock currently has a 62.5 P/E ratio and a 0.59% dividend yield. The company has an annualized 16.65% dividend growth rate over the past decade.\n\nThe fintech firm continues to grow and reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24. The company reiterated its full-year guidance in the press release. Its largest segment, “Small Business and Self-Employed Group Revenue,” grew by 18% compared to the same period last year.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a software company that helps businesses work more efficiently. The company’s Work Flow technology helps companies stay on top of tasks and create chatbots. ServiceNow generates steady recurring revenue from more than 8,100 enterprise customers with a 99% renewal rate. That customer base includes approximately 85% of the Fortune 500.\n\nThe firm generates high cash flow and is expanding its profit margins. The company exceeded guidance in Q4 2023 with 26% year-over-year revenue growth and 97% year-over-year net income growth. The company has 1,897 customers with annual contract values above $1 million. ServiceNow added 168 customers to that category in Q4 2023 which is a 33% year-over-year improvement in the number of added $1M+ customers.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a 56-forward P/E ratio and has outperformed the stock market over several years. Shares have gained 179% over the past five years. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 15% upside.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has been beating the stock market for a while. The stock is up by 13% year-to-date and has a 208% gain over the past five years. Investors accumulated more shares after the company’s solid Q3 FY24 earnings report.\n\nThe company increased its revenue by 9.9% year-over-year. Meanwhile, net income came in at $397.6 million which was a 22.0% year-over-year increase. Cintas’ profit margins are expanding, and the company still has growth opportunities.\n\nCintas provides business supplies and safety equipment for more than one million businesses in North America. The company’s revenue is well-diversified due to the large customer base, but Cintas can continue to reach additional businesses in North America.\n\nThe company hiked its annual revenue exceptions from a range of $9.48 to $9.56 billion to $9.57 billion to $9.60 billion after the latest earnings report. Higher revenue and diluted EPS expectations have investors excited and spell out a promising long-term opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is up by 44% year-to-date and many analysts believe that the stock can march higher. The social media giant has a projected 9% upside from its current price. Meta Platforms is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 43 analysts. The highest price target of $600 per share suggests a potential 20% gain.\n\nThe company continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while delivering substantial profit margin expansion. Revenue jumped by 25% year-over-year in Q4 2023 while net income more than tripled compared to the same period last year.\n\nMore people continue to create accounts for Meta Platforms’ family of apps. Family daily active users increased by 8% year-over-year while monthly active users jumped by 6% year-over-year. Instagram and WhatsApp are delivering higher growth rates than Facebook.\n\nThe corporation is committed to increasing shareholder value based on its $20.03 billion stock buyback in full-year 2023. The recently issued dividend can also attract dividend growth investors who want to get paid for holding onto their favorite stocks. This also makes it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, ELF, and NOW.

        "title": "7 Michael Burry Stocks to Buy if You’re Looking for Deep Value",
        "content": "While you should never invest based on any one metric or person’s guidance, a possible exception can be made for Michael Burry stocks. Granted, you still need to conduct your own due diligence. Still, the reclusive hedge fund manager tends to win big with his contrarian trades.\n\nOf course, we all know Burry from his exploits featured in the book and film “The Big Short.” However, the investment genius – who also holds a medical degree from Vanderbilt – has made many other picks as well. Indeed, he was investing in meme stocks before that term even materialized. In other words, he knows how to read the market.\n\nNow, I’m not going to say that he’s 100% correct – no one has that kind of record. However, he definitely knows his stuff. Below are several Michael Burry stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nBased on the latest 13F disclosure documents, technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) represents 5.2% of the hedge fund manager’s portfolio. Now, whether it ranks as one of the Michael Burry stocks or not, GOOGL is a compelling enterprise. Primarily, its ownership of the internet through its Google search engine (along with the ecosystem) makes Alphabet a formidable investment.\n\nTo be sure, GOOGL probably won’t make you rich overnight. However, it’s a solid idea for the long haul thanks to its consistency. Last fiscal year, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in the first quarter, when it posted earnings per share of $1.17 against a target of $1.07.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are targeting EPS of $6.82, a significant bump from last year’s result of $5.80. On the top line, they’re looking at revenue of $342.8 billion, up 11.4%. In fairness, GOOGL is a bit pricey at 6.39X trailing-year revenue. Still, it carries a strong buy rating with a high-side price target of $185.\n\nCitigroup (C) The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.\n\nSource: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn intriguing idea among Michael Burry stocks, Citigroup (NYSE:C) makes up 5.4% of the hedge fund manager’s portfolio. The financial sector has operated under a skeptical cloud considering last year’s regional banking crisis. However, the series of better-than-expected jobs reports could favor the major financial institutions. More people having jobs means that rate hikes might not be coming soon, potentially improving lenders’ profitability.\n\nCitigroup in particular has benefited from its consistent performance. In the past four quarters, the company’s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 17.4%. Notably, the company’s Q1 print was impressive, producing EPS of $1.58 against a consensus view of $1.23.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are now looking at EPS of $5.77. That’s a solid improvement over last year’s print of $5.52. On the top line, revenue could hit $80.41 billion, up 11.2% from 2023’s tally of $72.32 billion. Also, the high-side sales estimate calls for $81.2 billion.\n\nLastly, it’s worth noting that Citigroup offers a forward yield of 3.72%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOperating under the infrastructure software industry, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments worldwide. It’s one of the Michael Burry stocks possibly due to underlying artificial intelligence investments. Oracle’s cloud service is incorporate generative AI to offer utility across a wide range of use cases.\n\nRight now, ORCL represents 5.6% of Burry’s portfolio. Admittedly, it’s not the most exciting idea in terms of financial performances. However, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 3.23% in the past four quarters.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS of $5.59, above last year’s result of $5.12. On the revenue front, they believe the company is capable of ringing up $53.25 billion. That’s up 6.6% from last year’s haul of $49.95 billion. Notably, for fiscal 2025, the consensus projection calls for sales of $57.7 billion.\n\nOverall, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $138.61 price target, implying almost 17% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPractically pioneering the e-commerce business model, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has blossomed into myriad other innovation spheres. Some would also call the company controversial for effectively dominating the business landscape, putting smaller companies out of business. Still, Wall Street isn’t a place to make friends. It’s also one of the Michael Burry stocks, representing 4.8% of his portfolio.\n\nWhile AMZN is no longer the exciting new tech name to speculate on, it still offers tremendous relevance. Perhaps most notably, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales has steadily increased since Q2 2022. That’s despite the consumer headwinds of inflation and elevated borrowing costs. So, that puts Amazon in the driver’s seat. Last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise shot up to 55.15%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.13 on revenue of $641.35 billion. That’s a notable improvement across the board compared to last year’s results of $2.90 EPS on sales of $574.78 billion. To no one’s shock, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean representing TOPS stock\n\nSource: VladSV / Shutterstock.com\n\nA shipping company, Star Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) engages in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide. Per the company’s public profile, its vessels transport a range of bulk commodities, including iron ores, minerals and grains, bauxite, fertilizers and steel products. Should the global economy improve, SBLK could be one of the top-performing Michael Burry stocks.\n\nRight now, SBLK stock represents 4.9% of Burry’s portfolio. Given the reclusive market expert’s penchant for thought-provoking tweets (often with a downcast tone), the acquisition of Star Bulk is a curious one. Last fiscal year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 7%. However, the performance is volatile, badly missing in Q2 while knocking it out of the park in Q1 and Q3.\n\nLooking ahead to end of fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS of $4.04. That’s a significant increase from last year’s result of $1.84. Also, the top line could expand 6.3% to $1.01 billion. And in the following year, revenue could hit $1.12 billion, implying nearly 11% up from projected 2024 sales.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese e-commerce company, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) represents one of the two massive business-to-consumer online retailers in China by transaction volume and revenue. However, there are concerns about the underlying market’s economy. As a result, JD stock suffered a decline of almost 8% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s down more than 33%.\n\nStill, I would classify JD.com as more of a classic example of Michael Burry stocks. Should China’s economy perform better than expected, JD could rise substantially. Providing some hope for this narrative is the company’s earnings performance last year. In the past four quarters, it posted an average positive earnings surprise of 20.13%. That’s impressive.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $3.16, a solid improvement over last year’s print of $3.06. Revenue may land at $160.13 billion, up 6.9% from 2023’s tally of $149.84 billion. Experts also peg JD stock a moderate buy with a $37.97 price target, implying 51% upside potential.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother Chinese e-commerce and technology juggernaut, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is essentially its home nation’s flagship enterprise. Invariably, then, it commands much attention from Wall Street. It also happens to be the top idea for Michael Burry stocks. Right now, it represents 6.1% of the investor’s portfolio.\n\nFundamentally, it’s another classic example of what Burry typically targets: underappreciated ideas with significant upside potential. However, prospective investors face notable challenges. In particular, BABA stock suffered a loss of 8% since the start of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it has lost 28% of equity value. Whether it recovers depends of course on the trajectory of the Chinese economy.\n\nWith that in mind, the company provides some encouragement with generally solid performances. In the last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise came out to 8.38%. For the current year, analysts are seeking EPS of $8.64 on revenue of $130 billion. That’s a solid improvement from last year’s results of $7.64 EPS on sales of $121.63 billion.\n\nFinally, analysts rate BABA a strong buy with a $104.49 price target, implying almost 52% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This service is meant for reshaping the supply chain strategies of various enterprises and reducing traditional logistics hurdles.\r\n\r\nThis solution allows buyers to compare real-time quotes from various logistics service providers, book tailored solutions, and view verified options like customs clearance, storage, combined shipments and drop shipping.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it includes \"Send Inquiry\" and \"Logistics RFQ\" features for sellers, streamlining their process of partnering with freight forwarders.\r\n\r\nHence, Alibaba is expected to gain solid traction across SMEs in the United States on the back of its latest move which will help these businesses to expand their global reach.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nStrengthening Logistics Services Aids Growth\n\nApart from the launch of Logistics Marketplace, Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao announced the launch of a \"consolidated shipping\" service in the United States, bolstering its overseas logistics offerings.\r\n\r\nThe cross-border service packages multiple shopping orders from various Chinese e-commerce platforms and delivers them to U.S. customers via air and sea transport routes, reducing delivery times to as little as five days.\r\n\r\nThe company’s launch of Cainiao Express, a new express delivery service, remains noteworthy. It aims to offer doorstep, half-day, same-day and next-day deliveries to select Alibaba-owned businesses.\r\n\r\nAlibaba Group also revealed its plans to invest $1.1 billion in South Korea over three years in its quest to build a logistics center and expand businesses across the country. The company further announced that it would invest $200 million this year for the development of the logistics center and $100 million for small and mid-sized firms.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors are expected to aid the company in capitalizing on the growth opportunities present in the global logistics market. Per an Allied Market Research report, the global logistics market is expected to reach $16.79 trillion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 5.6% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects of Alibaba in the promising logistics market will likely strengthen the company’s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $130.77 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 3.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nHowever, Alibaba faces stiff competition from notable industry players like Amazon AMZN and JD.com JD in the logistics market space. Its shares have lost 11.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s return of 6.4%.\r\n\r\nAmazon introduced an end-to-end supply chain service called \"Supply Chain by Amazon,\" allowing third-party sellers to pick up inventory, ship across borders, handle customs clearance, store bulk inventory and deliver to customers.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the company launched Amazon Shipping, a ground shipping service for sellers, offering delivery on orders on Amazon.com, sellers' websites, and other channels, covering domestic shipments within the United States.\r\n\r\nJD.com, on the other hand, recently announced that its logistics arm, JD Logistics expanded its international express delivery service from Guangzhou and Shenzhen to nearly every district in China. The service offers efficient logistics solutions for various products, including documents and apparel, among others, with the United States, the U.K. and Germany as top destinations.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the company announced its partnership with Geopost to bolster its global logistics capabilities. The partnership will allow seamless C2C and B2C shipping services between China and Europe, providing comprehensive tracking, delivery and one-stop express solutions for individuals and businesses.\n\nZacks Rank & Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the same sector is The Gap GPS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Stocks Peter Lynch Would Love",
        "content": "One of the greatest investors of our time is Peter Lynch. He took Fidelity Magellan from $20 million in assets under management (AUM) in 1977 to $14 billion AUM in 1990 when he retired, a 29% annual average return over that period. This has led us to create this list of under-the-radar stocks for investors.\n\nLynch also wrote two of the best value investing books that distilled his simple investment philosophy into an accessible medium. “One Up on Wall Street” and “Beating the Street” are still important investment guides any investor can use today.\n\nIn short, Lynch didn’t want to overpay for stocks, preferring to buy them at a discount. Yet he wanted businesses that exhibited financial discipline and saw profits grow over time. He also liked looking in out-of-the-way spots for his stock picks. Below are three Peter Lynch stocks that seem to tick all the boxes. Let’s find out if they’re right for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCactus (WHD)\n\nCactus (NYSE:WHD) is a small but growing player in the oilfield services industry dominated by the likes of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and SLB (NYSE:SLB). While it sells pressure control equipment for wellheads, recent periods have seen the oil and gas industry reduce the number of rig counts in operation despite soaring prices.\n\nThat’s the new economics of the industry. Drillers like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are limiting capital expenditures to maintain profitability instead of going through a boom-and-bust cycle. Now they focus on their most profitable fields while seeking more measured expansion.\n\nIn the most recent survey, Baker Hughes reported 617 rigs in operation, three fewer than the week before and 131 less than last year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude sells for $84 a barrel today, 6% above last year’s price.\n\nTo compensate for these kinds of swings, Cactus acquired FlexSteel, a manufacturer of ​​spoolable pipe technologies. It diversifies Cactus’ operations while offering significant growth potential because of the complementary services it provides with Cactus’s legacy product line and the inroads it has already made with industry majors.\n\nAt just 15 times next year’s earnings estimates, a fraction of Wall Street’s estimated earnings growth rates and just 11x the free cash flow Cactus produces, this is a stock that Lynch could love. If you are looking for under-the-radar stocks, start here.\n\nHudson Technologies (HDSN)\n\nI’ve been watching Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) for some time now, and though early in my call on the inflection point for the stock (read, wrong), I still believe it is imminent.\n\nStory continues\n\nHudson is the biggest player in the green refrigerant market with a 35% share. In 2020, Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, a law that phases out virgin hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), so-called greenhouse gases that contribute to supposed global warming. By 2036, the federal EPA wants HFCs to be reduced by 85%. That forced reduction is going to lead to shortages of popular refrigerants like R-410A and R-134a could surface, affecting prices. The former is one of the most popular refrigerants in the country and is typically used in a home’s central air conditioning system. The latter is used in most automobile AC systems.\n\nThat’s where Hudson Technologies comes in. As the law cuts into available supplies, demand for reclaimed refrigerants will grow. Hudson saw business spike when the law was first enacted, but saw the fear gradually subsided when refrigerants didn’t immediately evaporate. Because it is a phased-in law, the hysteria will mount once more as greater swaths of supply are removed from the market. Hudson stock should grow alongside the return of the industry’s mounting concern.\n\nThe stock trades at eight times earnings estimates, at a fraction of earnings growth rates and just 8x FCF. Hudson isn’t a household name yet but because of the government’s actions, it likely will be soon. This is easily one of the top under-the-radar stocks.\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nOkay, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) isn’t the most obscure name in stocks but because it is an e-commerce platform in China it isn’t front-of-mind with most people the way Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is. It also trades at massive discounts that are tough to ignore particularly with some large catalysts approaching.\n\nJD and sister online retailer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) saw their shares crumble under relentless government attacks on technology stocks. The ongoing sluggishness of the Chinese economy also weighed heavily on their shares. Yet Beijing finally relented in its pursuit of corruption and is pushing for stimulus programs to bolster consumers. Bloomberg reports the government’s budget plan for the coming year holds an even bigger stimulus package than many expect.\n\nThat could be perfect timing for JD.com’s annual 618 annual shopping extravaganza. Named for the company’s founding (June 18), last year it ran from the end of May to mid-June. Think of it as Amazon Prime Day on steroids. Analysts estimate JD sold around $60 billion worth of merchandise last year. It should launch again in the next month or so.\n\nJD.com stock goes for just seven times earnings estimates, a fraction of earnings growth estimates and an even smaller fraction of sales. This just might be the biggest no-brainer Peter Lynch stock on the list. Improve your portfolio with these under-the-radar stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in XOM and CVX stock.

        "content": "Amazon Aims to Outdo Walmart's Retail Game, Boosts Cashierless Tech in Stores\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced plans to significantly expand its “Just Walk Out” cashierless shopping technology in third-party stores throughout the year, aiming to more than double its current deployment from 140 stores.\n\nThis technology lets customers shop without waiting at a register. They scan an app to enter and automatically pay for their items as they leave.\n\nAmazon clarified that the receipt generation process is automated through computer vision algorithms, though human reviewers are involved in enhancing accuracy, Reuters reports.\n\nThe decision to extend Walk Out technology to more external locations, including stadiums and Hudson News at airports, contrasts with Amazon’s strategy for its Fresh grocery stores.\n\nHere, Amazon plans to replace the technology with “smart” shopping carts that log purchases and charge customers upon exit, noting that Fresh customers tend to spend more when using these carts.\n\nThe move is part of Amazon’s efforts to compete with retail giants like Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), especially after it acquired Whole Foods in 2017 for over $13 billion.\n\nAnalysts noted the company’s shift from Walk Out technology to Dash Carts in most Fresh stores due to the former’s limitations in larger formats.\n\nThey highlighted Amazon’s senior VP of grocery stores reporting a positive customer response to the real-time spending feedback provided by Dash Carts, unlike the delayed receipt issue with ‘Just Walk Out.’\n\nAnalysts also flagged Amazon revamping its Fresh locations with more appealing designs and customer-centric features, including coffee shops, as part of its evolving grocery strategy.\n\nAnalysts noted that smart carts could offer additional advertising revenue opportunities for Amazon.\n\nAmazon stock gained over 77% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Consumer Discretionary (NYSE:XLY) and ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSE:ONLN).\n\nPrice Action: AMZN shares traded higher by 0.29% at $181.80 premarket on the last check Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon Aims to Outdo Walmart's Retail Game, Boosts Cashierless Tech in Stores originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "7 Stocks Poised to Profit From the Red-Hot Job Market",
        "content": "The concept of stocks for a hot job market comes at an awkward juncture. From the perspective of the Federal Reserve, it sought an excuse to raise interest rates. Now, with nonfarm payrolls coming in hotter than anticipated, it may not be impossible for a policy pivot to occur.\n\nStill, one alternative proposal is that the central bank may take a modest approach to financial engineering. If so, the robust labor market – while carrying inflationary implications – offers one significant positive: more people have more money to spend. And that extra cash will almost certainly work its way into the economy.\n\nEven with the challenges that we have, Americans continue to spend. Indeed, we’re spending money we don’t have, with credit card debt skyrocketing to $1.13 trillion. Yet the machine keeps marching onward. If you believe that the music won’t stop, below are the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHF Sinclair (DINO) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my opinion, the bullish case for HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) sells itself. An independent energy company, HF Sinclair produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and many other petroleum-based products. Thus, it’s a downstream operator, meaning that it focuses on the marketing and refining end of the hydrocarbon value chain. Stated differently, if it goes in your car, it’s downstream.\n\nOne of the cynical factors that make DINO a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market is the broader economic backdrop. Yes, electric vehicles are becoming more commonplace. However, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered vehicles. Further, when discussing new energy vehicles, it’s hybrids that have dominated the discourse. Guess what? Hybrids need gasoline.\n\nWith more people having jobs, workers make enough to afford the rising prices of gasoline. However, they’re not making so much that they can make the jump to EVs. Therefore, DINO’s assessment as a moderate buy is quite reasonable. Wall Street’s experts believe shares can rise to $66, with the high-side target hitting $78.\n\nCarmax (KMX) a Carmax (KMX) sign on a storefront\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven the recent volatility in used-car dealership Carmax (NYSE:KMX), KMX seems an unusually risky idea for stocks for a hot job market. Indeed, management didn’t offer an encouraging outlook during its most recent earnings call. Further, inflation remains hot (naturally) and borrowing costs are also elevated. This dynamic is hampering demand for big-ticket items.\n\nHowever, the reality is that vehicles – whether they be combustion powered or otherwise – are mechanical products. Mechanical products eventually wear down or in the case of EVs don’t hold their charge. Now, in certain parts of the country (mainly in the east coast), you can get away without having a personal vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nTry that in California or anywhere else. You’re just not going to get that far. And so, we come across a harsh reality: used cars may be an inevitability.\n\nSure, the latest projections for the current fiscal year call for earnings per share of $3.41 on sales of $26.64 billion. That implies very modest growth on the top line. However, because of the necessity of personal transportation, the high-side metrics of $4.10 EPS on revenue of $28.58 billion isn’t out of the question.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the challenges associated with consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is commoditization. When the company launched its first iPhone, it truly revolutionized the world. It singlehandedly pioneered an entirely new product category. Then came other smart devices, which have done the company so well. However, these devices are no longer special and cheaper copycats have sprouted everywhere.\n\nThat said, what I appreciate about the “fruit” brand is that it commands social cachet. It’s not just about the devices but the underlying Apple ecosystem. Therefore, with the unemployment rate coming in lower than expected, people may be incentivized to boost their discretionary spending. If so, I can see Apple leveraging this social cachet to its advantage.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $6.55, a noticeable bump up from last year’s print of $6.13. Now, the top line is much more modest, with projected sales of $386.51 billion less than 1% up from fiscal 2023’s result. However, fiscal 2025 could see sales jump to nearly $412 billion. Thus, AAPL could rank among the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that needs no introduction, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represents one of the top stocks for a hot job market. Fundamentally, the company pioneered the e-commerce revolution. What’s remarkable is that post-pandemic, consumers have gravitated toward online transactions. Significantly, e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales have been steadily rising since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nBack during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis (Q2 2020), this metric soared to a record 16.5%. It will be difficult to match that level of scope and scale. Yet we’re close, with e-commerce transactions coming in at 15.6% of total sales in Q4 2023. Conspicuously, this rise occurred during a period of rising inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nIt’s possible that consumers may have acclimated to the inflationary paradigm. If so, AMZN could be a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market. With the unemployment rate so low, people could resume their obsession with online transactions.\n\nPresently, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy with a $212.21 average price target. It’s a reasonable assessment given the underlying relevance.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on broader economic challenges, I’ve been skeptical about the prospects for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Yes, it’s pretty much the reason for existence among suburban America. It may be responsible for maintaining the mental health of white-collar office workers. Yet its caffeinated products are heavily overpriced. You know what I’m talking about if you go to one.\n\nStill, a combination of a robust labor market and broader normalization trends (i.e. return to office) could inspire the need for psychological rewards. People need their caffeine to lift their spirits and admittedly, Starbucks’ products feature an addictive nature. Your brain fills with endorphins the moment you walk in. That’s probably by design.\n\nCovering experts believe the company’s EPS will land at $4.04 in fiscal 2024. That’s a big improvement over last year’s print of $3.54. Also, sales could clock in at $38.75 billion, up 7.7% from 2023’s tally of $35.98 billion.\n\nWhat’s notable is that in fiscal 2025, analysts are seeking revenue of $42.46 billion, up 10% from projected 2024 sales. So, it could be one of the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAn intriguing but risky idea for stocks for a hot job market, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) could potentially benefit from the increase in discretionary funds. To be clear, it’s not an argument without downside concerns. With so many Americans deeply indebted, one of the easiest budget items to cut is entertainment.\n\nThat said, an increase in the employment rate suggests that people will be looking to blow off some steam during happy hours or the weekends. From that angle, DRI stock could make sense. Also, it’s important to consider Darden’s acquisition of premium steakhouse Ruth’s Chris. This buyout could help Darden target the higher-income crowd, who may be looking for distinct experiences.\n\nAnalysts are overall bullish on DRI stock, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Further, for the current fiscal year, they’re anticipating EPS of $8.85, a big improvement over last year’s print of $7.99. As for the top line, the experts are targeting sales of $11.41 billion, up almost 9% from the prior year.\n\nUniversal Technical Institute (UTI) Black college graduation cap laying on a pile of $100 and $20 dollar bills\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/zimmytws\n\nAlthough the labor market is booming, not everyone will win out. That’s just economic reality. On a related point, not everyone will be satisfied with their income. I’d venture to say that with the inflationary pressures, most people are dissatisfied with their compensation. And that’s where Universal Technical Institute (NYSE:UTI) comes into play. Basically, the company provides real skills that are in high demand.\n\nThe company provides vocational education geared toward the transportation or mobility space. What’s really intriguing here is the fading demand for plug-in electric-powered vehicles. Stated differently, combustion-based platforms should enjoy extended relevancy. That means the addressable market for mechanics may be larger than previously anticipated.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking EPS of 70 cents. That’s a huge leap up from last year’s result of 13 cents EPS. Also, revenue is expected to land at $716.09 million. That’s up 17.9% from 2023’s haul of $607.41 million.\n\nFinally, analysts rate UTI a unanimous strong buy with a $17.60 price target. It’s one of the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc.

Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism.

FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”\n\n14. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 31.15%\n\nNext on our list of the best low cost ETFs is the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR), which aims to reflect the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which includes small-cap US stocks.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\n\n10.

        "title": "Betting on US Big Tech? Top Earnings Reports to Watch in the Coming Week",
        "content": "These heavyweights, who belong to the “Magnificent 7,” are very likely to generate market buzz with the release of their financial results. Let’s take a closer look at what these earnings might reveal and how they could shape the tech landscape in 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms’ Q1 2024 – 24/04/2024 Post Market\n\nMeta Platforms exceeded expectations in February 2024 with an exceptional performance in Q4. Sales surged by 25% year-over-year to reach $40.1 billion, marking the company’s most rapid growth since mid-2021 and surpassing analyst estimates of $39.18 billion. A cost-cutting initiative accompanied this revenue increase, resulting in an 8% year-over-year decrease in expenses to $23.73 billion.\n\nConsequently, the company’s operating margin more than doubled, reaching a robust 41%, underscoring the effectiveness of their strategies to enhance profitability. This financial strength translated into a substantial increase in net income, which more than tripled to $14 billion ($5.33 per share) compared to $4.65 billion ($1.76 per share) in the previous year, surpassing analyst expectations of $4.96 EPS.\n\nMeta Platforms also maintained a “good” user base with 2.11 billion daily active users (DAUs) and 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in Q4 2023. Additionally, the company’s average revenue per user (ARPU) reached $13.12.\n\nIn addition to its financial achievements, it also announced its inaugural dividend payment of $0.50 per share, signalling a potential transition towards a regular dividend payout model in the future.\n\nThe company anticipates total revenue for the first quarter of 2024 to fall within the range of $34.5-37 billion.\n\nMeta’s shares are already up more than 42.50% since the beginning of the year. Daily Meta Chart as of the 17/04/2024 – Source: ActivTrader\n\nAlphabet’s Q1 2024 – 25/04/2024 Post Market\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, reported positive results for Q4 2023 in January 2024. Net income surged 52% year-over-year, reaching $20.7 billion ($1.64 per share) compared to $13.6 billion ($1.05 per share) in Q4 2022. This growth was accompanied by an improvement in profitability, with the operating margin expanding to 27% from 24%.\n\nA key driver of growth was Google Cloud, which saw revenue rise 26% year-over-year. This segment is now generating profits, marking a significant turnaround from previous losses as it competes with industry giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In Q4 2023, Google Cloud achieved a positive operating income of $864 million, a stark contrast to the $186 million loss recorded in the same period last year.\n\nInvestors are keen to hear from CEO Sundar Pichai regarding his continued focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and integrating new generative AI tools into Google’s core products. Pichai emphasised both Google Search’s enduring strength and the growing importance of YouTube and Cloud in the last earning report. These areas are benefiting from AI investments and advancements ushered in by the “Gemini era.” This commitment to AI across platforms positions Google for long-term success in the competitive digital landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket participants expect EPS to slow down at $1.52 and revenue to slow down at $78.68B.\n\nAlphabet’s shares are already up more than 12.40% since the beginning of the year. Daily Alphabet Chart as of the 17/04/2024 – Source: ActivTrader\n\nAmazon’s Q1 2024 – 25/04/2024 Post Market\n\nAmazon crushed Q4 2023 expectations, with record holiday sales (record-breaking Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping events) driving a 14% year-over-year net sales jump to $170.0 billion. Operating income surged to $13.2 billion, and the company swung to a net income of $10.6 billion ($1.00 per diluted share) compared to a loss in Q4 2022.\n\nFor the full year 2023, net sales grew 12% and profitability returned with a net income of $30.4 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon anticipates continued sales growth (8-13%) in Q1 2024 and expects operating income to exceed the prior year’s figure.\n\nInvestors should watch Amazon’s automation efforts (over 750,000 robots deployed) and its expansion of drone delivery in the United States and other countries like Italy and the United Kingdom in 2024, both potentially impacting efficiency and costs.\n\nAdditionally, as always, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising sales remain key areas of focus, especially with the growing interest in artificial intelligence and AWS’s position as the company’s fastest-growing business line.\n\nAmazon’s shares are already up more than 20.80% since the beginning of the year. Daily Amazon Chart as of the 17/04/2024 – Source: ActivTrader\n\nMicrosoft’s Q3 2024 – 25/04/2024 Post Market\n\nIn its Q2 2024 earnings report released in January, Microsoft surpassed analyst projections on both earnings per share ($2.93 compared to an expected $2.78) and revenue ($62.02 billion versus an expected $61.12 billion).\n\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment, featuring Azure and other cloud services, emerged as a pivotal driver of this success. Revenue surged by 20% year-over-year, with Azure and related cloud services soaring by 30%. Overall, revenue spiked by 18% (16% in constant currency), operating income surged by 33%, net income saw a corresponding 33% increase, and earnings per share leaped by 33%.\n\nMicrosoft’s robust Q2 performance was underscored by its Azure cloud business, which continued to exhibit remarkable strength. The company’s outlook for the fiscal third quarter anticipates revenue in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion.\n\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, emphasised in the press release, “We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.” This strategic shift signals a focus on leveraging AI technologies to drive innovation and enhance productivity. Investors are likely to follow Microsoft’s advancements in this area, viewing them as pivotal tools to attract new clientele and bolster efficiency gains.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares are already up more than 11.00% since the beginning of the year.

        "title": "The Most Active Stock Trader in Congress Is Buying Shares of This Magnificent Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. Although the major stock indexes have lengthy track records of increasing in value over the long run, we've navigated two bear markets since this decade began.\n\nWhen the going gets tough on Wall Street, investors -- including members of Congress -- have often turned their attention to time-tested, industry-leading businesses that offer a rich history of outperformance. While the \"FAANG stocks\" are a perfect example of what I'm talking about, it's companies enacting stock splits that investors (and lawmakers) have gravitated to. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (including lawmakers) are flocking to stock-split stocks for a good reason\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, all without any impact to its market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic maneuver that can make a company's shares more nominally affordable to everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange, as would be seen with a reverse-stock split.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, most investors tend to hone in on companies enacting forward splits. While there are select instances where companies enacting reverse splits have gone on to be phenomenal investments (perhaps none more so than online travel booking site Booking Holdings), companies enacting forward-stock splits are typically firing on all cylinders from an operating standpoint.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, almost one dozen high-profile companies have completed or announced a forward split. Some of the most-prominent of these companies includes e-commerce behemoth Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), internet search giant Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and North American electric-vehicle (EV) kingpin Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Amazon and Alphabet enacted 20-for-1 respective stock splits, while Tesla completed a 3-for-1 forward split. AMZN Chart\n\nWhat these companies share is easily identifiable competitive advantages that have helped them outperform over long periods.\n\nAmazon accounted for nearly 38% of estimated online retail sales in the U.S. in 2023. But more importantly, it's the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading global cloud infrastructure service platform. Even though AWS accounted for \"only\" a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it generated two-thirds of the company's operating income. Alphabet's Google gobbled up an impressive 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, and hasn't gone a month without securing at least a 90% share of global internet search in nine years. It's also the parent of YouTube, the second most-visited social site on the planet. Tesla is the first automaker to have successfully built itself from the ground up to mass production in well over a half-century. It produced almost 1.85 million EVs last year and is the only pure-play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, it's not hard to see why everyday investors and lawmakers alike have flocked to stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCongress' most active stock trader is buying shares of this magnificent stock-split stock\n\nThanks to the STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers to report their trading activity of $1,000 or more within 45 days, retail investors can keep tabs on what our elected officials are buying and selling. Based on periodic transaction reports, we've learned that Congress' most active trader, House Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), has been buying shares of the most-prominent stock-split stock of 2024: retail giant Walmart(NYSE: WMT).\n\nKhanna is a busy representative from a stock trading standpoint. In 2023, he made 4,253 trades, based on data from Capitol Trades. For context, this is over twice as many trades as the second most active stock trader in Washington, D.C., Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who completed 1,826 trades last year.\n\nAccording to filings, Khanna acquired between $50,000 and $100,000 worth of Walmart common stock on Oct. 31, 2023, another $15,000 to $50,000 in shares on Jan. 10, 2024, and between $15,000 and $50,000 in shares on Feb. 13, 2024.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy about Khanna's final purchase is it came after Walmart had announced its plans to conduct a 3-for-1 forward split.\n\nDoug McMillon, the president and CEO of Walmart, noted in his company's press release announcing the split that:\n\nSam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates. Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.\n\nWalmart completed its 3-for-1 split prior to start of trading on February 26.\n\nStock-split stock Walmart offers clear competitive advantages, but its shares are now pricey\n\nAside from generating plenty of buzz from its stock split, Walmart has historically used its size as its biggest competitive edge.\n\nAlthough size doesn't always matter in the business world, having deep pockets can come in particularly handy for retailers. Being able to buy products in large quantities helps Walmart reduce its per-unit costs and, ultimately, lowers the sales price of those items. The company's draw with consumers has long been its ability to undercut traditional grocery stores and local mom-and-pop shops on price.\n\nWalmart's stores aren't tiny, either. The company purchases groceries and products for the home that draw in all types of consumers. Its expansive product offerings drive home the idea that it can be a one-stop shopping destination for consumers.\n\nWalmart is also benefiting from its aggressive investments in technology. This includes everything from improving the online ordering process for its customers to smoothing out the kinks in its supply chain to ensure that its stores have the right merchandise. WMT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the long run, Walmart has proven it's a phenomenal business. But as things stand right now, Walmart's stock is, arguably, pricey.\n\nAlthough stock-split stocks typically command a valuation premium because of their undeniable competitive advantages, a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 may be the upper bound for a company not outpacing the rate of inflation by much in the growth department.\n\nFor example, excluding currency movements, Walmart registered sales growth of 4.9% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31, 2024). Wall Street analysts are forecasting sales growth of roughly 4% in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. All three of these figures aren't much higher than the prevailing rate of inflation in the U.S. In other words, there's not much in the way of true organic growth from Walmart, even with its e-commerce sales booming.\n\nWhile patient investors in Walmart should do just fine, active traders, like House Rep.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), one stock that is absolutely hard to ignore is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company almost single-handedly kicked off the AI revolution by developing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make AI possible. The results of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) help illustrate its uncontested success. Revenue of $61 billion soared 126% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 surged 586%.\n\nI have no doubts that Nvidia will continue to succeed, but others have doubts. The potential for cyclicality in the chip industry, a frothy valuation, and rising fears of competition have some investors looking for viable alternatives, and following the example of a successful money manager might provide ideas.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb made his bones as the CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. From seed capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb spun that into a financial empire worth $6.6 billion. He's made no secret about his feelings regarding AI, which he views as \"transformational,\" and believes a \"profound economic upheaval\" is under way. While there are many stocks that will reap the benefits of generative AI, a quick look at Third Point's holdings reveals three that have the Loeb seal of approval -- and none of them are named Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Microsoft -- 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) deserves at least partial credit for helping to spark the AI revolution by integrating AI across a wide range of its cloud and software offerings. There's perhaps no bigger potential opportunity for the company than that represented by Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of tools that help automate and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks, thereby boosting productivity. According to Microsoft, demand has been off the charts and users seem to love it.\n\nLoeb has been incredibly bullish and has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed about 9% of its position in Microsoft in Q4, even as the value of the position rose -- thanks in part to the stock's 19% gains during the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a modest premium at 34 times earnings, but the company has only just begun to reap the rewards of its AI strategy, and Loeb obviously believes it's worth every penny -- and so do I.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb has been a firm believer in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which he first invested in years ago. He provided insight into his thinking in early 2022. At the time, the company's market cap clocked in at $1.6 trillion, and Loeb opined that the company had $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He estimated that the e-commerce segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- its cloud infrastructure segment -- was worth another $1.5 trillion. For context, Amazon's current market cap is $1.9 trillion, so there's still significant upside ahead.\n\nLoeb believes the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of generative AI is that there will be \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" in order to tap the large language models that underpin AI -- including those offered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He called cloud services the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold'.\"\n\nLoeb also trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% but, like Microsoft, the total value of his stake actually rose, thanks to a 20% increase in Amazon's stock price in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times sales to close out 2023, Amazon was, and still is, attractively priced.\n\nArtificial Intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.2% of holdings\n\nLoeb's substantial position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is at least partially explained by the ongoing rebound in the digital advertising market, but the company also has a sizable opportunity when it comes to AI. Loeb initiated a position in Q3 and added to it in Q4. Meta has long employed AI to serve relevant content to its social media users and to more accurately target the advertising that provides the lion's share of its revenue.\n\nMore recently, Meta has unveiled the next generation of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available for hire on all the major cloud infrastructure services. While we don't yet know the significance of its impact on Meta's bottom line, it does represent a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nWhile Loeb has been mum about his rationale, Meta meets Loeb's criteria of investing in \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations.\" And, as the sun set on 2023, Meta Platforms stock was selling for just 24 times earnings, a discount to a multiple of 26 for the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

However, Precedence Research estimates that the surgical robots industry would grow to $36 billion by 2032 from $8 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market will grow at a CAGR of 16.4% from 2023 to 2032, a nice number for ISRG investors to consider as they map the stock’s future success. ISRG itself is in a better position to exploit all this growth because of its aforementioned credibility and strong execution. The company recently announced solid Q4’23 results, surpassing Wall Street estimates consecutively for the fourth time. This was thanks to a return in the number of surgeries performed after the Covid-19 pandemic caused a delay in elective and non-urgent procedures.\n\nDue to rising obesity eligibility, Intuitive Surgical has seen potential new markets for its robotic systems in other surgeries despite a drop in bariatric surgery demand (likely caused by new weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound).\n\nIn 2024, Intuitive Surgical expects da Vinci surgical robot adoption to rise 13%–16%. Although lower than the 22% year-over-year rise in 2023, robotic-assisted surgery usage is still growing.\n\nABB (ABBNY) ABB Robotics, Inc. training center in suburban Detroit.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith over 400,000 industrial robots deployed, ABB (OTCMKTS:ABBNY) concludes our list of the top robotics stocks to purchase.\n\nAfter the Covid-19 epidemic impacted ABB’s revenue and orders, vehicle sales and industrial activity revived, preparing the business for a robust comeback. Stock rebound from epidemic lows shows investor confidence and market resiliency.\n\nCompany products are also evolving, including new GoFa cobots. ABB GoFa 10 and 12 cobots are new. Machine tending, welding and assembling are possible with these new versions’ 10 and 12 kilogram capacities and greater reaches. These cobots are safe, accurate and simple to operate, with tool center point (TCP) speeds up to two meters per second and 0.02-millimeter repeatability.\n\nABB showed its next-generation collaborative robotics for metal fabricators at FABTECH 2023. The presentation introduced precision welding and cutting cobot GoFa 12 to North America. Interactive lead-through techniques make programming simpler using the Easy Teach Device.\n\nABB’s Wizard simple programming tools and SafeMove robot safety monitoring app are available on GoFa cobots. Graphical command blocks, lead-through programming, safe speed limitations and stationary monitoring enable cobots to operate closely to people without physical safety barriers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "7 Under $50 Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "Fifty dollars doesn’t go very far today—unless you’re looking for under-$50 stocks to buy now and round out your portfolio.\n\nAlthough inflation growth may be declining, the current cost of goods and services remains significantly higher than two years ago. This discrepancy exists because inflation indexes measure ongoing growth, not actual price differences, leading to persistently low consumer confidence despite apparently positive inflation statistics.\n\nAt the same time, high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are becoming prohibitively expensive for retail traders, particularly as market volatility and general frothiness surge. This is where stocks priced under $50 come into play. They’re generally cheap enough that a decent-sized share count is easy to accumulate. At the same time, each one is positioned for rapid growth due to specific favorable conditions and bullish momentum, paving the way for potential success. Take note – these under-$50 stocks won’t stay cheap for long.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf any under-$50 stock qualifies as the comeback story of the year, it’s Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). With a solid foundation of government contracts and an expanding corporate portfolio, the artificial intelligence and machine learning company finally escaped its mid-teens rangebound trading after a strong earnings report propelled shares up by 30% since January.\n\nThat report also marked its fifth consecutive profitable quarter, recording earnings of 8 cents per share and a 14% revenue increase from government contracts at year’s end. More notably, revenue from its commercial segment jumped by 36%. While past bearish sentiment often focused on its reliance on government contracts, Palantir’s successful expansion into the corporate sector now distinguishes it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the per-share price is well under $50, the stock has remained stubbornly within the $20 – $25 range, possibly as part of CEO Alex Karp’s beef with short sellers. But despite some stock price and valuation skepticism, Palantir’s long-term prospects remain unmatched across multiple sectors, including artificial intelligence and defense industry stocks.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: GigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy. breakthrough stocks. Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has experienced a turbulent ride in 2024, initially surging to nearly $45 per share following a solid earnings report, only to fall back to pre-earnings levels – standing out as an under-$50 stock to buy now the whole time, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe decline in post-earnings share price largely reflected investors taking profits rather than a significant critique of GigaCloud’s long-term potential. Trading at just 13x earnings, GigaCloud, often compared to Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), distinguishes itself by serving B2B markets. Unlike Alibaba, GigaCloud is not just about product sourcing; it offers a comprehensive vendor management platform designed to handle cross-border payments and other complex aspects of global eCommerce that often challenge small businesses.\n\nThe small business market remains largely untapped, and GigaCloud’s solutions, including payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and warehouse storage, provide a unique value proposition. This integrated service package is particularly valuable for entrepreneurs who struggle to compete with larger entities like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As companies like Amazon continue to increase fees and fulfillment rates, SMBs looking to maintain independence will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nNews Corp (NWSA) News Corp. (NWSA_ Building front\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNews Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) may initially seem out of place among other under-$50 stocks due to its roots in legacy media—an industry not typically associated with high-flying prospects. Historically dependent on newspapers, books, and cable television, News Corp is distinguishing itself through a successful pivot to next-generation media formats.\n\nThis shift in News Corp’s strategy is partly driven by Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently snagged a significant stake in the company. Following this investment, News Corp reported a 3% increase in quarterly revenue year-over-year and a 94% boost in net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes these financial gains to the company’s strategic emphasis on digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the less predictable advertising revenue model.\n\nThis strategy mirrors that of many software-based under-$50 stocks, which favor recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For instance, News Corp is focusing on acquiring digital subscriptions rather than chasing high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) now offers Photoshop on a subscription basis rather than as a costly one-time purchase.\n\nThis strategic pivot is bearing fruit, especially in niche areas like the Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, both of which are performing strongly. Although News Corp currently places less emphasis on dividends to focus on adapting its operations for the digital era, it still offers a modest 1.65% total yield, striking a balance between operational changes and shareholder returns.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Steelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteelcase (NYSE:SCS), a high-end office furniture company, emerges as a standout under-$50 value stock that retail traders tend to skip over. The company is thriving post-pandemic as it adapts to the evolving work-from-home trends, underscored by its recent declaration of a $0.10 quarterly dividend, representing a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase has rapidly regained its financial stability after a challenging pandemic period. Its latest quarterly report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, more than doubled from last year’s figure. Furthermore, sales have maintained a steady pace of around $800 million over the past five quarters, showing that Steelcase is improving margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nIn reaction to the shifting work-from-home landscape, Steelcase is repositioning to target 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin (as a percentage of revenue) over the next five years. At the same time, the company has significantly cut its debt to better cope with the higher-rate environment, enhancing liquidity and reducing interest costs. These strategic initiatives mark Steelcase as one of the most promising stocks under-$50 stocks to buy now.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough Snap (NYSE:SNAP) contends with competitive pressures as younger users flock to newer apps, the under-$50 stock is far from defeated. Instead, it’s buoyed by its virtual and augmented reality strides and a growing advertising platform.\n\nSnap aims to surpass 475 million daily active users in 2024, setting a target above Wall Street’s expectations. The app’s appeal is further enhanced by its vast array of augmented reality lenses, created by over 350,000 AR developers and totaling nearly 3.5 million lenses.\n\nFinancially, Snap’s short-term prospects look promising, with advertising revenue expected to grow by more than 20% in 2024, surpassing Wall Street’s forecast of 14% and aligning with Snap’s ambitious goals. For the upcoming quarter, Snap anticipates revenue between $1,095 million and $1,135 million, marking a year-over-year increase of 11% to 15%. These positive indicators position Snap as a compelling choice among under-$50 stocks, especially for those bullish on long-term augmented reality trends.\n\nUnder-$50 Stocks to Buy Now: Braze, Inc. (BRZE) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nAdvertising technology is undergoing a quiet renaissance as digital consumer trends evolve and media becomes more centered around content creators. Venture capital is pouring into private AdTech firms, yet publicly traded Braze, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRZE) stands out as an under-$50 stock ideally positioned to capitalize on these emerging marketing trends. Braze enables brands to manage multichannel marketing across all major digital platforms, adopting a fresh and unique approach.\n\nUnlike traditional AdTech companies that target consumer segments through aggressive campaigns, Braze excels in navigating consumer engagement practices. It manages curated journeys that follow users across platforms and deliver a personalized and unique experience. This personalization fosters a mental connection between the user and the brand, effectively converting potential customers. This effective strategy is why well-known entities like Match (NASDAQ:MTCH), NASCAR, and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) flock to Braze’s distinctive services.\n\nAlthough Braze is not yet profitable and trades at a premium today, despite its under-$50 pricing, the company is a pioneer in emerging advertising trends. Early entrants in such dynamic sectors often require time to build momentum and achieve profitability, so get in on the ground floor before it’s too late.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs startups and established companies increasingly harness GPT-derived “innovations,” Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) emerges as a robust EdTech contender, using artificial intelligence to transform traditional learning institutions and concepts. Although its shares currently trade nearly one-third lower than their January pricing, Chegg’s solid fourth-quarter report has led to a new wave of analyst upgrades in anticipation of the first-quarter report due on April 29th.\n\nThe company already boasts a solid gross margin of 68%, with management predicting even higher margins for 2024 despite a slight dip in revenue and subscription rates in 2023. These forecasts come as the company invests heavily in R&D and related costs to develop new AI offerings and tailor them to evolving trends and technologies.\n\nCEO Dan Rosensweig has acknowledged the challenging balancing act, stating that the team “completely reinvented the company by leveraging the advancements in artificial intelligence” and that, as the initial AI hype wanes, “leaders in their verticals like Chegg are taking control of their own destiny by building their own models [that offer] higher quality and lower cost.” Chegg is finding its footing within the AI-enabled EdTech landscape. As more individuals and institutions adopt forward-looking technologies, this under-$50 stock is poised to potentially surge significantly in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off.\n\n“We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.”\n\nBut generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nMeta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter.\n\nStrap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks.\n\nGenerative AI takes center stage again\n\nThe generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. Microsoft will report earnings on April 25 as investors wait to learn more about how the company is monetizing its AI strategy. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n“We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year-to-date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That’s sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nBut the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform.\n\n“You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia will relinquish its lead in the market anytime soon. It’s still miles ahead of rivals AMD and Intel in terms of market share, and it just debuted its Blackwell architecture during its GTC developer conference in March, which should put it even further ahead. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about processing units during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., on March 18. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“They still have a commanding lead and share, and their influence is huge, and they are not slowing down, to their credit,” O’Donnell said. “But the law of big numbers starts to kick in at a certain point.”\n\nThen there are the hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google. While they’ve been riding the AI hype train, many of their generative AI software offerings are still in the works, meaning it’s a bit early to get a full read on overall uptake among enterprise and consumer customers. Still, Wall Street will likely be looking for at least some revenue growth from the companies’ AI investments.\n\n“How much is AI driving [Microsoft’s] Azure? How much is AI driving Google Cloud growth? How much is it continuing to help AWS which has sort of seen its numbers slow,” said Newman.\n\nIn its last quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to its Azure revenue, up from 3 percentage points in the prior quarter. And you can bet analysts will be looking to see if the company can keep that kind of growth up in the current quarter.\n\nAmazon also pointed to AI as a growth catalyst during its last earnings call, saying revenue was \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers showed interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see if the company provides any more context around that acceleration in its upcoming earnings call. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O annual developer conference at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, Calif., on May 10, 2023. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle, like Microsoft, will also likely face questions about sales of its AI-enhanced productivity suite and how customers are responding. The company, which will host its I/O developer conference in May, has also faced controversy over its AI rollout, pulling back its Gemini AI generator after it generated historically inaccurate images.\n\nApple on deck\n\nApple’s earnings will also be a hot ticket but don’t expect the company to reveal anything about its future generative AI plans.\n\n“Apple needs to disclose something, but the company has never really been in a hurry to pacify industry investors,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think they're going to wait until WWDC in a couple of months to bring that out.”\n\nOutside of AI, investors are eagerly anticipating Apple’s iPhone revenue numbers and commentary on its lawsuits. On Monday, market intelligence firm IDC reported that global iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the current quarter. That could have a significant impact on Apple’s overall revenue.\n\nSales in China are also a problem for the company. Apple reported revenue in its third-largest market declined 13% in the prior quarter. That, coupled with falling iPhone shipments, could spell trouble for the company’s earnings.\n\nDespite those headwinds, however, there could be a bright spot. According to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple should report double-digit growth in its Services segment, which could help buoy overall sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe company’s upcoming earrings will also give investors their first glimpse into Vision Pro sales, which should offer some insight into early consumer and enterprise interest in the AR/VR headset.\n\nDigital advertising sales on the rise\n\nMeta and Google will also be on deck to show whether they can keep up the momentum in the digital advertising market. In the prior quarter, Meta’s ad sales jumped 24%, while Google’s ad sales, including YouTube ads, increased 11%.\n\nAmazon, which has built its own impressive advertising business, could also see continued ad sales growth. In the prior quarter, the company reported advertising revenue of $14.7 billion, up 27% year over year. Another performance like that could provide a nice boost to the company’s bottom line.\n\nAnalysts will also be on the lookout to see if AI is impacting advertising sales.\n\n“Theoretically, targeting should be better by using AI even with the deprecation of the cookie, but we haven't seen that yet,” Moorhead said. “To me, the evidence that I would have to see is a higher cost per click or a better CPM.”\n\nWe’ll find out all of that and more when Big Tech earnings kick off next week.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Retail Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "If 2024 is any indication, those interested in retail stocks should look to the VanEck Retail ETF (NASDAQ:RTH) for inspiration rather than the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT).\n\nThe former tracks the performance of the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index, while the latter follows the S&P Retail Select Industry Index. The two ETFs own 25 and 79 retail stocks, respectively.\n\nHow have they done so far in 2024? RTH is up nearly 9% year to date, almost 5x the performance of XRT, and 17 basis points up on the S&P 500. RTH has beaten them over the past five years, up more than 91%, 20% higher than the index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRTH’s secret sauce is investing in 25 of America’s largest retailers. This is comforting at a time when many retailers aren’t experiencing growth due to higher prices and interest rates.\n\nI’ve taken the holdings from RTH and selected three that 60% of analysts rate as a buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is RTH’s top holding, accounting for 21.55% of its $210.1 million in net assets. Sixty-two analysts cover its stock, with 95% rating AMZN stock as a buy. It’s in a league of its own with analysts for many reasons.\n\nBetween AI, the cloud, Prime memberships and advertising revenues, Amazon has a plethora of revenue streams to draw from at any point in the economic cycle. That makes it almost recession-proof.\n\nTo continue generating significant profits, the company hasn’t been timid about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of employees from its AWS cloud business in 2024. According to comments from an AWS spokesperson in early April, Quartz reports:\n\n“We’ve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact.”\n\nOver the past two years, it has cut over 30,000 jobs from its headcount. While that seems like a lot, at the end of December 2023, it amounted to less than 2% of its workforce .\n\nProfits are back in a big way and rapidly growing despite Amazon’s significant investment ($4 billion in Anthropic alone) in AI.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is RTH’s fourth-largest holding, accounting for 7.24% of its $210.1 million in net assets. Thirty-nine analysts cover its stock, with an 85% rating of WMT stock as a buy.\n\nWalmart has had a solid year in the markets, up more than 13% YTD and 78% over the past five years. It used to be an excellent defensive stock to own, but in the past two years, it’s gone on the offensive to capture market share and grow its top and bottom lines.\n\nStory continues\n\nI can’t remember the last time Walmart did a stock split. Yet, on Feb. 26, it issued three new shares for every one held by shareholders. Not surprisingly, large companies whose stocks are appreciating can become too expensive for their own employees to buy, so cutting the share price by two-thirds will encourage greater uptake.\n\nStatistics show that moves like these generally don’t make much of a difference. Furthermore, with share fractionalization, employees can buy Walmart stock with relative ease. On the plus side, however, stock splits indicate a high level of confidence from management.\n\nDue to its value proposition, the discount retailer attracts customers from every income demographic. I expect that analysts will continue to favor WMT stock, as it’s a long-term buy.\n\nLululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is the 14th-largest holding of RTH, accounting for 2.42% of its $210.1 million net assets. Thirty-five analysts cover its stock, 71% rating LULU stock as a buy.\n\nIn recent weeks, the lifestyle apparel and footwear brand’s management has been far more cautious about its business than in the past. This has put a cloud over its share price, which is down more than 31% in 2024. It now trades at its lowest point since March 2023.\n\nI suggest buying a little now and waiting a couple of quarters to see how this recent weakness plays out. One could also purchase some put options to protect their downside. I’d back up the truck if it falls below $300 in 2024.\n\nAs they say, insiders sell for various reasons; they buy for only one.\n\nBarron’s reported on April 5 that Lululemon chair Marti Morfitt bought 3,200 shares of LULU stock between March 26 and 27 at an average price of $389.06. Since then, the shares have been down nearly 10%. This was Morfitt’s first buy on the open market since June 2021.\n\nWith LULU expected to generate at least $10.7 billion in 2024 revenue and analysts calling for $14.17 a share in earnings and $15.87 in 2025, it trades at just 22 times its 2025 earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks the Hedge Fund Gurus Are Piling Into: April 2024",
        "content": "With a lot of uncertainty in the market from geopolitics down to monetary policy, jittery investors may find comfort in hedge fund picks. Specifically, ideas that the alpha wolves of the market have put their money into may offer both confidence and upside.\n\nWhen I think about this theme, I can’t help but recall the film “Wall Street” (the original one). The antihero of the movie, Gordon Gekko, remarks that he hates losses. Instead, he prefers sure things, which eventually moves the narrative forward (I won’t give it away). And that’s why hedge fund picks are intriguing – these institutions hate losses.\n\nOf course, the risk factor is that these entities can often absorb the consequences of their mistakes. You, on the other hand, might not be able to. So, take these ideas with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for high-success-probability ideas, the below hedge fund picks may be a good place to start.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoftware and technology hardware giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have a reputation for being boring. However, boring appears to be gold in this environment. According to HedgeFollow, major institutions have acquired $40.83 billion worth of MSFT stock based on 13F filings in the fourth quarter of last year. The biggest player is Vanguard Group, which acquired $5.43 billion worth of shares.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why the big dogs appreciate Microsoft – it’s consistent. In the last fiscal year, the company’s positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%. Its best performance in 2023 was in the third quarter, posting earnings per share of $2.73. This print beat out the estimate of earnings of $2.42 per share.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $11.64. That’s well above last year’s result of $9.81 EPS. Further, revenue may clock in at $244.22 billion, 15.2% above last year’s tally of $211.91 billion. With its investments in artificial intelligence, Microsoft could easily reach these targets. It’s one of the hedge fund picks to consider.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be a predictable idea among hedge fund picks, it’s also a compelling one. Fundamentally, e-commerce transactions as a share of total retail sales continue to rise since Q2 2022. That’s encouraging for AMZN stock amid all the inflation concerns. Not surprisingly, then, the major institutions have picked up on this development, buying up $24.1 billion worth of AMZN shares in Q4.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft above, investors appreciate Amazon for its consistency. What makes the company stand out, though, is the high baseline. It’s not just that Amazon beat its bottom-line targets last year. Rather, the average positive earnings surprise landed at 55.15%. That’s extremely impressive, even for a hot tech player.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS of $4.13. That’s well above last year’s tally of $2.90. Further, they’re looking for revenue to hit $641.35 billion or 11.6% up from 2023’s result of $574.78 billion. Combined with a unanimous strong buy rating (among 41 expert voices), AMZN is one of the hedge fund picks to add to your portfolio.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it might not get the spotlight like some other tech players, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is vital to the overall ecosystem. As a designer, developer and supplier of various semiconductor devices, it plays an indispensable role in the innovation industry. Therefore, it’s not surprising that it’s one of the favorites among hedge fund picks. In the final quarter of 2023, major entities bought just over $16 billion worth of AVGO stock.\n\nAs with the other ideas on this list, Broadcom benefits from consistency. In fiscal 2023, the company beat all its bottom-line targets. Its average positive earnings surprise came out to a decent 2.8%. Its best performance last year came in Q4, when it delivered EPS of $10.99. In contrast, experts were anticipating EPS of $10.29.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts believe Broadcom will post earnings of $46.91 per share. That’s a significant boost from last year’s result of $42.25 EPS. Not only that, the average revenue target stands at $50.35 billion, up 40.6% from last year’s haul of $35.82 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAs an internet technology giant among other specialties, it’s no surprise that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks highly among hedge fund picks. You really can’t do much these days without Alphabet’s myriad services. For example, even if you don’t use the company’s Gmail system, you’re more than likely using Google to conduct searches. With that, hedge funds have put in $14.81 billion in GOOGL stock in Q4 last year.\n\nThis figure should only rise in the years ahead. As a well-established business, Alphabet probably isn’t going to make prospective investors rich. However, it should be a stable anchor during rough waters. Last year, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in Q1, producing a positive surprise of 9.3%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are hoping for the tech firm to post EPS of $6.82. That’s a big boost from $5.80, though it seems reasonable given the historical performance. Also, revenue could soar to $342.35 billion, up 11.4% from last year. Combined with a strong buy consensus view, GOOGL is one of the top hedge fund picks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting life as a social media network called Facebook – you may have heard of it – Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has branched out into other avenues. Right now, it’s focused on the metaverse, which represents the next wave of connectivity. While many experts have questions about this directive, Meta’s sales of related hardware – such virtual reality headsets – offer upside potential.\n\nAs such, the big dogs have invested $14.08 billion into META stock in the final quarter of 2023. With the company announcing a dividend, it could attract more institutional players. Financially, the benefit of owning META comes down to robust performances. Last year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 10%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $20.03. That’s a huge jump from last year’s print of earnings of $14.87 per share. Also, experts believe Meta will keep on expanding, delivering sales of $158.39 billion. That’s up 17.4% from the prior year. With so many positives, META ranks as one of the top-tier hedge fund picks.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA simultaneously risky but compelling idea, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) shows that the big dogs like to speculate at times too. What makes UBER a tough idea for hedge fund picks is the question mark hanging over discretionary consumer sentiment. People are looking to save money during this juncture, especially with inflation possibly about to worsen.\n\nOn the other hand, UBER makes for an intriguing idea because of its travel implications. According to Deloitte, the phenomenon known as revenge traveling might have come to an end. Nevertheless, people are still prioritizing destinations and experiences. If that continues to hold, Uber could be an enticing speculative bet. Sure enough, institutional investors bought up $10.84 billion worth of UBER stock.\n\nNotably, the experts are excited about the ride-sharing specialist too. For the current fiscal year, they’re projecting EPS to land at $1.36. That’s noticeably above last year’s print of 87 cents. Also, revenue could clock in at $43.32 billion, up 16.2% from 2023. Even better, fiscal 2025 sales could hit $50.42 billion.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt this moment, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) may be an investment that sells itself. Yes, the geopolitical backdrop presents volatility risks for all sectors, including the crude oil space. However, the world continues to run on oil. So, if global tensions – already simmering from recent actions – spiral out of control, supply chains could be disrupted.\n\nCynically, this dynamic could be a positive for XOM in terms of sales and profits. Even if blistering costs hurt the wallet, economies just can’t stop moving altogether. And because hydrocarbons represent a critical commodity, both people and institutions will find a way to pay. With that in mind, it’s not shocking that hedge funds acquired $9.42 billion worth of XOM stock.\n\nWith the recent market dip, the institutional players could acquire even more shares. To be sure, the average consensus view of $9.27 EPS on sales of $334.88 billion imply a top-and-bottom-line decrease from last year’s results. Still, given the latest reality, the high-side estimate of $11.08 EPS on sales of $384.24 billion could be in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Amazon removed Just Walk Out from many of its own stores but wants to sell the system to others",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon wants the public and - especially other businesses - to know it’s not giving up on its Just Walk Out technology.\n\nAlthough the company is ditching the cashier-less checkout system at its Amazon Fresh grocery stores, it plans to sell the technology to more than 120 third-party businesses by the end of the year. Reaching that goal would double the number of non-Amazon enterprises that use Just Walk Out compared to last year.\n\n“For us, really making sure that we can service that third-party market is the most important thing,” Jon Jenkins, the vice president of Just Walk Out at Amazon, said in an interview. “We’ve definitely been reassuring people that we are in this for the long haul.\"\n\nJust Walk Out uses cameras, artificial intelligence and sensor trackers to determine what’s taken off of shelves, enabling customers to grab what they want and leave if they insert a credit card or another payment method at a store’s entry gate.\n\nThe retailer first began offering the technology to other businesses – such as sports stadiums - in 2020, two years after it started using it at Amazon Go convenience stores. Those stores and some Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K. will continue to offer Just Walk Out. But the technology will be replaced with smart carts at Fresh stores in the U.S., Amazon announced this month.\n\nSmart carts, which are already available in some Amazon Fresh locations, use sensors to identify items placed inside and have screens that allow customers to see nearby deals as well as how much their groceries will cost. Customers can skip the checkout line by scanning and tallying up items on its cameras.\n\nThe change comes as Amazon is working to revamp its Fresh stores with a mix of technology and traditional grocery offerings that will help it attract more customers. The company's grocery store brands include Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, as well as supermarket chain Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\n\nBut Amazon's efforts to become a giant in the U.S. grocery market hasn’t been easy. Early last year, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that the company was working to find the formula that would allow it to make a larger impact in brick-and-mortar grocery stores.\n\nJenkins argued that removing Just Walk Out from U.S. Amazon Fresh stores did not reflect a miscalculation by the company. Instead, he described the decision as an outgrowth of an experimentation process to figure out what does and doesn’t work for shoppers.\n\n“What we found is customers in big grocery stores want a shopping assistant to travel along with them,” he said. Meanwhile, “shoppers in smaller store formats tend to be very mission driven. They want to get in and out quickly, with as little friction as possible.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAbandoning the technology in many of its own stores could make it challenging for Amazon to sell Just Walk Out to other businesses. But some experts think the move also could expand adoption among smaller-format stores and locations akin to Amazon Go stores.\n\nJohn Clear, a senior director at the professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal, says he believes cashier-less technology is going to become more common in grab-and-go shopping areas where human interaction tends to be limited, labor is hard to come by and businesses are almost always attempting to cut down on costs.\n\n“We’re seeing a natural evolution of the technology, kind of expanding where it’s working\" and drawing back where it's not, Clear said.\n\nIn its attempt to sell its technology to other businesses, Amazon is also trying to counter some recent viral social media posts that claimed the checkout system was not a technological marvel but was instead powered by contractors in India who manually added up items in carts as customers shopped.\n\nBusiness publication The Information and news website Vox reported in the past that Amazon used human reviewers for the technology, which the company has acknowledged. Jenkins said the company hires associates who take some video clips and label them so they can be used to train the machine learning system.\n\nBut the notion “people in India are watching you shop live in a store and figuring out what you bought is completely inaccurate,” he said.\n\nIn some cases, when the system was not able to figure out what happened in a store, a human watches a snippet of video to make sure the receipt a customer received was accurate, Jenkins added. Such reviews happen in a “small minority” of cases, he said, declining to give an estimate.\n\nJenkins also declined to share how many people the company has hired to review and label videos. However, he said it was less than the 1,000 figure cited in media reports.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Opinion: These Will Be the 4 Largest Companies by 2035",
        "content": "Just 11 years ago, Apple, ExxonMobil, Alphabet, and Berkshire Hathaway were the four largest American companies. Today, only two of those companies -- Apple and Alphabet -- remain in the top four. Berkshire Hathaway has slipped to No. 7, and ExxonMobil and Walmart have fallen from the top 10 altogether.\n\nA lot can change in only 11 years. Let's look at the companies I believe will claim the top four spots in 2035. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nBy 2035, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will be the world's largest company by market cap. What's more, I think it could happen even sooner.\n\nOne reason is that Nvidia has already grown faster than nearly anyone expected. The company's market cap has exploded almost 10x, from $0.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion in less than two years. NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nThe massive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is behind the company's rapid rise. Thanks to its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia is well-positioned to take the crown as the largest company by 2035 -- if not sooner. That's because the GPU market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. According to Global Markets Insights, the size of the GPU market is set to expand from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2032.\n\nWhat's more, the ramp in GPU spending is already here. Nvidia's sales increased by a mind-blowing 265% year over year in its most recent quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28, 2024). While sales are expected to cool somewhat, analysts still expect the company to grow them by 82% this year.\n\nOver the next five years, given the explosive growth of the overall GPU market, analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 37% per year, meaning the company's annual revenue by 2030 could approach $300 billion.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is riding a tsunami of growth that could carry it all the way to the top spot by 2035.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.2 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's largest company, having passed Apple last year.\n\nLike Nvidia, the AI revolution has lifted Microsoft's market cap significantly. The company's extensive and iconic software suite offers a natural home for AI-powered tools, and it has wasted no time integrating AI features into its software.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft enjoys a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That partnership has already helped both companies and puts Microsoft in a good spot to benefit from future AI breakthroughs that OpenAI may make. AI will likely be the key factor in driving market caps higher over the next decade, and Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of growth, analysts expect Microsoft to grow sales by 16% per year over the next five years, implying annual sales of over $475 billion by 2030. That's nearly in line with an internal target set by chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella of $500 billion in revenue by 2030. Either way, Microsoft's expected growth shows that the company has staying power, and while the company may not be able to stay ahead of Nvidia, it will likely keep its lead over everyone else.\n\nAmazon\n\nWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is currently America's fifth-largest company. But by 2035, I see it leapfrogging a number of companies, including Apple and Alphabet, to take the third spot.\n\nThat's because Amazon, like Nvidia and Microsoft before it, has a natural way to benefit from the AI revolution. The company already utilizes more than 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouses. They measure and pack products, move heavy items, read labels, and distribute shelves and packages.\n\nIn addition, AI should help the company improve the digital side of its e-commerce business. AI assistants can shop for customers and help with returns. AI-powered ad tools can refine which customers see which ads, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and generating more ad revenue for Amazon. Moreover, the company's crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), should continue to benefit from the transition to the cloud over the next decade.\n\nAmazon is already one of the largest companies by revenue; the company has generated $575 billion over the last 12 months -- second only to Walmart's $648 billion. However, Amazon is closing the gap quickly and should overtake Walmart soon. Analysts expect Amazon to grow its revenue by 31% per year over the next five years, bringing annual revenue to an eye-popping $2.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nThanks to its impressive revenue growth, I think Amazon will climb the rankings up to third place.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nRounding out the top four is MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META). Currently the sixth-largest American company by market cap, I expect Meta to leapfrog both Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nMeta is quickly becoming one of the world's biggest cash cows. The company's lucrative ad business continues to grow by leaps and bounds as the digital advertising market expands. Moreover, Meta's ambitious AI research and development could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs over the next decade.\n\nIn terms of revenue, analysts expect Meta to grow revenue by 26% annually over the next five years, leading to an annual total of $429 billion by 2030.\n\nAt any rate, with its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) providing ample free cash flow, Meta is well-positioned to grow its market cap significantly over the next decade, so it could surpass laggards like Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon’s co-inventor of ‘Just Walk Out’ tech—which is being removed from U.S. grocery stores—sets the record straight on the ‘overblown’ theory of its demise",
        "content": "Amazon said earlier this month that it was removing its “Just Walk Out” cashierless technology from the 28 Amazon Fresh and two Whole Foods grocery stores in the U.S. that used the system. The news triggered a cascade of headlines declaring the demise of the technology, one of Amazon’s boldest bets to reinvent the way consumers buy products at brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe reality is a bit more complicated. Amazon is not abandoning Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the company says it’s expanding the number of places where it’s available—it’s just focusing on different kinds of venues like airports and sports stadiums. And in grocery stores, Amazon is replacing Just Walk Out technology with fleets of tech-enabled “Dash” shopping carts that include item scanners, touch screens that display nearby items, and automatic billing that also allows for skipping the checkout line.\n\nStill, the fact that Amazon is rolling back Just Walk Out technology in its U.S. grocery stores (U.K. grocery stores will continue to use the technology as of now) is clearly a black eye for Amazon and a setback to its ambitions. Just Walk Out technology was at the heart of the company’s plan to expand into the physical shopping realm by becoming a transformational leader in the business, not just another player.\n\nTo better understand what the grocery store pullback means for the future of Just Walk Out technology, and how it affects Amazon’s overall physical store strategy, Fortune sat down with Dilip Kumar, an Amazon VP who was one of the inventors of Amazon’s cashierless technology. Kumar, a former “shadow”—or chief of staff—to Jeff Bezos, described the company’s current strategy, and also set the record straight about how much humans are really involved behind the scenes to make Just Walk Out technology work.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFortune: So what’s really going on with your investment in Just Walk Out technology?\n\nKumar: This theory of the demise of Just Walk Out is a little overblown. We’re actually doubling down on all the areas where I think it really resonates.\n\nAnd so what we’re seeing in third-party, small-format stores is that anywhere where there are throughput constraints, wherever people are time-constrained—like stadiums, airports, convention centers, universities, in hospitals—it really is resonating. [Amazon has sold the technology to around 140 third-party convenience stores and concession stands worldwide.]\n\nWe’re going to be doubling the number of stores this year. I feel like when you tell [businesses] about Just Walk Out it feels like a leap of faith for people to hear, “Rip out your point-of-sale system and [use] this completely different customer experience, and trust us, it’s going to work.” And so people start with one store or two, and then they come back and they see that it’s doubling or tripling their sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike at [Seattle’s] Lumen Field. They started with two stores, and now they have nine. In [Chicago’s] United Center, they started with two stores, and now they have seven. Hudson [airport convenience stores] started with a store, and now they have more than a dozen.\n\nAnd so I think one of the things that they’re seeing is, it is the single best thing that they can do that doubles, triples their throughput and the number of transactions. But they also find that it is not cannibalistic even if you put multiple locations in the same [building].\n\nWhy wasn’t the technology a fit for the larger Amazon Fresh stores?\n\nWhen you think about your grocery trip, it’s not just time that is important. What people also want is the notion of how much are they spending? Where are the items located? Can I get this real-time receipt or tally of knowing exactly what’s going into my cart? Are my coupons being applied? These are a bunch of other things that also become just as important.\n\nAnd by the way, a lot of these things increase in importance as the size of your trip increases. So as the total amount of dollars that you’re spending increases, as the total amount of time that you’re spending increases, all of these other elements also become important. And for those reasons, we felt like the Dash Cart is a much better platform for experimentation and continued invention in large-format grocery stores rather than Just Walk Out.\n\nIs that your decision? Or is that [Amazon grocery store SVP] Tony Hoggett’s decision?\n\nIt was Tony and I. [His team] is in the process of changing how the Amazon Fresh stores are getting designed. They’re sort of moving things around. They’re sort of saying, “We need certain things in a certain way.” And when you try to do two things [simultaneously] that are constantly evolving, it actually slows a bunch of things down.\n\nThe cart still allows you to be able to skip the line, but it also has a bunch of these other benefits that are important while you are shopping that customers were telling us about.\n\nIt also allows the store to be able to make changes with the level that they needed to. [An Amazon spokesman later clarified that the changes to Amazon Fresh stores include adjustments to store layouts and product selection that would require significant retraining of the Just Walk Out technology, but less so for Dash Cart.]\n\nSo for a variety of reasons, it was the right decision for large-format stores.\n\nI was still a little surprised by this. I understand all the things you’re telling me that customers have told you, but how much of a factor was the cost differential between the carts and the Just Walk Out system?\n\nThe carts are always going to be lower cost than any Just Walk Out system … because one scales with the number of shoppers and the other scales based on the square footage that it has to cover.\n\nBut … we felt like there’s a lot of information that happens during the trip, which is relevant, that the carts can provide. With the carts, there’s a little bit more of a human interaction [necessary], but one of the things that we see is that the cart will eventually get to the place … to being no different than just picking up a traditional cart. Plus there is the augmentation of a bunch of things that are relevant while the person is in the store shopping [compared] to the current Just Walk out experience, where it is completely devoid of any feedback, or any helpful information, until you get [the receipt].\n\nI’m sure you’ve seen the test run that GeekWire reporters went through and some of the complaints about the Dash Cart experience, or just things that didn’t go as smoothly as planned. Do you think that’s sort of normal with where you’re at with the cart experience?\n\nI think their experiences are not what we see from the vast majority of the customer satisfaction scores that we get. We have a 98% customer satisfaction score for our Dash Carts and 80% of Dash Cart shoppers are repeat shoppers.\n\nHaving said that, it’s always useful to acknowledge what folks went through in their experience, things that we could do better. There’s a bunch of things in the works which will continue to make that experience more and more intuitive for shoppers. Today we require people to use an app to be able to use the cart. But, you know, when Amazon Go started, the only way to enter the store was using an app and a QR code in the app. But since then we said you can use Amazon One [palm scanning], you can use a credit card to enter, you can even use your badge.\n\nA lot of those kinds of things will happen to the cart as well. A lot of the things like, how intuitive is it, how easy is it to add or remove products. There’ll be plenty of improvements made in that dimension, which I’m already seeing in the next generation. So I’m reasonably confident that we will get closer and closer to the experience where people find these to be invaluable. We’re already seeing that for the subset of customers who use it. But it will become more ubiquitous. Amazon Fresh is going to [continue] rolling these out; we’re going to be launching these with several third-party grocers as well. So we’re getting good feedback from folks, but also things that we know that we have to get better at and make intuitive for the first-time user.\n\nObviously a big storyline that got distorted over the past couple of weeks was about the team behind the scenes helping to ensure accuracy and also to help train the Just Walk Out technology through labeling and other means. Years ago, I reported before your first Amazon Go store opened to the public that there were some humans working behind the scenes. Can you just clarify what is and isn’t happening with this staff now?\n\nHumans built this technology. Humans also annotate and label some of these [videos of customers shopping] in order for our algorithms to be able to learn and get trained. We are also generating a lot of synthetic data to train our algorithms. So the combination of this has always been consistent.\n\nThere were several articles about “Oh, people are actually watching these videos in real time.” It was just sort of beyond ludicrous. But it’s also a good point to be able to clarify for folks who are not as involved in this technology and don’t realize how some of these things work.\n\nWhat humans actually are doing behind the scenes is very useful. All of these algorithms need a little bit of training data in order to be able to generalize. And so when we’re thinking about this, staff are annotating videos, or different video frames, or figuring out who took what, and that requires a series of annotations. And so the humans are actually helping with that aspect of it.\n\nSo that’s one thing they are doing.\n\nBut one of the other things is that the system that is generating the output can’t audit itself. So humans actually sample a small sample of videos, in order to ascertain the accuracy [before Amazon provides a Just Walk Out customer with a receipt].\n\nMachine learning algorithms work on confidence boundaries, like, “How confident are you that something happened?” And so as the confidence gets lower and lower to a certain threshold, if it’s below, maybe somebody should verify it. But even the things that are really close to that threshold, those are the ones that we would subsample. And we would say, “What made us get so close? What would make it more confident? What would make us way more confident that X took Y product or this happened?”\n\nThose particular sessions are the kinds of things that humans are annotating. It is a very small percentage of these videos that humans actually review as part of the receipt [process]. The vast majority [of receipts] go in on an automated basis.\n\nSo are you willing to share what percentage of receipts need to be reviewed?\n\nWe don’t share those numbers. It’s a small portion of the overall number of transactions that get reviewed by humans as a percentage of receipts.\n\nThere was a report that in 2022 humans were involved in 700 of every 1,000 Just Walk Out sessions. Is that true?\n\nIn the earlier days when we were creating the large format stores, we tagged and annotated a significant portion of those initial transactions, because it was super important for us to be able to build the algorithms necessary for that. So yes, we did it.\n\nBut it wasn’t in real time; it wasn’t while the receipt was being generated. What we wanted to do is to be able to tag as many of those sessions as possible. We would tag a lot of sessions, we would then run our algorithms, and then know where there were gaps … refine it to the next set of things that we didn’t have enough information on … and lather, rinse, repeat. So yes, we tagged different types of transactions in different quantities, in order to be able to make sure that our algorithms could generalize.\n\nBut like 700 out of 1,000 for receipts? No. It was probably a combination. I don’t know if it was 700, that sounds high, but we tagged a sufficient amount.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AMD's Cost-Effective Strategy Is Intelligent, but the Valuation Is Troubling",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the world's favorite artificial intelligence investments currently. I believe its position in the market is very clever, as it focuses on appealing to cost-conscious buyers still looking for advanced computation capabilities. However, I think we should remember that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) by far offers the most expansive ecosystem for AI, and it is developing this into something truly special. AMD can compete in the portion of the market it is targeting, but the long-term prospects for the stock remain speculative given the present valuation multiples.\n\nOperations analysis\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nAMD is one of the most compelling companies working in AI chip development, but its most significant, and certainly stronger, competitor is Nvidia. For quite some time, I have been concerned about whether the valuation of the stock is too risky, and it is fair to say the investment comes with potential valuation drawbacks, even though the company's future growth looks good. I do believe the market has slightly gotten ahead of itself here with too much enthusiasm, and a correction could occur. But it must be said that AMD is firing on all cylinders as it relates to becoming even more significant in AI and, as such, I can see why the market has placed such a premium on the shares. One has to question, though, whether this premium is market enthusiasm or wider speculation from non-professional investors who are not tuned in enough to the fundamentals and instead just want to invest in AI.\n\nThe company is not just a powerhouse in advanced chips, where its production of central processing units and graphics processing units are key to operating AI technologies. It also offers a range of products and services for high-level computers. It is becoming apparent that it may be able to offer some competitive advantage over Nvidia in certain areas. While Nvidia is focused long term on the full-stack market for AI, similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, but specializing in AI services, AMD is focused on selling elite capabilities of compute at good value for money. The company is focusing on performance per dollar and innovative technologies at accessible prices, but the market notices this is an exceptional strategy. Unfortunately, it perhaps leaves little room for outside investors to reap the benefits at this time without taking on excess valuation risk because of how widely spread it is being accepted that AMD's strategy is onto something vital.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer analysis\n\nMy research has shown me that Nvidia's current position in the market is undoubtedly the strongest. In second place behind it, I believe, is AMD. But also important are Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) in GPUs, ARM, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in CPUs and servers and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Samsung (SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in custom semiconductor solutions. It is quite clear that the clever and best companies involved in technology software and hardware want to flesh out their own AI divisions, but there still comes the point where some outsourcing is necessary for top-level results. Apple produces its own chips now, which is its role in custom solutions, but other computer manufacturers who do not have the same trillion-dollar-plus market cap are going to be looking to Nvidia, AMD, Intel and others to provide the chips to fuel the demand for ever-increasing power in laptops, desktops and intelligent devices.\n\nAs smaller hardware companies seek to join the ranks of companies who offer AI integrated with devices, I believe AMD has the strongest competitive positioning if it continues to hone in on cost-effective advanced CPUs and GPUs. By doing so, it caters to a critical part of the market that other providers would be less focused on as they serve the larger, full-stack needs of conglomerates, big data companies and those working with highly advanced technology like robotics.\n\nHowever, suppose AMD fails to flesh out its AI ecosystem effectively. In that case, it might lose out in its current target market to Nvidia more than investors are currently pricing into the stock. What customers are going to want is ease of access to advanced AI tasks. Beyond pure compute provision, a unified platform to manage AI workloads that Nivida is aiming for with its full-stack approach may be much more compelling in the long run as AI tasks become more complex and demand for advanced capabilities scales. This should apply even to smaller companies that can afford it. While AMD has partnerships to help in this regard, its profitability will suffer if it does not provide the core foundation for the demanded capabilities.\n\nOn that note, I am particularly keen on AMD's balance sheet, which shows an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.82. In comparison, Nvidia's ratio is 0.65, while Broadcom's is just 0.40. I believe AMD's strength in its balance sheet will serve it well with any needs that may arise where it needs to invest more heavily in full-stack solutions. The company can notably take on more debt without too much damage to its financial agility or sense of security for shareholders.\n\nValuation\n\nFirst, consider the following chart, which presents the main valuation multiples of what I consider to be some of the most competitive peers to AMD:\n\nAMD Nvidia Intel Broadcom ARM P/E Ratio Without NRI 116 71.6 35.8 32.4 165.6 P/S Ratio 12 35.6 2.9 15 44.6 P/FCF Ratio 241.8 80.4 NM 31.5 171.9\n\nFrom the above chart, it is quite clear that AMD sells at a very high multiples, but we can also see its multiples are not uncommon in its industry for the major players, other than its free cash flow ratio, which is the highest of all the five peers listed. I believe there is some truth to the statement that AMD is investing heavily in future growth, so it is taking a profitability hit in the near term in exchange for long-term gains. I do believe AMD will stabilize its profitability in due course, and then its price-earnings multiples will become much more tolerable. But as we can see, its revenue growth has shown to be very promising, which is indicated in the lower price-sales ratio against Nvidia, ARM Holdings and Broadcom.\n\nIn my opinion, the valuation for AMD is not intolerable, but it certainly exposes investors to a lot of risks if it struggles in achieving expectations or if it struggles to manifest long-term profitability at a scale that investors are currently anticipating. It has proven it can generate rapid and lasting revenue growth, and I am certain in time, it will translate this into a stronger bottom line, but there is also the consideration of growing expenditures to remain competitive, especially as it relates to my comments about it not having a full-stack ecosystem, which it may decide it needs to develop, albeit at a smaller scale to Nvidia, to remain relevant. Therefore, I can see some long-term risk here which could cause present enthusiasm to deflate, and I think investors who bought in at present prices run the risk of losing a significant amount of capital if adverse conditions arise.\n\nPutting the AI market valuation risks into perspective\n\nI view AMD very favorably, so I think the market has priced the shares high for a reason. Based on my research of the industry, I have come to believe the present AI enthusiasm is not a bubble like during the internet boom of the 1990s. Instead, the results of this technological shift look to be much more profound and lasting, but the potential for speculative behavior still remains. While in the 1990s, many companies went to zero, in this period, I believe the potential for speculation simply means more likelihood of volatility.\n\nI do not think we will see as many failed companies, primarily due to the expensive barriers to entry, but also because the financial benefits of AI will cause fundamental growth like margin expansion and potential deflationary effects on the wider economy. That will make AI businesses worth much more than dot-com companies were over the long term. AMD has proven itself to be a stand-out player, and so the likelihood is short-to-medium-term volatility with long-term growth. Now just does not seem to be the most prudent time to allocate to the company as a value investor.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nI think AMD could have periods of turbulence, but as long as it continues to allocate its resources with an effective strategy aimed at value and does not find it needs to invest too heavily in expensive new technologies, which may disrupt its long-term profitability, I believe the long-term returns should be good. It is not quite right for my risk appetite, and I do not believe it works for investors heavily focused on stock valuations, but nonetheless, the company's operations are undeniably strong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?",
        "content": "Shares of Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) have rallied sharply over the past six months, delivering a total return of roughly 66%. Comparably, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 21% over the same period.\n\nThe gain has been driven by improvements in the underlying business, increased estimates for 2024 earnings per share and a re-rating higher in the stock's valuation.\n\nWhile Target has delivered an impressive performance, I believe it is now fully valued and thus, significant outperformance versus the broader market is unlikely.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with TGT. Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?\n\nTGT Data by GuruFocus\n\nCompany overview\n\nTarget is a leading retailer with approximately 1,956 stores across the U.S. The company owns roughly 1,532 of its store properties and fully leases 264 of its locations. The company owns buildings on leased land for 160 of its locations. Thus, unlike most other retailers, the company's real estate holdings make up a significant portion of its value.\n\nKey product categories include food and beverage, apparel and accessories, beauty and household essentials, home furnishings and decor and hardlines.\n\nWhile the bulk of Target's revenue is generated through sales at its physical store locations, the company also has a large online business. For 2023, digitally originated sales accounted for roughly 18% of total sales. Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?\n\nHighly competitive business with thin profit margins\n\nThe retail business is highly competitive. Target competes with a wide range of competitors, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kroger (NYSE:KR), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Temu, Shien and many others.\n\nDespite operating with less scale than players such as Walmart, Amazon or Costco, the company has delivered reasonably strong financial performance. As shown by the chart below, Target has been able to fairly consistently deliver returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital. Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?\n\nWhile Target has done a good job in terms of optimizing its current business and maintaining profitability, it has struggled to consistently grow revenue and profits. The company experienced a boost in sales due to Coid-19 and the ensuing inflation, but has struggled to grow its business since then. For fiscal 2023, the company reported a 1.70% year-over-year decline in total sales, driven by a 3.70% decrease in comparable store sales. Comparably, Walmart reported a 6% increase in total sales for the year. Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?\n\nRecent margin improvements and growth outlook\n\nAs previously noted, one of the key drivers of the recent rally has been improved business performance. Specifically, the company delivered extremely strong margin improvement in 2023, resulting in significant earnings per share growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Target reported adjusted earnings of $8.94 per share, which was a nearly 50% increase from $6.02 in 2022. The increase in earnings was driven entirely by margin expansion as total revenue declined by 1.70% for 2023. Margins benefited from better inventory management, lower freight and logistics costs and other efficiency initiatives.\n\nThe company believes it can deliver same-store sales growth of 0% to 2% and improve margins from 2023 levels of 5.30% toward a longer-term goal of 6%. Target expects 2024 adjusted earnings of $8.60 to $9.60. The midpoint of that estimate implies roughly 2% growth versus 2023, but a high single-digit increase after adjusting for the fact that 2023 included an extra week. Over the long term, the company believes it can deliver annual earnings per share growth in the high single-digit range.\n\nConsensus estimates currently call for the company to report adjusted earnings of $9.39 per share for 2024, which is toward the high end of the company's guidance range.\n\nValuation\n\nCurrently, Target trades at roughly 18 times 2024 consensus earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 22 times estimated earnings. While the retailer has similar medium-term growth prospects to the broader market, I view the discount as appropriate given the highly competitive nature of its business. Additionally, Target's business is highly cyclical, which I believe also supports the argument for a valuation discount versus the broader market.\n\nTarget's closest peer, Walmart, trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 25. While Walmart has similar near-term growth prospects, the company has much more scale and thus is able to offer lower prices, which gives it a competitive edge. Moreover, Walmart earnings tend to be less cyclical given the company's focus on being the low-cost option for consumers. For these reasons, I believe Walmart deserves to trade at a premium to Target.\n\nSix months ago, Target had traded at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.50 and, therefore, has experienced considerable margin expansion. Over the past 10 years, the stock has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of 17.40. As such, the current valuation does not strike me as particularly attractive and suggests significant multiple expansion is unlikely from here.\n\nAdditionally, the stock has a GF Value of roughly $168 per share, which suggests the stock is fairly valued at current levels. Can Target's Recent Outperformance Continue?\n\nPotential upside catalysts\n\nOne potential upside catalyst for Target would be if the company is able to deliver continued margin expansion from current levels, resulting in 2024 earnings coming in ahead of company guidance and current consensus estimates. The company's 5.30% operating margin remains well below the 6% level it experienced prior to the pandemic and the inflationary environment which followed. One potential driver of improved margins from current levels could be an improvement in shrink rates. For 2023, shrink increased by roughly $500 million from 2022 levels, representing a 1.20% operating margin headwind versus 2019.\n\nAnother potential upside catalyst is a stronger-than-anticipated economy, which results in better-than-anticipated consumer spending. As one of the largest retailers in the U.S., Target is highly levered to the strength of the consumer. Strong consumer spending has the potential to allow Target to deliver same-store sales growth in excess of the company's guidance for the year and, in turn, is likely to result in earnings per share coming in ahead of current consensus estimates.\n\nConclusion\n\nTarget shares have experienced strong outperformance versus the broader market over the past few months. The company delivered impressive financial results for 2023, driven by strong margin expansion due to improved operational efficiency.\n\nWhile the company may be able to improve margins further from current levels, any improvement will be fairly limited in nature.\n\nThe stock currently trades at an earnings multiple which is only modestly lower than the broader market despite the fact the company is highly cyclical and operates in a highly competitive industry.\n\nFor these reasons, I view shares as fairly valued and believe it is unlikely that Target's outperformance can continue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon, Apple initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded e.l.f. Beauty(ELF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $190, down from $220. The firm sees the potential for e.l.f. to double its business by fiscal 2027 with shelf space and international expansion as the driving forces. HSBC upgraded Danaher (DHR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $280, up from $250. HSBC's supply chain analysis suggests the de-stocking effects as well as order books might be on a recovery path for the life sciences tools sector. Wells Fargo upgraded Omnicom (OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $106, up from $91. The firm sees upside to the company's organic growth from new business, media trends and \"Flywheel.\" Morgan Stanley upgraded Antero Resources(AR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $26. The firm sees the company providing attractive leverage to rising gas prices and leading exposure to the growing liquified natural fairway in the Gulf Coast. Guggenheim upgraded Group 1 Automotive(GPI) to Buy from Neutral with a $305 price target, calling it the \"best positioned dealer\" to navigate the current landscape, which is \"somehow trading at [the] lowest multiple.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nNorthcoast downgraded Boeing (BA) to Sell from Neutral with a $140 price target. The firm expects Boeing's quarterly earnings report in two weeks to prompt concerns about the company's underlying fundamentals and ultimately shift investor focus to liquidity and acquisition concerns. JPMorgan downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $90, down from $95. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Focus List. The company's Precision Technologies order trends have remained sluggish so far this year, with sales likely down through the first half of 2024 despite support from an excess backlog that is close to being exhausted, JPMorgan says. Jefferies downgraded Urban Outfitters(URBN) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $32, down from $42. The firm's latest data shows a \"notable deceleration\" in rolling three-month foot traffic to all three of Urban's brands. Wells Fargo downgraded EQT Corporation (EQT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $37, down from $48. The firm acknowledges that the recently announced merger with Equitrans Midstream (ETRN) should position the company as a unique \"Gas E&P + Midstream\" entity, resembling a mini super-major, but says it is clear the E&P and midstream investor communities will take some time to embrace this integrated model, versus the prevailing preference for pure-play narratives. Piper Sandler downgraded Marsh McLennan(MMC) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $211. The shares are now \"reasonably valued\" and there is not much in the way of future catalysts that will change that, the firm says.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nMaxim initiated coverage of Amazon.com(AMZN) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm believes the company will be able to exploit consumer internet trends that include advertising, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, healthcare, logistics, and over-the-top, or OTT, video. Maxim initiated coverage of Apple (AAPL) with a Hold rating and $178 price target. Apple is too dependent on China, from a sales and supply-chain standpoint, and it is overweight a single product, the iPhone, when it comes to its near-term operating results, the firm says. Maxim initiated coverage of Beyond (BYND) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm contends that the company will be able to exploit the Consumer Internet trends of 2024 that include international expansion as well as Blockchain and Mobile opportunities. Raymond James initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with an Outperform rating and $160 price target.  The firm looks at Vernova as a mid-single-digit growth story, with power lagging behind wind and electrification. Mizuho initiated coverage of Royal Caribbean(RCL) with a Buy rating and $164 price target. Royal has a unique mix of quality ship assets, as well as differentiated destinations, the combination of which drives upside potential to estimates, says the firm.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget the RIVN Stock Naysayers. Rivian Is Poised to Become the EV King.",
        "content": "Sometimes the Street focuses on the wrong metrics and gets worried about problems that, in the long run, are actually pretty insignificant. For example, I remember that in the early 2010s, many investors were very concerned about Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) margins and spending. Of course, the firm (then known as Google) wound up growing tremendously, making those issues inconsequential. I believe that a similar phenomenon is occurring now with electric-vehicle maker Rivian stock (NASDAQ:RIVN), Specifically, Rivian stock is selling off tremendously as investors fret about the firm’s profitability, the growing pains of the EV market as a whole, and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) problems.\n\nBut these investors’ worries are greatly overdone, and they’re overlooking multiple, strong signs which cumulatively suggest that the automaker is well on its way to becoming one of the world’s premiere EV makers.\n\nAs a result, I recommend that long-term investors buy Rivian stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOverdone Worries\n\nConcerns about Rivian’s profitability have weighed a great deal on the automaker’s shares. But RIVN has, for the most part, steadily cut its gross margin losses, and it expects its gross margins to turn positive in the fourth quarter of this year. Once its gross margins turn positive, it just has to sell more EVs to become profitable. And as you’ll see in the next section, the firm has many levers to pull to enable it to accomplish that goal.\n\nTesla’s recent struggles appear to have weighed on Rivian stock in the last few weeks. But in many ways, Rivian is the opposite of Tesla. Rivian’s U.S. sales and its American market share are rising a great deal, while those of Tesla are dropping significantly.\n\nRivian has upcoming EVs that consumers and the media appear to be excited about, while Tesla’s next steps are uncertain. Rivian has a thriving commercial business that looks poised to keep growing rapidly, while Tesla generates a low percentage of its sales from companies. Tesla has entered most of the world’s markets already ,while Rivian still has a great deal of room to grow overseas. Finally, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, is embroiled in much political controversy, while Rivian doesn’t have that problem at all.\n\nAs for overall EV sales, their growth has slowed tremendously in the U.S., as the number of EVs delivered to customers increased only 2.6% last quarter versus Q1 of 2023. However, Rivian’s Q1 deliveries soared 71% year-over-year last quarter. Moreover, with EVs making up 20% or more of total auto sales in a meaningful number of other, sizeable countries, including Germany, China, and France. Rivian will have plenty of opportunities to increase its EV sales going forward. Moreover, as I noted earlier, the automaker’s sales to North American companies look to set to surge.\n\nStory continues\n\nTremendous Achievements and Huge Opportunities\n\nAt this point, investors are certainly not giving Rivian stock nearly enough credit for its tremendous accomplishments. Amid tremendous competition from many very well-established automakers, including Tesla, Rivian’s R1S SUV was the fourth best-selling EV in the U.S. last quarter, with over 8,000 deliveries. Moreover, although vehicle order totals should be taken with a grain of salt, it’s noteworthy that the automaker obtained over 68,000 reservations for its upcoming R2 SUV in less than 24 hours.\n\nAlso importantly, Rivian won a deal to provide hundreds of thousands of delivery vans to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, by the end of last year, had already given 10,000 of them to the tech giant. Finally, as I’ve noted previously, AT&T (NYSE:T) has agreed to test Rivian’s delivery vans, while auto reseller JB Poindexter & Co, whose customers include Fedex (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS), is selling a new delivery van that utilizes RIVN’s chassis.\n\nGiven the deal with Poindexter and the fact that companies seem to like Rivian’s EVs very much, the EV startup looks poised to generate a great deal of revenue by providing its EVs to firms. In the longer term, those revenue streams should boost Rivian stock tremendously. Meanwhile, based on the high order total for the R2 and the buzz online about it, that EV, due to be launched in 2026, should positively move the needle for Rivian.\n\nAdditionally, Rivian plans to bring the R2 to Europe, where EVs are much more mainstream. As a result, I believe that the EV could become a tremendous hit on that continent. And finally, the automaker will likely start generating positive gross margins in Q4, making many investors more upbeat about its ability to become profitable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and , AMZN.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Amazon (AMZN) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in AMZN?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.08.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why the CEO of a $12 billion pet services company still responds to customer emails himself",
        "content": "On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, co-hosts Alan Murray and Michal Lev-Ram sit down with Chewy CEO Sumit Singh. They discuss maintaining a customer-forward business even when scaling up, why the Chewy customer service experience is akin to that of a Disney park or high-end resort, and why the company launched B2B services for veterinarians. Singh also explains why he thinks Chewy's only competition is the company itself. \"I believe we control our destiny much more than anybody else can do anything to us,\" he says.\n\nListen to the episode or read the transcript below.\n\nTranscript\n\nAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.\n\nWelcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I’m Alan Murray.\n\nMichal Lev-Ram: And I’m Michal Lev-Ram.\n\nMurray: Michal, I hear the background noise. Where are you?\n\nLev-Ram: I'm in Spokane, Washington. I struggled to find a quiet spot today, so I am in the hotel lobby. Pardon the noise. Sorry, but I'm excited to be here.\n\nMurray: Today's guest is Sumit Singh, the CEO of Chewy, the pet company. It was a really fun conversation.\n\nLev-Ram: It was. It was. Everybody relates to pets, right? Or almost everybody. We should know the percentage.\n\nMurray: Well, everyone relates to pets and they related to their pets even more when the pandemic hit, and Chewy's stock soared for a period of time. I think it's come back down to earth since then. But clearly, Chewy is the dominant player in pet e-commerce. And who knew that was a category?\n\nLev-Ram: Who knew also that we're supposed to say pet parent and not pet owner anymore, Alan? So make sure you get the right lingo. Yeah, I know. It was a really fascinating conversation and yes, pet e-commerce, but they've also expanded into health care. It's the first episode where we got to talk about our own pets, Alan, and you told a very sweet story about Cooper.\n\nMurray: Oh yeah. Well, I'll leave that for the podcast. It's sad talking about Cooper. But the one thing Cooper was never able to do was come to the office and at Chewy, all the pets come to the office, including simians.\n\nLev-Ram: Yes, and we heard that even some pigs, I think, came to the office. People have all sorts of strange pets. So anyways, we also got into Chewy's vision for how AI can assist customer service, not replace it, and a lot of other great topics.\n\nStory continues\n\nMurray: Yeah. So let's go pet our pets and let's dive right in. Sumit Singh of Chewy.\n\nSumit, welcome to Leadership Next. Great to have you here.\n\nSumit Singh: Great to be here.\n\nMurray: You've had a wild ride over the last six years. You joined this company, you were part of the spin out from PetSmart that happened in 2019?\n\nSingh: Yes.\n\nMurray: Right before the pandemic. The pandemic hit, everybody fell in love with their dogs and more. You had an incredible soaring stock price. It's come down significantly since then. Tell us a little bit about that journey. I mean, there are not many CEOs who have a roller coaster ride like that.\n\nSingh: It's been amazing. As I was just sharing, I've been dancing into work every day for the last six-and-a-half years. And why wouldn't you? I mean, you have you know, we're working through an amazing mission of making pets happy. And it's a people business. And we get to see our pets every day at work. So it's pretty awesome.\n\nMurray: Everyone brings pets to work?\n\nSingh: If you come to the Chewy office. I mean, the amount of—we were thinking, how are we going to get any work done and how do you kind of keep all these pets in check? But believe it or not, everybody behaves, and it just works.\n\nMurray: It sounds like sheer chaos.\n\nSingh: We've had, you know, besides dogs and cats, we've had potbellied pigs and we've had hamsters and...\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nMurray: But I wonder if outside of the Chewy office, if the enthusiasm is waning, clearly people are being called back to work. You know, your stock price has come down. What's the future look like?\n\nSingh: So, no, no, it's not waning. In fact, you know, we are super excited and in many ways we feel like we're just getting started. So here's how you want to think about us. So when I was sort of looking at the company and saying, okay, where do we move forward from, the founding team did an amazing job, and, you know, we got the company to about a billion, about a billion-and-a-half mark. And we said, okay, how do you build this into a $12, $15, $20 billion retailer? And so, you know, at that time it was important to realize the mission and purpose that we wanted to serve. And that became we want to be the most trusted, convenient destination for pet parents and partners everywhere. Sounds like a mouthful, but there's really only three pieces that are important here: trusted and convenient, destination for both pet parents and partners, and everywhere. By trusted and convenient because in a pet business, in this business, it is the only category outside of kids where customers refer to themselves as pet parents. It's emotive.\n\nMurray: Yeah.\n\nSingh: And so you have to build and lead through trust and that builds loyalty, and so that's sort of the first part of it. Destination because what we realized see, Chewy was founded as a food and supplies company. We would serve you your food, we would, you know, ship you your dog collars and beds and all that stuff. But there's much more to a pet's journey than that, a pet’s lifecycle than that. There's an entire health world to go. There are non-health care services.\n\nAnd then why just pet parents? Think about the community that services pet, right? The veterinarian, the groomer, the trainer, the dog park friend? Looking for content, servicing pets, etc. And we said, well, why should we only stand for customers? Let's stand for partners. And what that tells you is from a business mindset, what he was saying was we should be a B2C, a B2B company, etc.\n\nAnd then the last part, everywhere. Why? Because we believe our brand is resilient outside of the United States, and pet parents are more or less the same in any region of the world. So if you put that together, Alan, you not only get a mission and purpose that people can get behind, you get the strategy of the organization, and at any point you can look at that and say, well, where are you trending in fulfilling this journey? And it's meant to be enduring. So over the last six years, we have really built out our health vertical and I'm happy to kind of dive deeper into it. So we're very proud of that. So we've connected food supplies and health. We've built out B2C services, B2B services for veterinarians, and so we're super proud. And we've just entered Canada as our first international foray.\n\nMurray: So you have a lot of [cross-talk].\n\nSingh: From my vantage point, there's still a lot of innovation to be had. And people, you know, our teams love that.\n\nLev-Ram: So I'm probably an anomaly in that I think of myself as a pet owner still, not a pet parent, but that's because I have enough kids. So my my dog is, I just own him. But I totally see that Chewy as a customer, I guess, can sense that customer loyalty and the way that you view your customers as so special. And we all know e-commerce is a tough business. Just tell us a little bit more about your philosophy, the underlying philosophy for customer service and customer loyalty.\n\nSingh: Yeah, the inspiration, first of all, I have a personal experience to share. So when I arrived at Chewy, I'm a product of consumer tech experience forward companies, Dell being one, Amazon being the other. And these companies are great in the way that they build products, from understanding customers and the way to deploy supply chain technology operations and technology, etc. But they're also very heavily efficiency oriented. And so when I got to Chewy, I was like, well, great, it's just a customer service or customer care team and this is the journey sometimes you as a leader need to observe and evolve to be able to truly assimilate through what is a gold nugget in the foundation or the growth of a company stage. And I looked at our customer care and I experienced it, and as I experienced our customer care, I did not think about any customer care organization. I thought about Disney, my experience when I walked through a Disney park and how we feel in the way that, you just feel like you're a part of a dream world like without being welcomed. I compare Chewy to the best hospitality resorts in the way that you are served in, the way that you are treated, and the way that you're received, and in the way that you're respected when you walk through the best hospitality resorts. So that's the mindset in the way that we approach customer service, right? So if I were to summarize this from a business point of view, I would say Chewy is delivering the scale and convenience of e-commerce, but at the best personalized service or high-touch personalized service you should expect of the best local neighborhood pet store.\n\nLev-Ram: Can you share this story real quick of this incident that kind of went viral where somebody a customer's pet died and you sent a message? Can you tell the story?\n\nSingh: Yeah, you know, the story essentially goes we have what we call surprise and delight moments where we want to be with the customer's life cycle or journey through the highs and lows of pet parenting. And this moment that you're referring is a low of pet parenting when somebody's pet passed away. And when that happens, we sent flowers because at that moment we are sympathetic, empathetic, we send flowers, we send greetings, handwritten cards. And that moment is a very special moment because most companies will not invest, you know, X number of dollars to be able to pick up flowers to send to customers and be there right in that moment for them. And posts like these, that's not the only thing we do. We send you handwritten birthday cards. We send you welcome cards. We will send you surprise and delight. We work with over 1,000 local artists where we will send you hand-drawn pet portraits, which you cannot buy from us. They will show up to your doorstep surprise and delight. And let me tell you this, when you get a hand-drawn pet portrait of your beloved pet, I have you for life.\n\nMurray: Yeah. Well, actually it's funny you say that because I saw a list someone did a ranking of brands' brand affiliation. I think it was Newsweek and Chewy showed up in the No. 1 spot. Amazon was in the No. 2 spot, which must have been a great pleasure to you as somebody who worked at Amazon.\n\nSingh: Proud of it. Yes. Yes.\n\nMurray: Can you talk a little bit about how you got here to tell us about how you weren't a pet guy to begin with? Tell us your journey to this job.\n\nSingh: Yeah, so I think, you know, ultimately we are all a product of our experiences and learnings that come along the way, both Amazon and Dell. So I grew up in middle-class India and grew up with the values of high respect for the kind of education and humility and curiosity and resilience. And you get to America and you're exposed to this massive, amazing land of opportunity and you say, great, I mean, this is a place to learn and innovate and forward can integrate. And so, you know, I was fortunate to be a part of amazing companies like Dell and Amazon, which are pioneers in their own fields. And, you know, ultimately at Amazon, I ended up being a part or a leader that was helping grow the fresh business grocery and grocery is a very difficult business to crack. I mean, imagine forecasting seven types of bananas. Imagine shipping chicken across the country. Imagine trying to ship sushi across Japan. I mean, the Japanese have very, very high standards for stuff like this. So essentially it's not in the desire to do it. It's how you work backwards from your customer to truly understand the inputs that essentially appeal and are desirable, and then perfect your processes to be able to serve that experience.\n\nSo that job taught me a lot. It taught me about how to run perishable, consumable businesses. It taught me how to manage tough P&Ls, because imagine shipping cat litter across the country—you’re essentially shipping sand. How do you make money shipping sand across the country? These are heavy, bulky boxes, and yet our profitability has never been higher. And our free cash flow has never been higher either. And so I got to Chewy with that mindset, with that training. And I picked up, culturally I was always customer forward. And that is something that I'm super proud that we have retained. You know, it's easy for startups sometimes and I'm not saying this would have happened at Chewy, but generally when you start up in a category, everybody says they’re customer forward and then the demands of the scale come and the complexity comes and suddenly, customer orientation goes out the door and profitability takes over or process efficiency takes over, and the company starts losing its culture. I am proud to say we maintained a culture of insurgency, right? We maintained a culture of innovation, a culture of customer service. I still read every email. My email is available on LinkedIn. Customers contact me, and when they do this, I learned from Jeff Bezos at Amazon, where I still take those emails and flow them through the company and we try to learn. So essentially, Alan, if you walk through the organization, what you should be looking for is not if the CEO is talking the language, you should be watching if the people are talking the language. And I think our people are talking the language, you know, they're servicing the language.\n\nMurray: Do you still reply to customer emails in your inbox? And if you do, how many of those do you write a day?\n\nSingh: I do. I did one yesterday night and my average service level response time is less than 20 minutes. It's become a template now because I truly believe it and it starts out by, “Thank you for writing to me.” And you know, sorry that we've disappointed you by not providing you top-class service. That is not the norm at Chewy and we take feedback very seriously.\n\nMurray: Yeah.\n\nSingh: I do and my teams are aware of that. And then we have a mechanism where we will reach out to the customer to understand what truly happened so that we can bring it back and solve that challenge. You know, there's a term in corporations that's called killing the zombies. And most companies don't do this, but they'll take care of you. But then they'll never really fix that situation, right? They'll never really fix that problem. So then the next customer, right, is going to have the same issue. We call it killing the zombies. Did you essentially ask the five whys, get to the root of the issue and build it from the ground back up?\n\nLev-Ram: You talked a bit about how your customer base has expanded. You're thinking about your customer base and the partners that you serve. Can you explain how you're looking at also expanding the business into different, completely different areas like health care? What's the opportunity there and how are you approaching it?\n\nSingh: In our opinion, health, animal health is the next frontier. I mean, health seems to be the next frontier. And animal health is certainly the next frontier. There are several trends that have been shaping up the animal health industry. First of all, if you've taken your dog to a vet, the health industry is and human health was here 20 years ago. So we're just sort of lagging human health in that way. But it's looking back 50 years. It's a legacy industry where technology is not necessarily empowering experiences, it's not empowering flexible scheduling or servicing through work life needs. That’s sort of one dynamic. The second dynamic is that we haven't been producing enough veterinarians. And so if you fast forward five years, the capacity for veterinarians is going to underrun demand for veterinarians. The third challenge or opportunity, depending on how you look at it, is the current vet base is maturing and retiring and the new ones that are coming in are younger, they're primarily female, and they are not only customer oriented, they're also interested in these work life concepts much more. And so we sort of took a look at this and we said, okay, let's go start with just the product side. So we first build veterinarian prescription diet, so food, and then we got into pharmacy or medication. Today we run the largest pharmacy in the country.\n\nMurray: You're not creating drugs. You're selling drugs.\n\nSingh: We are selling drugs. We are over a billion dollars in that portfolio and we are the largest pharmacy in the country at this point. And all of this has happened in just the last four, four and a half years, right? And then the pandemic happened and the veterinarians were under lockdown and customers were under lockdown. And if Cooper at that particular time had eaten a chocolate, who would have caught, you would have been close.\n\nMurray: Yeah, we're going to talk about Cooper in a minute.\n\nSingh: So we started getting calls and we said, great, let's go develop a telehealth service. And that's what we did. That's how telehealth was born at Chewy. And, you know, in about 60 days, we're a tech-forward organization. So in about 60 days, we were able to launch a telehealth service, and that was great. And then we launched into insurance. And so if you fast forward this, we've now built a suite of products and services for customers and veterinarians that we are now taking together and saying this is a software out of the box, you can give this to a graduating vet and say, here, go run your practice out of the living room. Go run it out of your garage or go set up your own shop if you want to. And oh, by the way, if you don't want to do any of those, we are opening our own clinics. You can come work with you.\n\nMurray: Well, how big is the B2B business compared to the B2C business?\n\nSingh: The B2C is is the majority of the business because B2B, we've only stepped in about a year, year-and-a-half ago. So it's very new but ramping fast.\n\nLev-Ram: And you have clinics, Chewy clinics already are launching?\n\nSingh: We launched our first one in South Florida two weeks ago and we're very excited about it. We're launching new ones in Atlanta, in Denver, and so forth and so on. We're going to launch six to eight this year.\n\nLev-Ram: How have you not gotten into the pet hotel business?\n\nMurray: I was just going to ask the same question. So that's what we all need is boarding.\n\nSingh: So that's the third vertical—that completes the destination is non-health care services. And why we have not is not because I mean, clearly it's in our mission to be able to do service customers in that arena. But it's just been a matter of prioritization. Chewy, you know, sometimes we forget that Chewy is only a 12-year-old company and since IPOing in 2019, our revenue was $3 billion, right? So in the last four or five years, we've essentially grown revenue four times to $12 billion. That's what we've guided at midpoint this year. And so it's just a matter of prioritization. We wanted to build out the health platform fully. What the health platform has done is I'm going to take a ten second detour here. We first built fundamentally the technology or the architecture of the organization. Now that is done, we are 100% on the cloud. We have a fully services-oriented architecture and we have pet data, vet data, and customer data all residing in one data mart. It allows us to be able to utilize the same platform to point instead of a veterinarian towards a puppy trainer or towards a dog lover.\n\nMurray: Who's your competition?\n\nSingh: Ourselves.\n\nMurray: You don't see anyone else out there.\n\nSingh: Now, I don't mean to be glib about that. No. So I'll answer this in two ways. One, I believe we control our destiny much more than anybody else can do anything to us. So in that way, I want my teams to feel like, you know, the speed of innovation and the quality and longevity of customer care is ultimately what will differentiate us because that is what has gotten us here. And if you study companies over a 100-year period, enduring companies have essentially stuck with these two. They've been innovative in many fields. Innovation can happen in any field possible, and they've maintained kind of the value proposition across care and the longevity around it. Now, of course, if you look at pet, pet has become really interesting in the last ten years or so. Pet was a sleepy, used to be a sleepy category. Right? And the last ten years and I would like to think that you have something to do with this because we stepped in and stepped up the innovation curve in the industry. And when you innovate on the customer's behalf, it attracts attention.\n\nMurray: And you spun out of PetSmart?\n\nSingh: Yes.\n\nMurray: If you were PetSmart sitting there, wouldn't you say, Boy, we made a big mistake. I mean, we signed our own death certificate there. Why are we allowing somebody else to take all the online interactive benefits?\n\nSingh: Yeah, I think our sponsor, BC Partners, they had the long-term vision to be able to say, look like, you know, these are two organizations with two different cultures. And as a leadership team, we sat across the table and kind of talked about that, it just made more sense to let the organization kind of preserve an individual identity and move forward with the mission that we were doing now.\n\n[Music starts.]\n\nMurray: Now, I'm here with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, who had the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Jason, thank you very much for joining me.\n\nJason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nMurray: Jason, the majority of Fortune 500 companies have made commitments to reach net zero to address climate, but it's still unclear how they actually get there. What's the role of technology in meeting those ambitious goals?\n\nGirzadas: There's a broad recognition that the cost of climate change is far greater than the cost of not investing in it. Organizations will continue to utilize technology to move on the journey towards a decarbonized future and a more circular economy. We're already seeing the benefit of technology through an increase in alternative energy sources. The advances in battery and storage technology are evident. You're seeing the growth and increased performance of EVs at lower price points. So, the impact and value of technology is being felt already, and that's only going to continue. It's pretty clear that climate change requires innovations that don't exist today, but we do think that there will be new opportunities for innovation to be further accelerated through the development of ecosystems around emerging technologies.\n\nMurray: There's clearly a lot to do on this front. You talk to a lot of CEOs about this. Do you feel there's a real sense of urgency on meeting these commitments?\n\nGirzadas: The urgency is there. The call to action around climate change and the path to sustainability is there and the impact of climate change is real. I think the narrative is shifting. One from it being a cost and an inconvenience to decarbonize our economy to one where it's actually an opportunity. The client organizations that we serve are in their own way charting a path to a sustainable future.\n\nMurray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.\n\nGirzadas: Thank you.\n\n[Music ends.]\n\nMurray: You had previously told Fortune that you learned the question mark strategy from Jeff Bezos. Any other things you took away from Jeff Bezos?\n\nSingh: A lot. You know, Amazon is an amazing, amazing culture. There's a Chinese saying that when the student is ready, the teacher will come. You should be able to learn anything from anywhere. But really, it's a customer-forward principal-led organization. And so, you learn the power of really how to think well and how to build alongside that. You learn the power of building mechanisms and routines that really allow you to stay focused as you scale. And I think the document culture at Amazon is just an amazing format that Jeff invented.\n\nMurray: Talk about technology because we know every industry is being rapidly transformed by AI and now generative AI. What is it doing to Chewy?\n\nSingh: Yeah, I love this topic. Yeah, we are going to live. I mean, we are already living in it, but it's going to continue to get more fascinating from this point onwards. And it's a bit of a tale of two cities. So let's talk about the first one. First of all, innovation will happen across many different sectors. And that's like Zen master of the obvious. So let me kind of be specific. If you look at the world of supply chain and operations, I think this concept of digital twins will end up disrupting supply chain and operations in the way planning manufacturing, supply chain operations is run, planned, simulated and run. It will improve accuracy. It will drive precision into planning systems, and it will drive accuracy of execution and ultimately drive greater productivity through the systems. So that's sort of like one.\n\nThen you come to the area of helping customers search, discover, and interact with your products. Could be in any industry. So for Chewy, for example, if you walked in and said, How do I raise a Labrador puppy? You're going to be able to have real time interactions with the system alongside really personalized recommendations. So the world of search and discover will change pretty rapidly. Then you go to science-driven functions, whether it's marketing, science, customer service operations, or supply chain science. Machine learning has already been disrupting a bunch of this. And now we're talking of combining context with natural language processing into these techniques. It's just going to drive a hyper level of efficiency, in my opinion. So that's one I said. It's a tale of two cities. That's one. What's the other side? The other side, I think, is governance, right? So how we govern, how we move forward, how we think about sort of how much autonomy a team should have, how much data should be exposed, how do you protect that data and use it wisely, I think are all of the conversations that we are likely going to have to step into concurrently as we're working through this.\n\nLev-Ram: One follow-up question on the tech piece. On the customer service side, for a company that's so, so much of your DNA and and your culture is around customer loyalty and this really like high-touch customer service, you're talking about handwritten notes, not a lot of e-commerce companies do that. How do you look at the opportunities with some of these AI-powered chat bots, agents to help with customer service without diluting everything that you guys stand for?\n\nSingh: I love that question. It is natural to assume that technology and personalization or technology and creativity are conflicting with each other. And I think what we have to realize is that human beings are great at creativity. They always will be. And technology is great at delivering scale. And so you have to marry these up smartly, right? Our local artists or our handwritten notes in a way that we assimilate through the language, right, is a very personalized mechanism that we are seeking to keep. At the same time, I can automate all of the segmentation of customers, the targeting of customers, the identification of those cohorts. I can also automate how I pick up the right portrait when a customer uploads a pet profile and pass it on to my artist pretty digitally and pretty seamlessly. So I've essentially eliminated process waste without really taking out creativity from the system.\n\nWe're developing something called a tool which is called CSR Buddy. It is meant to be a friend to the customer service or the customer care team. It's essentially a prompter tool. It has all information about the customer. It has a knowledge base which will marry content to let them have more intelligent conversations. We try not to hire from deeply ingrained CS contact centers because we have to untrain them to get them to unlearn the bad habits of getting the customer off the phone. We want to pick up your phone in two rings or less, right? And so we tell our agents, just have a conversation.\n\nMurray: So you're using the technology not to replace the customer service representative…\n\nSingh: Nope.\n\nMurray: …but to give them all the information they need to be great at their job.\n\nSingh: They shouldn't spend time looking for information. They should spend time having the conversation. That's the difference.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay, so before we get into talking about our own respective pets, which is very, very important, of course, tell us a little bit about just pet ownership or pet parenting trends, I should say, because obviously we saw this insane growth during the pandemic, which I'm sure helped your business out quite a bit. That's kind of dropped off a little in the last couple of years, I'm guessing. But what do you know about pet trends today and the demographics?\n\nSingh: So, to really get to this point you have to rewind about 15 years, 20 years. You know, the word that's often used in the pet industry is humanization of pet. And what does that mean? All that means is that 20 years ago or 30 years ago, the pet was out on the porch. Today they're on the couch, they're in your bed, and today you refer to them as family. So that's this concept of humanization of pet. We treat them as family. We treat them as one of our own. So what has that done? What that's done is it's led to the consumer wanting to be more aware and feel like a better pet parent when I'm treating my pet right, but I'm also feeding them right and I'm buying the best toys for them, etc. So what did that do? That led to premiumization of products, right? So in the last 15 years, you've seen this conditional-based segment, what we call Science Diet. You've seen the premium segments come forward. You're seeing freeze dried, raw, dehydrated, fresh food. Now, this is essentially the consumer being aware that I am going to treat you the same as I treat perhaps another family member. So really, if you track the industry over the last 20 years, it isn't tonnage growth that has driven the industry forward. It is product innovation and premiumization, which is linked back to this humanization trend. Now let's talk about the pandemic. It is a bit of a fallacy to think that every household got a pet during the pandemic.\n\nMurray: It was just 95% of households.\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nSingh: No, no, no, no, no, Alan, you know what happened? It's actually if you look at the data, supply actually shrunk during the pandemic. Now, why is that? It's because, so shelters feed 60% of new pet adoption in the country. The rest, 40%, comes from breeders. The shelter and rescue community was immediately out of pets in the first six months of the pandemic. Then nobody was returning pets. So they were empty. And then the breeders, I mean, that's a biological process. You can’t produce more litters suddenly if you wanted to. And so if you really think through this mathematically, you will see it in the data that there was a bump that kind of came in the first six or nine months, but then for the next 12, 15 months, pet supply shrunk because there was no more demand to be served per se. Why companies saw a bump is because we were all at home with our pets and we were feeding them constantly. We were engaging with them constantly. You notice that you needed a dog bed refresh. You said, Oh, there's that new treat. Oh, well, wouldn't it be nice to buy this good toy? And so you were overspending on your pet from that point of view because everybody was at home.\n\nMurray: Yeah. With it.\n\nSingh: With it. And it would by the way, that was great for pharmacy because pets were probably getting fatter, you know, sitting at home. So our health [cross talk] getting slightly better, benefited from that threat.\n\nLev-Ram: Is there Ozempic for pets now?\n\nSingh: [Laughing.] Is there…\n\nMurray: There will be Ozempic for pets. I'm sure Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are already working on that.\n\nSingh: So fast forward through COVID. What happened? Supply chains got disrupted and as supply chains are recovering and inflation's passing through the system. We've had 30% inflation pass through the system in the last two years versus you would ask me what is an average year? Two percent.\n\nMurray: Yeah.\n\nSingh: So when you have that sort of an imbalance, so really pandemic, the pandemic shouldn't be looked at as a two-and-a-half-year curve. It's really a five-year curve. With 2024 being the fifth year. And so that's why we're calling this the year of normalization.\n\nMurray: Yeah. So we're going to get to some sort of a stable place and you're confident about that.\n\nSingh: Absolutely.\n\nMurray: And okay, so what is the dog that is by your side when you go to the office?\n\nSingh: It's my dog, D, the Shih Tzu.\n\nMurray: And what, tell us about D.\n\nSingh: Well, D’s a Shih Tzu. He is 11 years old now and he's been with us for nine of the last 11 or ten of the last 11 years. I would say he's quite not like a dog. Doesn't like to be on your lap. You know, contrary to most Shih Tzus. He is negatively correlated to our forecasts. So, you know, he's the chief pet, the treat tester. But if he loves a treat, I would short that forecast.\n\nMurray: And know he's not a good time and does he act like the CEO of the office?\n\nSingh: I don't think he realizes he's just…\n\nMurray: That he has special privileges.\n\nLev-Ram: He's just like any other dog in the Chewy office. Well, it's funny you talked about sort of this evolution of how we view our pets, because I definitely feel it in my own family. When I was growing up, my sisters and I would beg our parents for a dog and my dad always said, We can get a dog if you let me train him to attack. And we said, No thanks, us three girls. Fast forward to today. I have a miniature poodle. He sleeps on our bed. His name is Teddy and he is very much part of the family. Even though I say I own him, he's not my child. Because again, I have three actual kids. So that's enough.\n\nMurray: And once he gets in your way in the bed, I mean, you like, kick him over or just see respectful.\n\nLev-Ram: He's a miniature poodle, so he's not really in the way.\n\nMurray: That helps.\n\nSingh: Teddy is a great name though.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, what about you, Alan?\n\nMurray: Well, the Cooper story. So Cooper was a yellow lab that my youngest daughter adopted when she was in high school. Took him with her to college. He lived for a while in a co-ed fraternity where he got to, like, clean up all the beer pong and the pizza on the day after. Very tough life. But lived to be 15 years old, eventually came back home to stay with us because my daughter was spending time with a guy who was allergic to dogs, unfortunately. Anyway, we had to put him to sleep. He couldn't walk anymore. And she came home and took him on the most epic weekend, took him to the ocean and spent some time walking into the ocean, took him back to the school and to see the old fraternity hang out, fed him Popeye's fried chicken and chocolate and all the things you're not supposed to give a dog. It was an amazing event. So, yeah, I get it. I get it. These are an important part of our life.\n\nLev-Ram: That's quite a quite a last dinner to give a dog. I'm sure it was a wonderful weekend for him. This has been just such an awesome conversation. First opportunity I think we've had on Leadership Next to actually talk about our pets. So thank you so much for joining us.\n\nSingh: It was really nice to see you. Thank you so much.\n\nMurray: Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla.\n\nLev-Ram: Our executive producer is Chris Joslin.\n\nMurray: Our theme is by Jason Snell.\n\nLev-Ram: Leadership Next is a production of Fortune Media.\n\nMurray: Leadership Next episodes are produced by Fortune’s editorial team.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +161.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.45 billion and $715.74 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here Are My Top 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "There's no hotter topic in technology today than artificial intelligence (AI). Breakthroughs from ChatGPT and competing platforms have captivated both tech enthusiasts and investors. But with so many companies trying to make waves in the AI realm, investors can become exhausted trying to identify the most compelling opportunities.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia -- are the usual suspects in the AI spotlight. Below, I'll break down the three megacap tech behemoths I think are the strongest buys right now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft kicked off the AI revolution with its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI in early 2023. OpenAI is the start-up behind the wildly successful AI application ChatGPT.\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT throughout its Windows operating system. The technology has helped spear gains in the company's Azure cloud computing platform, as well as Microsoft's developer product GitHub.\n\nThe investment in OpenAI appears to be paying off in spades. It's no wonder that top tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has proclaimed that Microsoft's \"iPhone moment\" has arrived.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's ecosystem represents something bigger than just new revenue opportunities. Microsoft has transformed from a personal computing empire to a leader in cloud computing and is now evolving into a full-blown AI powerhouse.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 36, Microsoft stock isn't exactly cheap. The forward P/E of the S&P 500 is just under 21. However, the company's robust cash-flow machine and diversified business model is hard to pass over -- especially when it comes to the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMicrosoft is a top investing opportunity as the AI narrative continues to play out. Now is a great time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to add to an existing position or initiate a new one. Prepare to hold for the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAlthough Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI was the talk of the town for a while, e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon made a splash of its own -- investing $4 billion in a competing platform called Anthropic. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon as its primary cloud provider.\n\nMoreover, the AI start-up will also be leveraging Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips to train future generative AI models. The relationship with Anthropic should serve as a bellwether to accelerate growth -- particularly in the cloud computing arena.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Amazon's $36.8 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow and $86 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, it's no wonder that both Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett own the stock. The company has a tremendous level of financial flexibility and is in a unique position to invest in many areas across the AI realm.\n\nTrading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 3.4, Amazon stock looks attractive, compared to historical valuation levels. Moreover, it's the lowest-valued stock in the Magnificent Seven, based on this metric. Currently, there's an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares in Amazon as its breakthroughs in AI continue to unfold. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nThe last Magnificent Seven company I'll be exploring is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms, which dominates the social media realm through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the company is also making inroads in gaming through its popular virtual reality (VR) business Meta Quest.\n\n2023 was a key year for Meta. The company spent much of it using a series of layoffs to right-size its expense profile and shift its focus to accelerated profit margins. While Meta grew its top line by 16% last year, its operating income soared by 62%. The newfound margin expansion flowed directly to the bottom line, as net income increased 69% year over year.\n\nWith $43 billion of free cash flow, Meta has found no shortage of ways to reinvest in the business. The company increased its share-buyback program by $50 billion and announced a quarterly dividend.\n\nOn top of that, Meta is making impressive inroads in the AI space. The company is building its own chips to compete with industry titan Nvidia. Moreover, by combining these chips with its existing library of data from its various social media platforms, Meta is uniquely positioned to ignite a new phase of growth for its core advertising operation.\n\nAlthough its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.3 is a bit pricey compared to peers, I see the premium as warranted. Meta is a cash machine and has found ways to reward shareholders while also aggressively pursuing AI, the next frontier in technology at large.\n\nThere's currently a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares in Meta and benefit from the passive-income opportunity from the dividend, while also keeping a close eye on the company's further progress in AI.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Dermatologists say girls are getting rashes and worse from beauty products pitched by influencers and that it ‘needs to be addressed’",
        "content": "Dr. Elizabeth Houshmand remembers the day a nine-year-old appeared in her Dallas dermatology clinic with a rash on her face from a cleanser containing glycolic acid she had seen on TikTok and bought with her mom’s help to treat her skin problems. Glycolic acid, which is used as an acne and anti-aging serum, is approved for use by adults but is generally unsafe for kids because it can be too strong for their still developing skin.\n\nThe girl’s rash eventually went away without causing any permanent damage. But it shows the dangers lurking on services like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, which are rife with influencers hawking skincare products that are potentially dangerous to minors.\n\n“You can use social media for such a greater good—educating on skin cancers, melanoma—but then I think this aspect of monetizing and targeting that [young] age demographic is something that needs to be addressed,” said Houshmand, who also chairs the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery’s social media committee.\n\nShe and another dermatologist told Fortune that young girls—from nine to 14-years old—routinely visit their clinics with skin damage after using products they bought after seeing influencers post about them on social media. Many of those impacted are looking to mimic their favorite influencers and gain cool girl status for owning and using viral products.\n\nIn some cases, the influencers, not just on TikTok, but also on Instagram, YouTube, Amazon and other platforms, make money from pitching the skin products that can end up being harmful to young skin. They can earn commissions by directly linking to skincare products that can be purchased online.\n\nWhatever the case, it feeds into the internet version of the phenomenon known as “Sephora kids,” young girls frequenting beauty chain Sephora to sample and buy skincare products. When shopping online, kids may be unaware of the dangers of certain ingredients to their skin and can be susceptible to buying fake and scam products that could also be dangerous.\n\nSocial media's skincare obsession\n\nThe skin obsession on social media largely started in the last few years with popular influencers posting “get ready with me” videos, which often go by the acronym GRWM across social media. The clips are characterized by the stars talking through makeup and skincare routines, selfie-style in intimate settings like bedrooms and bathrooms. The videos have led millions of girls and women to post their own clips showing them washing their faces and applying makeup—taking viewers through their often-complicated preparations for dates, school, church, and many other occasions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn turn, personal care brands, as well as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Amazon, and the influencers themselves, have turned these GRWM videos into a lucrative corner of the creator economy as they seamlessly connect product endorsements and glamorous online personalities.\n\nThe videos have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with TikTok Shop, the platform’s ecommerce offering that debuted in September. TikTok hopes ecommerce will become a growth engine that supplements its core advertising business. Influencers who sign up for TikTok Shop can tag TikTok Shop products—ranging from bags of chips to skin moisturizers—in their videos so that users can buy those products within the app. The influencers who work with the brands on TikTok Shop take a cut of everything sold through the links.\n\nTikTok has implemented a number of guardrails to prevent harm to kids. Users must be 18 or older to view, sell, and purchase items through TikTok Shop. But many young users lie about their age when they sign up for the service.\n\nSome of the most popular brands among kids, like Drunk Elephant, have no official TikTok Shop presence and say they don’t sell through third parties. Yet some merchants on the platform still claim to sell their products, often with discounts from retail prices—a telltale sign that they may be fake and therefore more likely to be manufactured with risky ingredients, or come with inflated shipping costs.\n\nFortune found eight different sellers on TikTok Shop claiming to sell Drunk Elephant products without permission. One of the merchants selling the company’s products was Hudson-Litchfield Youth Football & Cheer. Fortune asked the organization why the New Hampshire youth football and cheer league was selling Drunk Elephant on TikTok Shop, but did not get a response. To become a TikTok Shop seller, users need only upload a government issued ID to the platform and link their bank and TikTok accounts.\n\nA Drunk Elephant spokesperson told Fortune that since the company doesn’t sell products on TikTok Shop, it “cannot verify the authenticity or quality of any Drunk Elephant products appearing there.”\n\nDrunk Elephant does have a TikTok account that it uses to market itself, at times to children. In one video, founder and chief creative officer Tiffany Masterson spoke positively about kids buying the company’s products. She said that the company has “something that’s appropriate for every age\" and went on to say that girls buying Drunk Elephant products is “great” because they’re learning to take care of their skin. “My guess is their skin is going to look a lot better than other people’s skin because they’re learning all of this on TikTok,” Masterson said.\n\nChildren say they're careful\n\nTikTok declined to comment on record to Fortune about children buying beauty products through its platform. Facilitating sales of the beauty and skincare products to children isn’t illegal and neither the Food and Drug Administration nor TikTok requires companies to attach warning labels to products that may be harmful to children.\n\nTikTok prohibits counterfeit products on Shop. Using automation, it detects and removes 93% of products that violate intellectual property rules before the products are ever publicly listed, the company said.\n\nTikTok also encourages users and brands to report counterfeits. Users who have posted videos of themselves buying fake products on TikTok report that the company removed those products from Shop shortly after.\n\nMerchants who violate the rules risk being kicked off TikTok Shop.\n\nChildren interviewed by Fortune have mixed opinions about the dangers of beauty products on TikTok. Some were scared of the risk of counterfeits, while others were unphased.\n\nFourteen-year-old influencer Chelsea Lascher, who has 3.3 million TikTok followers, told Fortune she has never bought products from TikTok Shop. But she notes that all her friends have, including one who bought lip tint for around $2, only to pay around $20 for shipping. She notes her friend was not harmed by the product. “TikTok Shop may be a little unsafe, because there could be products that aren’t using what they should be—that's why it's so cheap,” Lascher says. “Things that are $3 to $2, I think are fake and could be bad for the skin.”\n\nMeanwhile, Naziyah, a 13-year-old influencer whose mom agreed that Fortune could interview her daughter, but only use her first name, said that neither she nor her friends had seen scams or fake skincare products on TikTok Shop or Amazon. “Everything from [TikTok Shop] seems to be authentic,” she says.\n\nFrancesca, a 14-year-old influencer whose mother said only her daughter’s first name could be used, said she tries to “do research” before buying products on TikTok Shop. To be safe, she says she prefers to buy from “blue check” sellers—ones whose identity has been validated by TikTok. Although she thinks TikTok Shop is “really cool,” she prefers to shop on Amazon for skincare products because she believes the products sold there are more reliable. “I trust buying on Amazon,” she said.\n\nAmazon's big role in the influencer economy\n\nMany influencers across social media use Amazon’s Storefronts to earn commissions from sales of the products they endorse. Anyone with an Instagram, TikTok, YouTube or Facebook account can apply to join Amazon’s Influencer Program, choose which Amazon products to promote, and link to their Amazon Storefronts across the internet. Some of the biggest influencers say Amazon pays them more than $10,000 monthly in commissions.\n\nBut critics have said Amazon is filled with fake products. Sally Olivia Kim, an influencer who sells two varieties of her collagen supplement brand Crushed Tonic on Amazon, worries minors lack the sophistication to identify fake products and may deliberately seek out discounted ones that are more likely to be counterfeit. “Dupe culture has enabled young girls to buy knockoffs,” she says, using a slang term for counterfeits, adding ”people don't understand how bad that really can be.”\n\nPrudence Millsap, a founder of skincare brand Beauty by Earth, which sells its products through sites including Amazon, Target, and Walmart, says one change Amazon could make so that users are better informed is to require that sellers make their products’ country of origin more visible to shoppers. She notes that her company pays a premium to manufacture its products within FDA guidelines, and that competitor brands manufactured in places like China, and sold on Amazon at discounted prices, generally don’t meet the same standards. She thinks this is a safety issue for all consumers, especially young ones.\n\nWhen it comes to teen skincare, an Amazon spokesperson told Fortune, “We are proud to offer a vast selection of skincare products suitable for a variety of ages and skincare needs, but products purchased for younger skin should always first be discussed with a dermatologist or skincare professional.” Amazon, however, does not appear to make such a public warning to its users in either its Help Center or on product pages for popular cosmetics with active ingredients that dermatologists have flagged for their potential harm to children. The company did not respond to a request for comment about the topic.\n\nUsers under 18 are permitted to shop on Amazon only with a parent or guardian. However, children can get around the rule by having an adult’s credit card linked in their accounts.\n\nIn terms of sales, Amazon prohibits anyone under 18 from operating Amazon Storefronts. The company does let children host Storefronts as long as they are managed by a parent or agent, though it’s unclear how this policy is enforced. One 12-year-old girl YouTuber who goes by Noelle Kate with nearly 200,000 subscribers receives a commission when shoppers purchase her “skincare favs,” including a Drunk Elephant serum with glycolic acid, the same ingredient that dermatologist Houshmand says can give kids non-allergic rashes. It’s unclear how many of Kate’s customers are children. She did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment.\n\nA call for legislation\n\nAmazon says it has a zero tolerance policy for counterfeits. It says it withholds commissions, dumps inventory, and bar sellers from the platform who are caught selling counterfeits. In 2023, Amazon invested more than $1.2 billion and employed over 15,000 people to protect the company from “counterfeit, fraud and other forms of abuse,” an Amazon spokesperson says.\n\nAnd still, children continue to be harmed by skincare products. Critics argue that legislation is needed to rein in the sale of beauty products on Amazon, TikTok and on social media at-large. “The beauty, health and wellness industry is not being regulated at all,” says Sheilagh Maguiness, president of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, who also notes that the European Union has banned hundreds of ingredients from personal care products while the U.S. has only banned eight. “Given the absence of regulation in health, wellness and beauty, if companies are seeing an uptick in sales among younger patients with more sensitive skin, there really should be a call for making sure the product is appropriately labeled for its intended use.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Unstoppable AI Stocks Not Named Nvidia That You Can Buy and Hold for Years",
        "content": "Nvidia is undoubtedly the name many investors think about these days when they think of artificial intelligence (AI). And that's not wrong, as the chipmaker has been playing a big role in helping companies develop AI models and improve their overall capabilities. But there are some strong AI stocks to buy besides Nvidia that investors should consider as well.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are three stocks that all look unstoppable right now and can be excellent long-term options for AI investors. Let's find out a bit more about these three buy-and-hold AI stocks.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir is a name that has been growing in popularity with both government organizations and private businesses. The company's focus on data analytics and delivering actionable insights has always had AI connections. But more recently, Palantir made the connection more clear when it launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP. Based on customers' reactions, it's clear they are eager to put it to use.\n\nIn 2023, the company reported revenue totaling $2.2 billion, which grew 17% year over year. For the current year, Palantir anticipates its top line will total around $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, rising at a slightly higher rate of around 20%. It also expects to remain in the black, as it has in recent quarters, as a lack of profitability is no longer a big risk with the tech stock.\n\nPalantir expects its growth rate to ramp up, however, thanks in large part to the more than 500 \"boot camps\" it has held with customers to help them identify possible opportunities for AI to help their businesses. Securing those types of contracts can take time, but with a few large wins, the company's revenue potentially could come in much higher in the long run.\n\nInvestors expect more growth from the business thanks to AI, but Palantir is getting more positive attention because it is not only improving its growth rate but is profitable while doing so. All in all, this can be one of the best AI stocks to own as Palantir's mix of government and commercial revenue gives it some excellent long-term stability.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon was a top AI stock to own even before AI was a big buzzword in stocks. The company has long used AI to optimize its e-commerce operations and shorten its delivery times. While it's a big name in e-commerce, its other business segments are getting a boost from increased interest in generative AI. Amazon has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, which last month rolled out Claude 3, an AI chatbot that could rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether or not Claude 3 becomes the best chatbot isn't what matters in the end. Instead, it's Amazon's constant pursuit of investing in AI and next-generation technologies that makes it a great option for long-term investors. Chatbots are just one of several AI-related growth opportunities for Amazon, especially with its strong cloud business Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe company's deep pockets also put it in excellent shape to continue growing and investing in AI. Last year, Amazon generated free cash flow totaling $32.2 billion as it focused on efficiency and cutting down on costs.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAnother stock poised for growth because of AI is Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. It, too, has entered the chatbot wars with the launch of Bard (recently upgraded and renamed Gemini). Google's rollout, however, hasn't been without its challenges as its chatbots have faced problems with delivering correct and accurate results. But that shouldn't deter investors; just because the launch doesn't go well doesn't mean the long-term outlook is in trouble.\n\nAlphabet has a wealth of data at its disposal through search queries on YouTube and Google, which give it a big advantage in developing a chatbot that may end up being more intuitive and predictive in knowing what people may search for and ask questions about.\n\nThe company's financials are also arguably the best of all three stocks here as Alphabet generates strong margins; last year its free cash flow came in at just under $70 billion. With a wealth of data and cash, Alphabet is a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime subscription service hit a new high of 180 million US shoppers in March, an increase of 8% from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which has tracked Amazon memberships since 2014.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel US Two-Year Yield Hits 5% After Powell’s Remarks: Markets Wrap Beyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI IMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning Debt Iran’s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on Edge\n\nThe increase shows Amazon’s promise of fast delivery on a wide assortment of goods continues to have strong appeal with shoppers grappling with inflation despite greater online competition from Walmart Inc. and China-linked companies such as TikTok Shop, Shein and Temu.\n\nUS consumers pay Amazon $140 a year or $15 per month for Prime subscription, which includes shipping discounts and the ad-supported Prime Video streaming service.\n\nPrime membership growth flattened after the pandemic, and Consumer Intelligence Research Partners last year predicted the online retailer had hit a plateau.

        "title": "Ground Floor Investing: 3 Stocks to Snag Before At-Home Robots Go Mainstream",
        "content": "We may be far from the at-home robotics revolution the Jetsons promised, but there’s still plenty of innovation brewing beneath the surface. While headlines often declare the imminent replacement of workers by AI-enabled robots, reality presents a more optimistic scenario. As the quality of our lives and the dollar value of our labor rise, we’re likely to keep outsourcing greater aspects of our at-home lives to autonomous or robotics systems.\n\nHowever, one issue for retail investors is that many of the most groundbreaking companies remain private, limiting public investment opportunities. This inaccessibility makes investing in the top future robotics firms challenging, although ETFs like Cathie Wood’s ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) can somewhat mitigate this gap.\n\nIf you prefer not to automate your investment in robotics stocks through ETFs, these three companies stand out as top contenders among robotics stocks, targeting a future at-home market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is a robotics stock selling picks and shovels to at-home robotics makers via a range of sensing and communications tech and tools. Most interestingly, the company sells autonomous robot base models to industries adapting to workplace robotics but that lack off-the-shelf options elsewhere. In other words, Zebra is selling robotics platforms easily tweaked, changed and adapted to specific needs — exactly what the future of at-home robotics promises.\n\nUnlike many robotics stocks, Zebra is profitable and stable, though mostly due to its wide-ranging revenue streams, including printing, scanning, computing and software tech. Still, diverse revenue streams mean that Zebra can afford to pump cash into its burgeoning robotics section with fewer risks of losing the operation to a robotics money pit.\n\nThe company’s end-of-year report affirms its overall strength, as the robotics stock hit $296 million in net income at a 6.5% margin — not bad, all things considered. Still, the report was a miss and investors were disappointed. Shares dipped slightly, but not drastically, as many recognize Zebra’s long-term robotics potential. But that doesn’t mean it’s too late to ride this bandwagon into the at-home robotics future.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDA:IRBT) is an easy pick for at-home robotics stocks, but not for the reasons you may immediately think of. Don’t buy iRobot stock for its range of autonomous vacuum cleaners (as useful as they may be). Instead, buy iRobot stock for its deep portfolio of advanced patented tech and the opportunities available for third-party licensing. After all, that’s what drove Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) ill-fated acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust look at Amazon’s existing patent, uncovered early in the company’s iRobot foray, for “An autonomously motile device [that] may be capable of moving or performing other actions within an environment.” Sounds like an Amazon Alexa-meets-iRobot vacuum, doesn’t it? There’s little doubt in my mind that Amazon’s attempted acquisition was an attempt to buy iRobot’s underlying tech for $1.7 billion rather than develop systems in-house. And, just because Amazon’s acquisition is on the outs doesn’t mean iRobot’s underlying tech and patent portfolio is useless – additional acquisition and licensing opportunities abound. Likewise, trading at just 0.3x sales, this robotics stock is just too cheap to ignore.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Zebra Technologies, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) makes and integrates the underlying infrastructure that robotics systems need to operate in your home. In this case, rather than advanced sensing tech, Samsara works extensively within the growing Internet of Things sector, as the company’s IOT ticker implies. The Internet of Things broadly describes an interconnected network of physical objects and the underlying means of communication between them. In a nutshell, Samsara’s tech applied to at-home automation could basically act as the invisible ecosystem tying a range of robots together and keeping the entire operation running smoothly.\n\nSamsara is already testing and deploying that tech, albeit at a much larger scale. The company’s current efforts focus on fleet vehicle management and safety, movement tracking, heavy equipment operations and similarly behind-the-scenes but impactful workflows.\n\nSamsara hasn’t quite nailed profitability yet, but that shouldn’t stop early investors interested in robotics stocks. The company’s most recent report included a 39% annual recurring revenue increase and a 20% improvement to its overall adjusted free cash flow margin – not bad, especially considering management expects to nail positive non-GAAP earnings this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Adobe ADBE recently announced the general availability of its new Acrobat AI assistant tool to all Acrobat and Reader users.\r\n\r\nThis generative AI-powered tool enhances efficiency in PDF, Word, PowerPoint and meeting transcripts by allowing users to ask natural language questions, receive conversational responses and recommend questions based on the PDF’s content.\r\n\r\nThe tool boasts a search feature to highlight key points from a lengthy document. It also acts as a PDF summarizer, offering short overviews for a quick understanding of the content.\r\n\r\nThe latest move will allow Adobe to strengthen its foothold in the global intelligent document processing market, presenting a significant growth opportunity for the company. Per a Grand View Research report, the intelligent document processing market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 30.1% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nStiff Competition\n\nThe latest move is likely to aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to strengthen its competitive position against peers like Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, which are also making concerted efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the intelligent document processing market space.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nRecently, Alphabet announced the general availability of Document AI Custom Extractor to all Google Cloud users.\r\n\r\nThe Custom Extractor utilizes Google's foundation models to efficiently extract data from structured and unstructured documents, enabling faster and more efficient generative AI implementation in document processing workflows.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is gaining from strong momentum across its Azure AI Document Intelligence tool.\r\n\r\nThe new feature updates of this tool include figure detection and hierarchical document structure analysis and improved AI quality for field extraction. The new update also supports cell, row, and table-level confidence scores and overlapping field extraction.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is benefiting from its intelligent document processing solution, Amazon Textract.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Amazon introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called AnalyzeDocument Layout for Textract, which allows customers to automatically extract layout elements like paragraphs, titles, subtitles, headers and footers from documents. This feature extends word and line detection, enabling easier extraction of information in titles, headers and paragraphs, which is crucial for document processing and understanding solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nADBE’s Generative AI Strength to Aid Growth\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Adobe’s growing efforts to strengthen its generative AI capabilities, which are presently acting as a key growth catalyst for the company.\r\n\r\nThe company collaborated with researchers at the University of California and Carnegie Mellon to introduce Project Music GenAI Control, a platform that allows users to generate audio from text descriptions or reference melodies. The tool uses generative AI to assist users in creating and editing music without professional experience. Users can input text descriptions, customize music and remix clips, making it ideal for content creators.\r\n\r\nAdobe recently introduced generative AI innovations in Adobe Premiere Pro, reimagining video creation and production workflows. These tools will streamline editing, including adding or removing objects, and will be powered by a new video model, joining the Firefly family of models. These models will be integrated across Creative Cloud and Adobe Express.\r\n\r\nThe company also announced major product innovations at the Adobe Summit, enabling brands to optimize their content supply chain with its generative AI-first offering, Adobe GenStudio. This new generative AI tool will help marketing teams plan, create, manage, activate and measure on-brand content, addressing the growing demand for personalized and engaging content.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will aid the company in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the global generative AI market. Per a Grand View Research report, the generative AI market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 36.5% between 2024 and 2030.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in the promising generative AI market will, in turn, aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 total revenues stands at $21.42 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.4%.\r\n\r\nHowever, high acquisition expenses remain a major concern for the company. Its shares have lost 21.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 11.1%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Penny Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "The penny stock sector, characterized by its volatility, often undergoes rapid surges and declines due to factors like low volume, cheap pricing, and operational dynamics. Still, for well-informed investors, certain penny stocks present opportunities to achieve substantial gains at low costs. This backdrop forms my list of penny stocks to buy now.\n\nRecent trends indicate a high probability of consecutive rate cuts in 2024, and lower rates tend to kickstart boom cycles for penny stocks. With rates projected to stay around the low 5% range for the rest of 2024 before dropping to the high 4s next year, compared to the current rate of 5.5%, even modest improvements could send penny stock segments surging.\n\nSo here are seven penny stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDestination XL Group (DXLG) Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nDestination XL Group (NASDAQ:DXLG) is unique among penny stocks because, unlike so many unprofitable or speculative firms, Destination XL Group is a longstanding retailer with a proven business model and operational success. The company, which sells “big and tall” men’s clothing, saw sales slump slightly throughout 2023 – but not enough to justify current valuation levels.\n\nA few weeks ago, Destination XL posted fourth-quarter and end-of-year results that saw the company’s adjusted earnings hit $0.10 per share for the quarter and $.50 for the year. While respectable, considering 2023’s retail shopping fluctuations, it also marked a 16% and 20% drop from the prior period, respectively. Still, the company’s 10.7% EBITDA margin is nothing to sneeze at – though Wall Street seemingly thought otherwise, as shares dipped about 10% after the report.\n\nThat represents a slim 6x price-to-earnings ratio and, better yet, a share price of just 0.42x sales. Likewise, the company’s quality cash management (it carries no debt) lets management keep buybacks high. Destination XL’s total yield is 12.52% – in other words, all things considered, this makes it one of those penny stocks to buy now.\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (CXNA) Stacks of pennies representing penny stocks. Nano-Cap Penny Stocks\n\nSource: John Brueske / Shutterstock.com\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (NASDAQ:CNXA) is a unique penny stock capitalizing on emerging sports trends. More specifically, the company’s proprietary Slinger Bag targets unique intersections of sports popularity and region-specific trends by selling custom equipment for pickleball (increasingly popular in the US), padel (a Mexican racket sport), and perennially popular tennis. These niche verticals are unique enough to target directly through quality ad campaigning but popular and widespread enough to ensure product longevity and market growth. This sets Connexa up as a serious growth penny stock to capture renewed outdoor sports enthusiasm as we move into the spring and summer months.\n\nStory continues\n\nConnexa came under fire from short sellers throughout 2023, pushing per-share pricing down more than 70% and forcing a reverse stock split. Despite this, new strategic investors stepped up to the pitch to save Connexa Sports Technologies – and shares of the stock surged more than 500% in the past month in reaction. In other words, there’s a lot of momentum behind this penny stock’s prospects.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) A concept image of a penny sitting on a stock chart\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nI looked at The Metals Company (NASDAQ:TMC) briefly last week, primarily from the perspective that recent Congressional legislation could be a boon to the deep-sea metals mining company. But renewed institutional interest in sourcing valuable metals and minerals (necessary for pretty much all of today’s tech) from the ocean isn’t the only thing keeping this penny stock afloat.\n\nThe company recently brought a new board member, Steve Jurvetson, to the team as Vice Chairman and “special advisor” to the CEO. Jurvetson’s background includes early investments or board positions with SpaceX, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Planet Labs (NYSE:PL), and more. While I’m averse to hinging company hopes on a solo savior, Jurvetson’s background in helping develop small, speculative, untested companies’ full potential could be game-changing for the deep sea mining penny stock.\n\nOne of the company’s current sticking points is its cash position—sea mining exploration is a costly endeavor that takes time to bear fruit (if it does at all). The Metals Company has enough cash and credit liquidity to last another year or so at current spending levels. Still, look for imminent strategic investment developments on the horizon, as I think a major benefit to Juvetson’s board appointment will include his Silicon Valley connections to ready capital and deep pockets.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Energy Storage. battery stocks\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) remains somewhat of a dark horse among penny stocks. The company (and shareholders) endured significant hardships in 2023, with ongoing bearish sentiment keeping its shares low. Critics highlight issues such as decelerating installation rates, liquidity concerns, and challenges competing with Tesla’s expansive charging network—each a valid criticism. But shifting economic winds, including interest rate cut expectations, could prove to be what the penny stock needs to secure a rebound.\n\nChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer has characterized the recent quarters as a “wait and see” period rather than a full-blown operational decline. Looking ahead to 2024, he commented, “It’s getting better, as we’re getting more and more data around the economy, and it appears we’re heading for a soft landing.”\n\nCompeting in electrical charger installation, especially against a behemoth like Tesla that offsets costs through car sales, is an expensive venture. Still, renewed EV sales and possible rate cuts could open up new liquidity opportunities for ChargePoint and kickstart the company’s expansion. This makes it one of those penny stocks to buy now.\n\nDesktop Metal (DM) Page of newspaper with words penny stocks. Undervalued Penny Stocks\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock.com\n\nDesktop Metal Inc (NYSE:DM) is on a run recently as the 3D-printing stock popped more than 30% since January 1st. Though trading well below past highs, the penny stock is set to expand its horizons beyond the basics by targeting new audience segments with rich growth potential.\n\nRecently, Desktop Metal’s healthcare-focused subsidiary, Desktop Health, launched an extensive initiative named ScanUp, targeting dental professionals to transition their practices into the digital age. Given that “half of the dentists in the United States have not yet adopted intraoral scanning,” this foundational step towards dental digitization opens a large, untapped market for Desktop Metal. The ScanUp platform, requiring an initial 36-month commitment, promises to generate more predictable, recurring revenue.\n\nEnding 2023, Desktop Metals significantly reduced its net loss to $323.4 million from $740.3 million in 2022. While it is still progressing toward profitability, Desktop Metal remains a high-risk but potentially high-reward investment opportunity as a penny stock within the growing 3D-printing sector.\n\nRumble (RUM) 7 Stocks to Buy That Save You Money\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) shares have soared nearly 50% since January 1st, setting it apart as a high-momentum penny stock in a relatively stagnant social media sector. The surge in shares comes partly from the company’s provisional offer to acquire TikTok. Still, Rumble’s standing as a top video-centric social media stock isn’t solely dependent on the success of this acquisition. Demonstrating an acute understanding of user preferences, Rumble has partnered with Barstool Sports to provide “access to all Barstool Sports content…including live streams.”\n\nHistorically catering to right-of-center users, Rumble’s attempt to buy TikTok and its partnership with Barstool Sports indicate a strategic push to attract a broader audience. This move seems to be paying off. The company’s end-of-year report highlights include revenue more than doubling since 2022 to $81 million and a 16% pop in monthly active users – the relative disparity means that advertisers see Rumble’s core constituency as worth targeting, and sales should spike further as Rumble’s attempt to spread its wings bears out.\n\niRobot (IRBT) IRBT short-squeeze stocks\n\nAlthough its per-share price of about $8 appears to exclude it from penny stock status, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has a market cap of $229 million, smaller than several stocks on our list, including Desktop Metal and The Metals Company. Despite its small size, iRobot is poised as a possible comeback story of the year. Should circumstances shift in its favor, it could generate unstoppable momentum for this robotics stock, regardless of broader market conditions.\n\nThe failed acquisition Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition’s value thesis centered around iRobot’s robust patent and intellectual property portfolio. Despite a recent slowdown in robotic vacuum sales, its advanced technology continues to attract potential acquirers and investors. With the robotics sector experiencing a renaissance, iRobot stands as one of the few household names well-positioned to capture significant attention from both institutional and retail investors as this trend unfolds.\n\nEven without relying on merger and acquisition prospects, iRobot’s future isn’t bleak. Although sales are currently sluggish, the company is actively right-sizing its operations, aligning with the “survive or die” theme prevalent among small-cap stocks. It recently achieved a 26% improvement in per-share earnings. Despite this boost, iRobot’s stock trades at just 0.37x sales, presenting it as a unique value opportunity with substantial growth potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "According to Investopedia, “Momentum investing is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are rising and sell them when they look to have peaked.” Typically, momentum investors also use stop-loss orders to quickly sell stocks that fall significantly.\n\nAmong the advantages of momentum trading is the ability to make profits very quickly and to benefit from most of the Street’s tendency to keep buying winning stocks. On the other hand, momentum investors can be badly hurt by sudden, unexpected bad news about a company. Other pitfalls include buying stocks early, before momentum has really taken hold, or late, after saturation has been reached. So momentum investing is a difficult art, but it can also be lucrative. For investors who want to utilize this technique, here are three top-notch momentum stocks to buy.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBetween April 1 and April 11, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock jumped over 20%. The shares fell 4.4% on April 12 and tumbled 9.5% on April 15 as the stock market in general and small-cap stocks in particular fell sharply. But given the large, prior uptrend of the shares, I believe that they still have momentum. Moreover, because of two recent events, I think that a significant number of investors on the Street have finally become excited about the firm’s strong outlook.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst, BB reported impressive Q4 results as its revenue climbed nearly 15% versus the same period a year earlier to $173 million. Meanwhile, its EBITDA came in at $21 million. In Q4 of the previous year, it generated an EBITDA loss of $12 million. Also importantly, the sales of its Internet of Things unit jumped 25% year-over-year to an all-time record of $66 million. And, the backlog of its rapidly proliferating QNX operating system came in at a huge $815 million.\n\nSecondly, on April 9, BlackBerry announced that it was collaborating with a leading chip maker, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), to combine the QNX operating system and hardware from AMD into an operating system for robotics. Given AMD’s top-notch reputation and QNX’s high level of IT security, along with the fact that robots are rapidly proliferating, the initiative should generate needle-moving revenue for BB over the longer term.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn March 27, investment bank BTIG predicted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock could rise above $200. The bank stated that “Since 2000, April is AMZN’s best month, averaging +9.87% gain and up 18 vs. down 5 times.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, the bank’s call has been on target, as AMZN stock rose about 3% from March 27 to April 12. To reach BTIG’s goal, however, the shares will have to climb another 8%. What’s more, we’re only halfway through April. In light of these points, I believe that the shares are likely to climb much further in the next two weeks.\n\nAlso positive for the stock’s near-term performance are upbeat comments made by CEO Andy Jassy about AWS, the firm’s cloud business that accounts for the lion’s share of its profits. Specifically, Jassy noted that, as of the end of last year, companies had become more willing to shell out funds on AWS’ offerings.\n\nWisdom Tree India Earnings Fund (EPI) a picture taken in India during the day\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFrom March 19 to April 10, the WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSEArca:EPI) climbed 6.5%. Until April 11, when the stock market fell sharply and ESI stock gave back 1.3%, the shares had gone nearly straight up. Given the stock’s performance in recent weeks, I expect it to continue advancing for at least the next few weeks.\n\nEPI’s rally comes amid continued optimism about the Indian ec0nomy. Economists continue to expect it to grow a great deal as many American companies move more of their supply chains to the country.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Confederation of Indian Industry recently estimated that the nation’s GDP could consistently grow 8%-9% in the coming years. Meanwhile, Bloomberg recently suggested that India could overtake China to become the world’s second-largest economy by 2028.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in BB,AMZN, and EPI.

        "content": "Investors try to pick winning stocks that can put up strong returns over long periods of time. In the past couple of decades, the tech and internet sectors have been a hotbed for these opportunities.\n\nJust look at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Since its initial public offering in May 1997, the e-commerce and cloud computing giant has posted a remarkable return of 190,000%. This would have turned a $1,000 cash investment into a whopping $1.9 million today. An equal investment in either the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite index would've resulted in a much smaller gain.\n\nLet's look back at this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's path to becoming one of the most dominant enterprises on the planet, as well as some important factors when contemplating whether Amazon is worthy of your investment dollars today.\n\nAmazon's unbelievable ascent\n\nJeff Bezos founded Amazon in Seattle in 1994 with the sole intention of figuring out how to sell books online. The business hit the public markets just three years later. In 1997, Amazon generated just $148 million of revenue. Its market cap at the end of that year was $1.4 billion.\n\nFast-forward 27 years, and this business has proven to be one of the most prominent success stories in corporate America. In 2023, Amazon raked in a jaw-dropping $575 billion in revenue. And the company is worth $1.9 trillion.\n\nBut how did this business expand so much over the years to get to this point? The credit goes to Bezos and his executive team.\n\nAmazon transitioned from selling just books online to selling millions of items in what seems to be an unlimited number of different product categories. The website is so popular that it drew 4.3 billion visitors in March. According to Statista, 38% of all online spending in the U.S. goes through Amazon.\n\nThe business has invested heavily on building its logistics infrastructure over the years, now being able to provide fast and free shipping in a cost-effective manner rivals can't compete with. Consequently, Amazon has become a platform for other direct-to-consumer companies to build upon and grow their own operations.\n\nThis strategy of turning what was initially a huge cost center into a revenue driver also applies to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This industry-leading cloud computing platform handled the data and technological needs of the company's burgeoning e-commerce operation. Then Bezos and his team realized that maybe there were other entities that would value this type of back-end on-demand infrastructure.\n\nLast year, AWS recorded $91 billion of annual revenue and $25 billion of operating income. And its customer list includes large companies like Capital One Financial, Toyota Motor, and State Farm.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides online shopping and the cloud, Amazon has one of the top streaming services on the market with Prime Video. And the business generated $47 billion of digital ad revenue in 2023, putting it behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms in the U.S. This impressive track record makes one wonder what's next in store for Amazon.\n\nShould you buy Amazon stock?\n\nBased strictly on the company's scale, as demonstrated by revenue base and current market cap, it's reasonable to assume that Amazon won't put up anything close to the returns it has historically. There simply aren't growth opportunities big enough to significantly move the needle for this colossal enterprise.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should avoid the stock, though. It trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.4. That's more than double the valuation Amazon sold for around the start of 2023. But I think investors should still consider buying shares.\n\nThe current P/S multiple is slightly more expensive than the stock's trailing-10-year average. For that price, investors would gain exposure to a business that is a leader in multiple industries and that has a major player in the AI wars with AWS. Amazon shares might still be able to provide a boost for your portfolio in the years ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best machine learning stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the machine learning industry, go directly to the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably. However, that is not the case as machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data, make predictions, and automate tasks without explicit programming. On the other hand, artificial intelligence includes a broader range of techniques that aim to create systems capable of human-like intelligence, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global AI market was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2023 and 2032, reaching $2.575 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Precedence Research estimated machine learning's market value at $38.11 billion in 2022 and expects it to reach $771.38 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 35.09% over the projected period, between 2023 and 2032.\n\nCompanies Leveraging Machine Learning\n\nWhile there are a handful of companies that are actively working on developing products toward the advancement of machine learning, there are many companies that depend on machine learning technology to run their operations. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) leverages machine learning to influence content creation decisions and personalize the user interface. Moreover, the company’s recommendation system uses ML to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions. Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to deliver tailored content experiences to its subscribers drives user retention and platform growth. The company made the following comments in one of its articles:\n\n“At Netflix, the Machine Learning Platform (MLP) team has been investing in research to push the boundaries of ML Performance over the years. Our state-of-the-art ML performance infrastructure serves as a strong foundation to leverage the latest research in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Infrastructure, GPU Memory Management, Graph Neural Networks, and more recently Large Language Models. We are building an increasingly active engagement with Academia and have a quickly growing graduate ML Internship program that brings us both new talent & the latest research, providing a bridge between university labs and fast-growing industry applications.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial services institution, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been using AI/ML for over a decade. In the company’s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon said that the company now has over 2,000 AI/ML experts and data scientists. Dimon considers AI an “extraordinary” technology and believes that it is “as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years” such as electricity and the internet. He said:\n\n“We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.”\n\nHe further added that the organization understands the importance of AI and for that reason, it has created a new position, chief data and analytics officer.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia in the AI Space\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the markets by storm and was the top-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2023, gaining nearly 240%. The surge was attributed to limited competition in the AI accelerator market. However, other companies have been making strides to take over NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). On April 9, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled its new AI chip, Gaudi 3. According to the company, the chip is “purpose-built for high-performance, high-efficiency GenAI compute”. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that compared to NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100, Gaudi 3 is much more power-efficient and faster.\n\nOn April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced its new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), an upgrade to MTIA v1 that was introduced last year. The chip has been designed for Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) in-house AI workloads, and to decrease its dependency on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The new MTIA version more than doubled the compute and memory bandwidth while maintaining a focus on efficiently serving recommendation models. According to the company, MTIA is part of its long-term plan to build a strong and efficient infrastructure for handling its AI tasks.\n\nWith the above information in mind, some of the best machine learning stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\nA researcher studying a machine learning model of a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through internet rankings of AI stocks and ML stocks, including our own, in addition to the holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) to come up with 25 potential ML stocks. We then looked into each company's products and services to further refine our list to include AI companies that are actively working toward the development and advancement of machine learning. We narrowed down our selection to 13 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\n13. Baidu, Inc.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) traded lower alongside Chinese equities as intensifying problems in China weighed on investor sentiment during the period. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently launched its generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”\n\n12.

IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.”\n\n11. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed at $183 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.68% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.65%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.79%.\n\nThe online retailer's stock has climbed by 6.71% in the past month, exceeding the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.91% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.85%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.81, indicating a 161.29% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $142.48 billion, up 11.88% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.08 per share and revenue of $641.45 billion, which would represent changes of +40.69% and +11.6%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Currently, Amazon is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Amazon is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 45.6. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.18.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.62. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.67.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

        "title": "3 Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest has never shied away from making bold investment moves. With the earnings season upon us, we will see a lot of movement in Cathie Wood stocks. The move could be a part of the bigger investment strategy and might set the momentum for the rest of the year. The stock market had been hitting new highs over the past months but then came the hotter-than-expected inflation report and it led to disappointing news.\n\nThe rate cut might be pushed back and stocks could underperform. In uncertain times like this, it is best to follow the steps of someone who knows how to tackle uncertainty. Cathie Wood has managed to handle the inflation well and her overall investment approach is about buying in periods of decline and then selling high.\n\nThe tech sector has been on a high since the beginning of 2024 and tech stocks are hot picks right now. Ark Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) has been loading up on these stocks for the upside potential driven by Artificial Intelligence. With that in mind, let’s take a look at three Cathie Wood stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SOFI logo\n\nSource: SoFi.com\n\nCathie Wood is someone who often goes bargain hunting and she has loaded up on SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock. The Ark Innovation ETF recently bought 1.67 million SOFI shares and Ark Fintech Innovation ETF bought over 235,700 shares.\n\nThe firm’s total holding in SOFI stands at 10.57 million shares, which makes it the 35th largest shareholder in the company. Buying SOFI stock below $10 is a very smart move and could lead to gains in the long term. While it is hard to predict the market, SoFi will pick pace after the interest rate cut.\n\nThe company has impressed investors with strong quarterly results and managed to report its first-ever quarterly profit. While it has yet to report a full-year profit, it is getting there. It will be interesting to see the company’s numbers in the upcoming results.\n\nSoFi boasts of steady product growth and user growth, which leads to strong revenue numbers. Despite the strong results, SOFI stock is down 24% year-to-date and is trading for $7 today. It shows that investors aren’t very confident about the company yet.\n\nThe market is worried about the impact of student loan forgiveness but it is important to remember that the company has a wide umbrella of products and makes money from multiple segments. SoFi could be a long-term winner in the fintech industry with a banking license and strong product growth.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCathie Wood has been highly optimistic about the future of Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and ARK Innovation ETF owns 2.8% of Palantir stock. After making the first Palantir trade in the final quarter of 2020, Cathie Wood has been doubling down on the stock.\n\nHaving bought and sold the stock multiple times, the firm currently has over 10.9 million shares, forming 1.6% of the portfolio. The biggest growth driver for Palantir is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) which has converted many leads into clients. It already holds a strong presence in the government sector and has proved its potential time and again.\n\nWhile the commercial revenue may still be a small percentage of the total business revenue, Palantir ensures steady income each quarter and its press releases about winning new contracts keep catching investor’s attention. In the fourth-quarter, the commercial revenue was up 70% year-over-year.\n\nThe company signed 103 deals in the fourth quarter worth at least $1 million. Palantir enjoys steady revenue growth and will continue to grow as it expands its AI prowess. Cathie Wood scooped up the tech company’s share after the strong fourth-quarter results and lauded the company for its move toward profitability.\n\nWhile many analysts remain skeptical of PLTR’s upside, Cathie Wood has picked up this undervalued stock time and again. Exchanging hands for $22 today, the stock looks undervalued to me. It is a steady stock that will not disappoint. The company has all it takes to succeed in the AI race but investors need to remain patient when it comes to the upside.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a part of both Cathie Wood and Warren Buffet’s investment portfolio. She first purchased the stock in 2016 and has made several trades since then. Currently Cathie Wood holds $9.46 million worth of stock which forms a decent 0.06% of her portfolio. It is one of her top 10 holdings and the firm is highly optimistic about the future of the e-commerce giant.\n\nAmazon is known for innovation and technology and the company could also become a huge player in the space industry. From the humble beginning as a bookseller to reaching the space, Amazon has come a long way. It has become the biggest competitor of SpaceX and Cathie Wood believes the stock is undervalued if you look at the long-term picture.\n\nWhile it is not cheap and is exchanging hands for $186 today, it has a lot of upside potential. The company’s fourth-quarter results were stellar and reported impressive growth in the cloud and advertising segment. It proved that the business can survive an inflationary period and a high-interest environment.\n\nAmazon has ambitious goals and enough cash to keep investing in the business. It ended the year with $36.8 billion in free cash flow which is nothing but impressive. Already at its 52-week high, Amazon stock is set to soar higher. This is one of the best Cathie Wood stocks to add to your portfolio for the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n15% = US$30b ÷ US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAmazon.com's Earnings Growth And 15% ROE\n\nTo start with, Amazon.com's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 16%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 5.7% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Amazon.com's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Amazon.com Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "7 Stable Stocks for 50% Returns by Early 2025",
        "content": "Investors who seek 50% returns in less than 12 months generally will have many choices within stable stocks. The general maxim regarding risk and return applies here: Risky, unstable stocks tend to offer much higher return potential. It logically follows that stability and high returns don’t  often go together. This has led to this list of stable stocks for returns.\n\nThat’s the point of this article. I’ve used a screener tool to identify stocks that have a low beta and are also projected to increase by 50% or more in price.\n\nThe stocks discussed below generally represent more conservative and stable Industries. However, for various reasons, they are also primed to grow rapidly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s take a look at these stable stocks for returns which offer a potent combination of relative stability and high upside. They would make a nice addition to most portfolios.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a supply chain stock worth paying attention to. The company operates a less than truckload (LTL) freight shipping business.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line’s most recent earnings report denotes softness within its sector. In all of 2023 revenues fell by 6.3% while net income fell by 10%. That said, the company began to head in the right direction toward the end of 2023. In the 4th quarter revenues increased very slightly despite a 2% decline in volumes. Thus, like many other firms, Old Dominion Freight Line is capable of passing on the higher prices to customers. It’s one of those stable stocks for returns.\n\nThe company will need to do more given that net income declined by 0.3% in Q4. This screener suggests potential upside well above 50%. Old Dominion Freight Line’s stability is evidenced by a beta of 1.03. The company has fourth quarter momentum on its side and a clear opportunity to continue appreciating in price.\n\nInsulet (PODD) Healthcare business graph data and growth, Medical examination and doctor analyzing medical report network connection on tablet screen. VANI stock\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock.com\n\nInsulet (NASDAQ:PODD) is one of many promising stocks within the burgeoning diabetes management industry. The company develops and sells automated insulin pod delivery systems that are paired with an automated glucose monitor. The market within which insulate operates is expected to essentially double in size between 2023 and 2030. Insulate will not be the only stock worth considering in this sector but it is one which offers relative stability paired with upside.\n\nLet’s quickly look at those metrics that suggest its shares offer that combination. Share prices move essentially in line with the broader stock market based on its beta. Analyst target prices suggest that shares currently valued at $164 could increase by more than $100 in value.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s difficult to find much fault in Insulet as an investment based on 2023 results. Revenues increased by 30% overall in 2023. Those results were even better in the fourth quarter with revenues increasing by nearly 38%.Perhaps even more importantly, Insulet became substantially more profitable last year. In 2022 the company reported $4.6 million in that income. That figure increased to $206.4 million in 2023.\n\nVinFast Auto (VFS) EvCard charging station. EvCard is China's first electric vehicle rental service. As of July 2017, it had around 6,000 cars and 3,000 stations in Shanghai. Chinese EV stocks\n\nSource: abolukbas / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is one of the better positioned companies and stocks on this list. The Vietnamese EV manufacturer represents multiple burgeoning sectors and is well regarded despite current issues affecting the electric vehicle industry overall.\n\nVietnam continues to emerge as a country for global supply chains as the China-U.S. rivalry heats up. The country has become a major export manufacturer and received fast growing foreign direct investment in recent years. It’s part of the reason that VinFast Auto looks better than many of its contemporaries.\n\nIt’s widely expected that the company’s growth will see it through the current downturn that has plagued the EV sector.The company delivered nearly 35,000 vehicles in all of 2023, representing 374% growth. The company also gave guidance that it anticipates that it will deliver more than 100,000 vehicles in 2024. As the EV sector rebounds and those sales continue to increase shares have the potential to more than double and perhaps triple.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant and a stock that many have identified as one having high potential. It’s well established that Alibaba often draws comparisons to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and I think that’s a good place to start.\n\nAmazon is one of the most valuable firms globally with a market cap of roughly $1.8 trillion. Alibaba, on the other hand, carries a market cap of $188 billion. Amazon is expected to produce somewhere in the neighborhood of $640 billion in revenues in 2024. Alibaba is expected to produce approximately $140 billion. Amazon is roughly 10 times as valuable as Alibaba yet only produces approximately 4 to 5 times more sales. Does Amazon deserve a premium for having carved out such a strong business? Yes. Yet it’s also easy to argue that Alibaba deserves more credit.\n\nThe company is also ramping up share buybacks with the intention of increasing share prices.\n\nChinese stocks have been troubled for the past few years but sooner or later Alibaba is going to rebound and produce strong returns.\n\nEnbridge (ENB) Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) Is a pipeline transporter of oil and gas. In other words, it is a midstream energy stock and one worth considering for its stability and upside. The company operates the world’s longest pipeline system with 9,299 miles of pipeline in the U.S. and 8,510 miles of pipeline in Canada.In bridges natural gas pipeline is much more extensive by mileage and moves roughly 20% of all gas consumed in the U.S.\n\nThe company’s stability is evidenced by its most recent earnings report which reaffirmed its 2024 financial guidance. The company is particularly attractive given its position in relation to natural gas. Demand for LNG is high at present. Enbridge recently formed a joint venture in order to supply that high export demand. The JV will connect natural gas resources in the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. The stock also offers a high-yield dividend making it doubly attractive to income investors.\n\nIndie Semiconductor (INDI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIndie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI) Is a chip company focused on the opportunity in the automotive sector.

The terms refer to bunion correction and the correction of metatarsal bones, respectively.\n\nThe company just celebrated a milestone. Its Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System was used on the 100,000th patient. The company increased the number of train doctors for those systems by 20% during 2023. Average revenues For each correction kit sold reached $6,437, a record high. Revenues increased by 32% overall in 2023 and by 25% during the fourth quarter. The company has a clear opportunity to continue selling more of its procedure kits into healthcare systems and training doctors. It’s clear that the returns on increased sales are very high given that a 20% increase in 2023 equated to a 32% increase in revenues.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better EV Stock: Rivian Automotive vs. Nikola Corporation",
        "content": "Rivian(NASDAQ: RIVN) and Nikola(NASDAQ: NKLA) were once two of the market's hottest electric vehicle stocks. Rivian went public in Nov. 2021, and it soared from its IPO price of $78 to a record high of $172.01 a week later. Nikola went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, and the combined company's shares opened at $37.55 on its first trading day before more than doubling to its all-time high of $79.73 a week later.\n\nBut today Rivian's stock trades at about $9 and Nikola's shares are worth less than $1. Nikola even recently proposed a reverse stock split to bring its stock price above the $1 threshold to avoid the risk of the stock getting delisted. Image source: Rivian.\n\nBoth EV companies ran out of juice after they missed their initial production targets, racked up steep losses, and burned through boatloads of cash. But could either of these unloved EV makers recover over the next few years?\n\nThe differences between Rivian and Nikola\n\nRivian currently sells the R1T pickup, the R1S SUV, and a custom electric delivery van for its top investor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It plans to start mass producing its lower-end R2 SUVs in late 2026, then start rolling out its sportier R3 and R3X SUVs in late 2026 or early 2027. It needs to deliver 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon by 2030.\n\nNikola produces battery-powered and hydrogen-powered electric semi trucks. It initially only sold battery-powered trucks (BEVs), but it rolled out its first hydrogen fuel cell trucks (FCEVs) last year. It's also building a network of hydrogen charging stations through a partnership with the EV charging infrastructure company Voltera.\n\nRivian initially attracted a lot of attention because it was backed by Amazon and Ford. Ford subsequently liquidated most of its stake in Rivian, but Amazon remains its biggest backer.\n\nNikola wasn't backed by any comparable tech or auto giants, and it suffered jarring setbacks after its public debut. Its founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was convicted of securities and wire fraud in Oct. 2022, and it temporarily suspended its BEV sales last year after several of its trucks caught on fire. To shore up its liquidity last year, the company diluted its shareholders by roughly doubling its share count so it could raise more cash through secondary stock offerings. Rivian grappled with a few safety-related recalls, but it didn't face as many existential problems as Nikola.\n\nWhich EV maker is producing more vehicles?\n\nWhen Rivian went public, it predicted it would produce 50,000 vehicles in 2022. But it eventually halved that outlook to 25,000 vehicles as it faced supply chain constraints, and it only produced 24,337 vehicles for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, Rivian overcame its supply chain issues and produced 57,232 vehicles. That acceleration was partly driven by its in-house Enduro drive unit, which reduced its production costs and its dependence on third-party components. But in 2024 it only expects to produce about 57,000 vehicles as it grapples with macro headwinds, stiff competition from other EV makers, and a shutdown of its main plant in Illinois for \"several weeks\" to streamline its production and integrate new technologies.\n\nIn 2024, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to rise 11% to $4.9 billion, as it narrows its net loss from $5.4 billion to $4.6 billion. It will remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future, but it aims to achieve a positive gross margin by the fourth quarter of this year. It was still sitting on nearly $10.5 billion in total liquidity at the end of 2023, and its reasonable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8 gives it ample room to raise fresh cash.\n\nBefore Nikola went public, it said it could deliver 600 BEVs in 2021, 1,200 BEVs in 2022, and 3,500 BEVs in 2023. It also planned to deliver 2,000 FCEVs in 2023. But in reality, Nikola didn't deliver a single vehicle in 2021, and only delivered 131 BEVs in 2022. In 2023, it only delivered 114 trucks -- 35 of which were FCEVs.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Nikola's revenue to more than quadruple to $170 million as it narrows its net loss from $966 million to $470 million, but it needs to significantly ramp up its deliveries to hit that target. That could be challenging considering it ended 2023 with just $465 million in unrestricted cash. However, its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8 (which it reduced by doubling its share count) might give it some room to raise fresh cash through new debt offerings.\n\nThe clear winner: Rivian\n\nBoth of the EV stocks look cheap: Rivian and Nikola trade at just two and six times this year's sales, respectively. However, Rivian's higher production rates, clearer roadmap for the future, and stronger balance sheet all make it a much better buy than Nikola, which repeatedly disappointed its investors with its anemic production rates and quality control issues. Amazon's decision to stick with Rivian as its other investors fled also suggests its downside potential is limited.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nikola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nikola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nikola wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Fall of China’s Tech Giant: How Alibaba’s Woes Expose the Perils of Xi’s Crackdown",
        "content": "Back in the last decade, I told anyone who would listen about the great news of Alibaba stock (NASDAQ:BABA). I even bought some shares.\n\nAlibaba was one of China’s three “Cloud Emperors.” Its hyperscaled data centers, like those of Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), were serious threats to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) in the cloud.\n\nNow Alibaba stock is down 60% from 5 years ago and I wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole. It’s a story America and its tech investors should be very glad for.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nChinese dictator Xi Jinping decided that technology was a threat to his regime. He cracked down on the industry in favor of car companies like Nio (NYSE:NIO). A manufacturing workforce is a compliant one. Tech workers ask questions.\n\nSome of Xi’s actions might be applauded by American liberals. Higher taxes, an end to monopoly, and taking responsibility for what’s online are common political demands here. But Xi went further, demanding that technology serve him, not the market and not the people.\n\nThe result was predictable. I would have predicted it if I thought Xi really would kill his economy to retain absolute power. I was wrong. In this case, American conservatives were right.\n\nThe three years since the crackdown haven’t just cost China $1.1 trillion in market cap. They’ve let America lap China’s whole economy. China has missed the AI boom because, like all tech innovations, AI rides on the minds of empowered talent. Freedom is the price of competing in technology. If you want people to think differently you first must allow them to think freely.\n\nMa Comes Back\n\nIn the crackdown, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma was Xi’s bete noir. Once China’s wealthiest man, Ma was driven from the country, eventually taking a position with Tokyo University.\n\nMa still visits China. He’s still a name. The stock jumped just this week after he praised the company’s reorganization. To hide itself from Xi’s wrath, Alibaba is splitting itself into six pieces. But even Alibaba insiders weren’t fooled. CEO Daniel Zhang quit.\n\nMa’s remarks praising management gave Alibaba stock a brief boost. But the stock is flat for 2024, down 26% over the last year. The company is not what it was. Even in e-commerce, Alibaba is being lapped by Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD), whose Temu site offers cheap, customized goods from a network of online sweatshops.\n\nAlibaba is distracted by the government and its internal turmoil. It is missing the entrepreneurship that once made it great. Sales for 2023 were down from 2022. Profit growth has stalled, and the company has missed several profit estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMa wants Alibaba to “grasp the opportunity of AI,” focusing their efforts on customers. Mistakes were made, he says, but Alibaba is now more “simple and agile.”\n\nFine words, but China’s smartest people aren’t fooled. They’re voting against Xi with their feet, taking their talent and money with them.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe gating factor to growth in our time isn’t resources like oil, or simple manufacturing prowess, as it was a century ago.\n\nIt’s people. Trained, empowered, and free minds are the gating factor to growth today. The more talent you can attract, and the more security you can give them, in their work and in their life, the more money you can make.\n\nAlibaba stock can’t deliver that because Xi Jinping won’t let it. American policymakers are fighting a tariff war, seeking to limit China’s access to AI chips. But that isn’t why we’re winning this Cold War.\n\nFreedom is what’s winning this Cold War. Xi won’t allow it, Ma can’t grant it, and Alibaba is stuck as a result.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held LONG positions in AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "content": "You might not be very familiar with PDD (NASDAQ:PDD), but this is the holding company that owns China-based e-commerce platform Pinduoduo. However, there’s more to the story. After considering PDD’s other well-known e-commerce venture, you’ll probably want to minimize your exposure to Pinduoduo stock.\n\nI’m not saying that you shouldn’t invest in PDD or Pinduoduo at all. The important thing is to understand the substantial risks involved. As we’ll discover, one of PDD’s businesses has the potential to be a blockbuster success or, quite possibly, a dismal failure.\n\nThinking About Dip-Buying Pinduoduo Stock? Be Careful!\n\nYou may have noticed that Pinduoduo stock jumped to $150 early this year before sliding to the $120 area. Is this an invitation to a prime dip-buying opportunity? Not necessarily.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSure, PDD has done well with its Pinduoduo e-commerce platform, which the company operates in China. Pinduoduo might be loosely compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the U.S., though Pinduoduo isn’t a massive juggernaut like Amazon is.\n\nHere’s what you need to consider before investing in PDD based on Pinduoduo’s success. PDD also operates the Temu e-commerce platform internationally. Temu is like the Wish.com online-shopping portal. Some people might even debate whether Temu is little more than a re-branded Wish.com.\n\nWhat’s so bad about being similar to Wish.com, though? ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) owns Wish.com, and ContextLogic stock was once a red-hot topic of conversation among meme-stock traders. Surely, a comparison to Wish.com indicates Temu will be a blockbuster success – right?\n\nIt’s Risky to Be on Team Temu\n\nBefore you join Temu’s team, I strongly suggest that you first look at what happened to ContextLogic stock. From top to bottom, it has lost the vast majority of its value.\n\nApparently, being a meme crowd favorite didn’t solve Wish.com’s problems. According to CNBC, Wish.com “was valued at $14 billion at the time of its IPO in 2020″ but is now “being acquired by Singapore’s Qoo10 for $173 million in cash, 99% below its peak price.”\n\nEvidently, the market for ultracheap items might not be as robust as some folks assumed it would be. As Temu spends heavily on advertising, including pricey Super Bowl ads, skeptical investors should wonder whether Temu will follow down the same unfortunate path that Wish.com did.\n\nBear in mind, Temu reportedly spent an estimated $600 million to $1.4 billion on advertisements during 2023’s first nine months. Thus, PDD is taking a big risk on Temu’s success, and so are you, if you’re a shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinduoduo Stock: It’s Not Just a Bet on Pinduoduo\n\nI would encourage you to research both Pinduoduo and Temu, since PDD operates both of those e-commerce businesses. Then, you might have mixed feelings about PDD.\n\nIn addition, consider what happened to Wish.com and ContextLogic stock. If you’re still enthused about buying Pinduoduo stock, be sure to keep your position size very small. That way, you can mitigate your risk against a potential share-price collapse.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With the S&P 500 climbing, extending its gains in this bull market, you may wonder if it's too late to get in on the action. But I've got some good news for you: When you invest over the long term -- at least five years -- you'll find great investing opportunities during any market environment. In investing, time is on your side, offering you the chance to benefit as a company evolves and delivers on various promises from product launches to earnings growth.\n\nToday is a particularly interesting moment to invest in technology as we head for what could be the next revolution in the field: artificial intelligence (AI). Some AI stocks have soared, while others haven't yet gained momentum -- and in both of these areas, you'll find players likely to gain over the long term. That's why if you have $50,000, or even a smaller amount, that you don't need for everyday expenses and want to grow over time, it's a fantastic idea to invest it in a basket of tech stocks that may benefit from the AI boom.\n\nSo now, let's talk about the best stocks to buy right now. The following four all could become AI winners, but they also have solid businesses beyond this technology. So, when you buy them, you aren't betting the farm on just one particular area, and this offers you a fantastic combination of growth and safety. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has soared a mind-boggling 2,200% over the past three years, so you may hesitate to get in on this story now. But this actually could be just the beginning of Supermicro's growth story because we're in the early days of AI development -- and Supermicro can benefit from growth of all of the top AI chipmakers.\n\nThis is because the maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment needed for AI includes chips of these players in its systems -- and it follows their product development closely so that it can immediately make these innovations available to its customers.\n\nSupermicro said recently that it's seeing ongoing record demand for its rack scale solutions for AI including some of these best-selling chips. And new releases, such as the upcoming launch of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture could further boost orders. All of this should translate into ongoing earnings growth well into the future and push the shares higher.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading maker of central processing units, the key component of a computer. But Intel hasn't yet benefited from the excitement surrounding AI. The chipmaker fell behind in the AI space, and that's been one of the elements weighing on its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut things may be about to change for two reasons. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products, including its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator that may even challenge Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's preparing to launch its most powerful chip ever based on the Blackwell architecture as mentioned above -- so I don't expect Intel to beat this market leader. But it doesn't have to. Gaudi 3's performance and affordability could help it carve out enough market share to boost Intel's earnings and eventually share price over time.\n\nAnd Intel's second bit of good news? The company is opening up its manufacturing to others, and this could result in a whole new growth driver as the AI boom continues.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a long track record of earnings growth thanks to its leadership in the high-growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. And this is likely to continue as the company has invested to help it maintain leadership here. In e-commerce, Amazon has revamped its fulfillment network to make deliveries faster, a move that pleases customers and makes Amazon more cost efficient.\n\nAs for cloud computing, AI is set to play a big role in growth moving forward. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is heavily investing to serve the AI customer's every need -- from the basics like chips and software to a fully managed service that allows customers to tailor popular large language models for their own use.\n\nThis should help AWS keep its long-held position as the world's No. 1 cloud computing services provider -- and lift revenue over time. That's particularly good news because AWS historically has been the driver of overall profit at Amazon. And all of this means Amazon stock has plenty of room to run, even after recent gains.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is known for helping most of us on a daily basis. It's the owner of Google Search, the search engine with more than 90% share of the global search market. Alphabet's top business even has managed to enter our language, with people often answering a question with: \"let's Google it.\"\n\nAnd now, Alphabet's investment in AI is likely to further strengthen the company's leadership in the search market. Alphabet recently launched Gemini, it's most advanced AI model yet, and is incorporating AI in all products and services -- including search. The move is making search better and making the advertising process easier, and this should keep advertising revenue climbing. This is key because Alphabet makes most of its revenue through Google advertising.\n\nAlphabet also offers investors a solid track record of earnings growth, and even during the recent difficult economic times, advertising revenue held up pretty well. That makes this company one of the safest AI bets on my list, and a great place to park a portion of your $50,000 today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How Amazon Became the Largest Private EV Charging Operator in the US",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon’s Maple Valley, Washington, warehouse is built for speed. At night, big rigs pull up to one end to unload boxes and padded mailers – some after a short drive from a bigger warehouse down the road, others following a flight in the hold of a cargo plane. Waiting employees scan, sort and load them into rolling racks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Versus Iran — What All-Out War Could Look Like Apple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as Rivals Rise Iran’s Attack on Israel Sparks Race to Avert a Full-Blown War Singapore PM Lee to Hand Reins to Wong After Two Decades Goldman Traders Deliver Surprise Profit Surge\n\nBefore 7 a.m. each day, many of those racks are wheeled out to dozens of vans lined up in four painted lanes. It’s the starting line at a Formula One race, but for $22-an-hour delivery drivers who ferry bottles of shampoo and packs of batteries to suburban Seattle doorsteps.\n\nTheir routes, the last step in a journey that can take products thousands of miles, are the source of a large chunk of the carbon emissions Amazon has pledged to eliminate in the coming decades.\n\nThe solution lies in the parking lot across the street: 309 Siemens electric vehicle chargers, which power delivery vans built by Rivian Automotive Inc. Making deliveries without tailpipe emissions, and increasing the size of the electric fleet, is among the most straightforward ways Amazon can wipe carbon from its operations.\n\nIn a little more than two years, Amazon has installed more than 17,000 chargers at about 120 warehouses around the US, making the retail giant the largest operator of private electrical vehicle charging infrastructure in the country. “We’ve figured out the path,” said Tom Chempananical, who oversees Amazon’s fleet of last-mile delivery vehicles.\n\nLogistics companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. have rolled out their own ambitious electric vehicle targets, though many have failed to meaningfully curb the growing emissions from e-commerce deliveries. Amazon, meanwhile, backed away from a vow to make half of all deliveries with zero carbon pollution by 2030, saying that initiative was superseded by broader climate goals. But the company has come farther and faster in the transition to EVs than most of its competitors. Understanding the challenges faced by Amazon, a company known for going to extreme lengths to meet tight delivery deadlines, can help chart a roadmap for other companies across industries trying to eliminate their own carbon bills.\n\n“Amazon’s scale matters,” said Kellen Schefter, director of transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities that has worked to connect Amazon to power companies. “If Amazon can show that it meets their climate goals while also meeting their package-delivery goals, we can show this all actually works.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has a long way to go. The Seattle-based company says its operations emitted about 71 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, up by almost 40% since Jeff Bezos’s 2019 vow that his company would eventually stop contributing to the emissions warming the planet. Many of Amazon’s emissions come from activities – air freight, ocean shipping, construction, and electronics manufacturing, to name a few – that lack a clear, carbon-free alternative, today or any time soon. The company has not made much progress on decarbonization of long-haul trucking, whose emissions tend to be concentrated in industrial and outlying areas rather than the big cities that served as the backdrop for Amazon’s electric delivery vehicle rollout.\n\nBut Amazon is on track to purchase by next year as much electricity produced by solar, wind and other carbon-free sources as it uses to power its operations. And in Rivian, which Amazon has backed with a massive investment and an order for 100,000 custom-built delivery vans – 13,500 of which have been delivered to date – the company has suggested it can eliminate much of the emissions associated with its last-mile delivery business.\n\nTo get there, Amazon had to learn how to pick up the phone and call the power company. Electric utilities, which to that point primarily dealt with electric vehicles through powering the odd home car charging setup, encountered a new type of customer in Amazon. Government electricity use estimates show a 100,000-square-foot warehouse tucked in an industrial area might be powered by about 50 kilowatts, mainly for lighting and air circulation. Setting up 100 chargers in the parking lot could require 10 to 20 times as much power.\n\n“What was different here was this was a new type of electric use,” said Schefter, of the EEI. “That’s a really big power requirement in a parking lot.” That need could be met relatively quickly if the transmission lines in the area have spare capacity. In areas of the grid that don’t, upgrades can take years.\n\nRead More: 11 Startups Leading the $1.8 Trillion Climate Tech Revolution\n\nAmazon also learned how to be flexible and how to wait. The company prefers cookie-cutter processes that can be run like a production line. That breaks down in the physical world, where Amazon’s hundreds of last-mile delivery warehouses come in different designs or parking lot layouts, subject to differing local utility protocols.\n\n“It was a bit of a surprise, how long we would need to prepare for the lead time for infrastructure,” said Chris Atkins, who leads Amazon’s logistics sustainability teams.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon met with some of the country’s large utilities, who probed the company on how much power it would need and where. Representatives of Commonwealth Edison, Illinois’s largest power provider, were there. The utility, which was struggling to secure some types of new equipment during the pandemic, opted to repurpose old transformers for Amazon. “We were doing some pretty creative stuff internally to make sure that we had what they needed and that we could meet the timelines that they wanted,” said Diana Sharpe, who deals with large customers at the Exelon Corp.-owned company.\n\nBy the time Rivian began rolling out large quantities of vans during the spring of 2022, ComEd had routed additional power to an Amazon warehouse in Chicago’s Pullman neighborhood. Rivian’s CEO stopped by that July for a ribbon cutting to announce the vans were hitting the road. Today, ComEd powers about 1,100 chargers at four Amazon warehouses in greater Chicago.\n\nAnother lesson Amazon learned is one the company isn’t keen to talk about: going green can be expensive, at least initially. Based on the type of chargers Amazon deploys – almost entirely mid-tier chargers called Level 2 in the industry – the hardware likely cost between $50 million and $90 million, according to Bloomberg estimates based on cost estimates supplied by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Factoring in costs beyond the plugs and related hardware -- like digging through a parking lot to lay wires or set up electrical panels and cabinets – could double that sum. Amazon declined to comment on how much it spent on its EV charging push.\n\nIn addition to the expense of the chargers, electric vehicle fleet operators are typically on the hook for utility upgrades. When companies request the sort of increases to electrical capacity that Amazon has – the Maple Valley warehouse has three megawatts of power for its chargers – they tend to pay for them, making the utility whole for work done on behalf of a single customer. Amazon says it pays upgrade costs as determined by utilities, but that in some locations the upgrades fit within the standard service power companies will handle out of their own pocket.\n\nWhen Amazon made the Rivian order, people who worked on the program expected that running an electric delivery fleet would eventually be cheaper than the company’s conventionally fueled fleet, a hodgepodge of bulk-ordered gasoline and diesel vehicles built by the likes of Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Stellantis NV. It’s unclear if Amazon is there yet, though Chempananical said Amazon was happy with the price tag of the Rivian vehicles. “All of those costs continue to scale down,” he said. “As usage grows, there's more demand, there's more supply, it gets more efficient and continues to drive to a better spot.”\n\nAmazon also had to figure out the logistics of charger sharing. That’s not an issue at the Maple Valley warehouse, where 77 electric vans have their pick from among a fleet of 307 level 2 chargers. But other sites have fewer chargers than available vans. Fully charging a van can take several hours, and at first, that created some headaches. Amazon initially required the subcontractors who manage van fleets and drivers to keep their own staff working overnight to rotate vans among available chargers. Last fall Amazon brought that work in house, freeing subcontracted workers to drive, rather than babysit chargers. “They need the drivers, at the end of the day,” Chempananical said.\n\nAmazon’s contract drivers say they love the vans, which were built for the company’s sometimes punishing, package-every-90-seconds routes and frequent stops. The people who employ the drivers – Amazon’s Delivery Service Partners – have some complaints. Two West Coast delivery service providers, who asked for anonymity to protect their relationship with Amazon, said body work can cost two or three times as much as conventional vehicles, because few body shops are authorized to work on Rivian vans. Spare parts can be hard to come by.\n\nTrucking presents a bigger challenge, for Amazon and the industry. Automakers are much farther along in electrifying cars and light-duty trucks than the tractors that haul shipping containers from ports and between warehouses (see Tesla’s semi truck, which is still in pilot production years after being unveiled). Bug-eyed Rivian electric vans are a common sight crisscrossing major cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, New York and their suburbs. But the communities that host the massive warehouses further up the supply chain, often poorer precincts in places like northeast Pennsylvania or California’s Inland Empire, have yet to see the same benefits of electrification. In the company’s post-pandemic cost cutting drives, Amazon has delayed and shelved some trucking-related and other so-called “middle mile” sustainability investments, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAtkins rejected the critique, rattling off moves Amazon has made in the arena: buying trucks that run on compressed natural gas, and investing in makers of green hydrogen, among other fuel sources. “It's important that we get it right and not just scale with the wrong partners,” he said.\n\n“It will get there,” Chempananical said of Amazon’s investments in the “middle mile.” “It’s just a matter of when and how we get there.”\n\nBack at the Maple Valley warehouse, Justin Shearer, who runs Pacific Delivery and Logistics, an Amazon delivery service provider, gives a tour of his corner of the facility. Like many of Amazon’s small army of delivery contractors, he holds another job. Shearer is a commercial fisherman, and earlier in his career he sold mining and logging equipment. He doesn’t consider himself an environmentalist. But the benefits of keeping oil products off the road are obvious, he said.\n\n“Putting this infrastructure in is expensive,” he said. “It's not been done at this scale, but you're not going to get better at it unless you start somewhere.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Cocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the Bean Race for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers Toyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "'Avengers: Endgame' filmmakers add Amazon executive to studio team",
        "content": "By Dawn Chmielewski\n\nLOS ANGELES, April 15 (Reuters) - Joe Russo, co-director of \"Avengers: Endgame,\" found a memorable setting to approach the latest hire for the independent studio he founded with his brother. Russo invited Chris Brearton, an executive at Amazon.com's MGM studio, to join him at the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nOver stops in the Spanish resort town of San Sebastian and a vineyard, and lots of nudging along the way, Brearton agreed to join the independent studio, AGBO, as a partner.\n\n\"The passion that you see around me is what's attracted me to these two,\" said Brearton, referring to Russo and his brother and filmmaking partner, Anthony Russo.\n\nThe Russos met Brearton in 2014, while still in production on the Marvel Studios film \"Captain America: Civil War,\" to seek insights into forming an independent studio. The entertainment industry lawyer shepherded negotiations with AGBO's financier, leading to the formation of the company in 2017.\n\nBearton joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2018 as its chief operating officer, and remained at the home of \"James Bond,\" \"Rocky\" and \"Legally Blonde\" after its sale to Amazon in 2022. He was working in a corporate strategy role for Amazon Prime Video when he received the call from Joe Russo last summer that set him on his path back to AGBO.\n\nThe Russos, who are best known for directing two of the highest grossing movies of all time, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame,\" said they brought in Brearton to add business expertise as they develop stories for contemporary global audiences who consume media in different ways. He will oversee all aspects of the company's business strategy, operations and growth moving forward.\n\nThe studio's fourth partner is Donald Mustard, former chief creative officer at Epic Games and a central figure in the creation of online game Fortnite, joined AGBO in November 2023. Sister and screenwriter Angela Russo-Otstot, who at age 15 co-starred in an early Russo brothers film, \"Pieces,\" serves as AGBO's chief creative officer.\n\n\"What we're putting our energy into is a blurring of the lines between media,\" Joe Russo said. \"Stories are going to become more fluid because of technology and the way that you receive those stories. Form and structure are going to become less important.\" (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; additional reporting by Lisa Richwine Editing by Marguerita Choy)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is in full swing, and Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners thus far. Its chips power the most advanced AI systems, including ChatGPT from OpenAI, and its share price rocketed 230% over the past year. But Goldman Sachs thinks software and services companies could be the biggest beneficiaries in the long run..\n\nSeveral Wall Street billionaires seem to be thinking along the same lines. The hedge fund managers listed below sold down their positions in Nvidia in the fourth quarter and reinvested capital in AI stocks that fit more neatly into the software and cloud services categories.\n\nIsrael Englander at Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%. Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%.\n\nMeanwhile, Englander and Cohen purchased shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) during the fourth quarter, supercharged AI stocks that soared 84% and 170%, respectively, over the past year.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter results that crushed Wall Street's expectations. Sales increased 14% to $170 billion, the third straight quarter in which growth has accelerated sequentially. That was primarily due to momentum in advertising and retail, but cloud computing sales also accelerated from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, GAAP net income improved to $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\nAmazon is set to maintain that momentum given its strong presence in three markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace in the world as measured by monthly visitors, and the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser and the third largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nThat puts Amazon on a glidepath to double-digit sales growth through 2030. I say that because the online retail, digital advertising, and cloud computing markets are projected to grow at annual rates of 8%, 16%, and 14%, respectively, during that period. Indeed, with those tailwinds at its back, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five year.\n\nHowever, Amazon could surprise Wall Street depending on how successfully it monetizes artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in its cloud computing business. The company has designed custom chips for AI training and inference, called Trainium and Inferentia. Those chips cannot outperform Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), but they are more cost effective in certain situations and could bring more business to AWS.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that lets businesses customize large language models and build generative AI applications. Likewise, Amazon Q is a conversational business assistant that leans on generative AI to search and summarize information from various internal and external data sources. The chatbot can also answer questions and automate tasks like writing blogs and social media posts. Collectively, those products could drive faster-than-expected sales growth for Amazon.\n\nShares currently trade at 3.4 times sales, a tolerable valuation if Wall Street's consensus is correct and a more reasonable valuation if the company manages to grow sales faster than 11% annually. Personally, I think Amazon is a worthwhile long-term investment as its current price.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir reported reasonably good financial results in the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 35% to 497 and the average existing customer spent 8% more. In turn, revenue rose 20% to $608 million, reflecting 32% growth in commercial sales and 11% growth in government sales. Non-GAAP net income doubled to reach $0.08 per diluted share.\n\nCEO Alex Karp commented on Palantir's AI ambitions in his annual sharholder letter. \"Every part of our organization is focused on the rollout of our Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has gone from prototype to product in months. And our momentum with AIP is now significantly contributing to new revenue and new customers,\" he wrote. AIP brings support for large language models to Palantir's commercial platform, Foundry.\n\nTo elaborate, Palantir builds software that helps businesses integrate and analyze data, develop and manage machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that improve decision-making. Forrester Research has recognized Palantir's Foundry as a leading AI/ML platform. AIP enhances Foundry, such that clients can develop and utilize generative AI to improve business outcomes. For instance, one of the largest U.S. healthcare organizations is using AIP to generate shift schedules that consider employee preferences, decision costs, and demand predictions.\n\nIn other news, the U.S. Army recently selected Palantir to build its Titan ground station system, which uses AI/ML to rapidly process data received from sensors placed in terrestrial, aerial, high altitude, and extraterrestrial locations. The 24-month contract is valued at $178 million, so it will not significantly move the needle for Palantir, but it does highlight its versatility and the contract could lead to further deals with the U.S. government.\n\nGoing forward, the data analytics market is forecasted to grow at 27% annually through 2030. While I doubt Palantir will match that pace given its past performance and small customer base, the tailwind still has positive implications for the company. Wall Street expects Palantir to grow sales at 21% annually over the next five years.\n\nIn that context, its current valuation of 23.5 time sales looks expensive, especially when the three-year average is 17.8 times sales. Also noteworthy, Palantir currently carries a consensus sell rating among Wall Street analysts, and the stock bears a median price target of $20.50 per share, which implies 10% downside from its current price of $22.80 per share. I would steer clear of Palantir until the stock trade at a more reasonable valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Amazon Stock?",
        "content": "E-commerce and cloud leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a bona fide stock winner that keeps compounding in value. Shares trade near their all-time highs, and a mere $1,000 investment made at its initial public offering in May 1997 has turned into over $1.9 million.\n\nNaturally, new investors will ask whether they have missed the train on this stock. Does Amazon still have share appreciation juice to squeeze as it approaches a $2 trillion valuation? The answer to that question involves asking two other distinct questions:\n\nCan Amazon still grow? Does the stock's valuation leave room for more?\n\nAfter doing some homework, I was surprised at the answers I found. Here is what you need to know.\n\nCan Amazon still grow?\n\nNaturally, growth becomes more challenging when you're a massive corporation generating, in Amazon's case, $574 billion in annual revenue. But borrowing a phrase from my kids, Amazon is built differently.\n\nThat's because Amazon plays in three humungous markets with more room for growth and opportunities than most: e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising. It is America's leading e-commerce company, with a 38% market share. In cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the market with a 31% share. Amazon is expected to account for 15.2% of all digital advertising spending in the U.S. in 2025.\n\nThat leadership helps Amazon compete because it has the size and scale most competitors can't match. It can provide a better product for less money.\n\nThe best part is that these big-picture trends favor Amazon. Today, e-commerce still only accounts for just over 15% of total retail in the United States. That's trillions of dollars of consumer spending yet to move online.\n\nCloud computing has become the foundation of the internet, and now artificial intelligence (AI) has added several new rooms to build up and stack on top. Just recently, Amazon announced $50 billion in new data center investments for Virginia and Japan, underlining how much computing power AI and an increasingly digital world will command. Some believe in a bullish scenario in which public clouds like AWS could become a $10 trillion market over the coming years.\n\nThird, Amazon has amassed a massive presence in the media landscape by leveraging its Prime subscription program, which has somewhere around 200 million paying accounts. Prime members get access to streaming content and Amazon's rights to Thursday Night Football via the National Football League. Additionally, Amazon generates billions in advertising revenue through Prime and through its affiliate sales program. The ad business grew 27% year over year in Q4, faster than any other part of Amazon. Annualizing its Q4 ad revenue puts the segment at nearly $60 billion. Amazon's strong growth rate seems to imply plenty of room for the ad business to expand moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Amazon seems to have plenty of opportunities to continue growing.\n\nDoes the valuation make sense?\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos once said that the company was \"famously unprofitable.\" He meant that you had to look at the business's cash flow because it reinvested all its profits back into the company. In other words, valuing the stock on bottom-line earnings doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nSo I looked at Amazon's ratio of price to cash from operations (CFO) to see if it's still attractive today. After all, shares are trading at all-time highs and have increased 88% over the past year. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nWhat jumps out is how low a valuation the stock came from by nearly doubling in share price in just a year. At less than 20 times operating cash flow, that bargain doesn't come around often. The good news is that shares are still notably below their average valuation over the past decade.\n\nSo yes, shares still offer some value today.\n\nIs it too late to buy Amazon?\n\nWhether to buy any stock depends on what the company could do in the future and the price you pay for that potential growth. You'll likely make money over time if you get those two things right.\n\nAmazon has room to continue growing its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. And it has gotten further into media and advertising, which gives the company a third potential growth avenue to explore.\n\nAs you saw above, Amazon is still (at worst) reasonably priced today.\n\nSo to answer the question, long-term investors can still buy the stock today. It's not too late, despite the strong run over the past year.\n\nWith that said, shares could always dip, as any stock might, so consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to slowly build a position to avoid being caught in a market correction with no money left to invest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Sold Amazon and Microsoft but Bought This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock",
        "content": "Dan Loeb is known as a mover and a shaker in the investing world. He founded the New York-based hedge fund Third Point in 1995. It now has roughly $11.5 billion in assets under management. Loeb's net worth stands at $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe activist investor did some moving and shaking in his hedge fund's portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Loeb reduced his stakes in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). However, the billionaire investor bought another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock.\n\nTaking profits\n\nLoeb sold 210,000 shares of Microsoft in Q4. While this reduced Third Point's stake in the tech giant by over 9.4%, Microsoft remains the second-largest holding in the hedge fund's portfolio.\n\nThe billionaire investor has owned Microsoft off and on since 2006. He most recently initiated a new position in the fourth quarter of 2022, just in time to ride the generative AI wave started by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT. Microsoft was a major beneficiary of this wave thanks to its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThird Point first owned Amazon in late 2019 and held the stock through the second quarter of 2022. Loeb didn't stay on the sidelines long with the e-commerce and cloud services leader. He initiated a new position in Amazon in the second quarter of 2023. Although he reduced Third Point's stake in the stock by nearly 10.3% in Q4 2023, Amazon still ranks as the hedge fund's third-largest holding.\n\nWhy did Loeb trim his positions in Amazon and Microsoft? The most likely reason is he wanted to take some profits. Both stocks delivered impressive gains last year.\n\nA bigger bet on Meta\n\nAlthough Loeb cooled somewhat on two Magnificent Seven stocks, he placed a bigger bet on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The hedge fund manager increased Third Point's stake in Meta by nearly 5.5% in Q4 2023. The $410.6 million value of the position made Meta the sixth-largest holding for Third Point at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoeb's history with Meta goes back to the second quarter of 2016 when he first bought the stock. He owned shares of the social media company for a little over two years before exiting the position. The activist investor again bought Meta stock in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained a position through 2021 Q4. Loeb went back to the well in the third quarter of 2023 with another new stake in Meta.\n\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, Meta enjoyed a generative AI tailwind last year. However, I suspect that wasn't Loeb's primary reason for adding to his position in the stock. Instead, my hunch is that Loeb liked Meta's moves to increase its profitability.\n\nThose efforts are paying off. Meta's earnings more than tripled year over year in 2023 Q4. Full-year profits jumped 69%.\n\nDid Loeb make the right moves?\n\nIn one sense, Loeb went one for three with these Magnificent Seven transactions. Loeb's decision to increase Third Point's stake in Meta is already paying off. Meta stock has skyrocketed over 45% since the end of 2023. However, Amazon and Microsoft are also up by double-digit percentages year to date. Loeb could have made more money by holding his shares in both companies.\n\nHowever, trimming the positions in Amazon and Microsoft could still have been the right call for Loeb. Both stocks make up significant percentages of Third Point's portfolio. You can't blame any investor for wanting to ensure their holdings aren't overly concentrated in a handful of stocks.\n\nOver the long term, I think that Loeb -- and other investors -- will be well served by owning all three of these stocks. Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses should continue to grow robustly thanks largely to AI. I like Meta's focus on business messaging and smart glasses with embedded AI assistants. I predict Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta will remain magnificent for a long time to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Antitrust fervor is gripping Washington and Silicon Valley. But lawsuits have been declining.",
        "content": "US antitrust lawsuits have been falling since the pandemic despite a high-profile legal war pitting Washington against Silicon Valley.\n\nCivil antitrust cases alleging monopolistic mergers or business practices fell 42% between March 2020 and March 2023, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, dropping to 361 from 626.\n\nThe numbers have gotten smaller despite a wide-ranging push during that period by the Biden administration to limit the concentration of power in key industries, including Big Tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). It is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries.\n\nThe number of government antitrust cases filed for the 12-month period ending in March 2023 fell to 9, from 28 in 2020.\n\nThe number of private suits brought by companies alleging unfair competition in their industries fell to 352, down 42% from 2020.\n\nIt is possible that lawsuits rebounded over the last year; the government's figures for the 12-month period ending in March 2024 are not yet available.\n\nA separate analysis from legal analytics company Lex Machina shows a 19% increase for all of 2023. But even Lex Machina said that its figures show a general decline in antitrust filings over the last decade.\n\n\"Since 2015, the trend has been fairly significantly downward,\" said Ron Porter, a data expert with the company.\n\n\"It's a very real trend.\"\n\n'Not easily answered'\n\nWhy the general decline? Legal observers have a number of theories.\n\n\"It's a good question but not easily answered,\" New York University economist Lawrence White said.\n\nPerhaps a stronger enforcement climate is keeping anticompetitive behavior in check, or the government is choosing to go after bigger targets in exchange for fewer cases to save on costs and staffing.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan told Jon Stewart last week on the Daily Show that when confronting big companies her staff sometimes can be “outgunned” on lawyers by as much as 10 to 1.\n\n\"We play to our strengths,\" she said, by being \"strategic\" and \"entrepreneurial.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing a new antitrust suit against Apple in March. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nOther theories to explain the decline in antitrust cases are that companies increasingly view courts as unreceptive to their claims, or fear that the financial risk to take on an antitrust case is too high.\n\nSome antitrust experts attribute the decrease to federal court decisions in a series of cases, including one Supreme Court case in 2004 where it ruled against arguments that Bell Atlantic and other successor companies to the old AT&T engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n\nMore stringent requirements applied by other courts over the years also increased the burdens on private plaintiffs, particularly class-action plaintiffs, according to a 2020 report from attorneys at law firm Simpson Thacher.\n\nThat, according to the report, resulted in reduced frequency of filings and larger and more complex cases.\n\n\"It has to be a really meritorious case with high potential for significant reward,\" said Randy Stutz, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, an organization that advocates for more robust antitrust enforcement by the federal government.\n\nHe suspects that high bar is likely keeping some credible claims from being filed.\n\n\"The value proposition is changing,\" he added.\n\nThe drop in private cases could be a concern for federal antitrust regulators because corporate plaintiffs can provide \"deregulated\" checks and balances that can be overlooked or under-prosecuted by government regulators, University of Michigan Law School professor Daniel Crane said in a 2010 article. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. (Kevin Wurm/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFederal antitrust regulators like the FTC and the Justice Department have \"become more and more dependent on private actions that serve that deterrent function,\" Stutz said.\n\nWhite, who sits on the advisory board of the American Antitrust Institute, disagrees that the decline in lawsuits can be easily attributed to a single cause, like less enforcement power.\n\n\"I'm very sympathetic to much of what AAI does, otherwise I wouldn't be on their board,\" White said. \"But to wring your hands and decry every time there's a decline in lawsuits filed and think that means there's less enforcement, that doesn't follow.\"\n\nThere's no question, White said, that US court decisions have made it harder to bring antitrust lawsuits. But what makes it complicated to pinpoint the exact cause of a case decline, he added, is that government penalties have become steeper for antitrust violations.\n\n\"Fines are steep,\" he said. \"And people go to jail for price fixing.\"\n\n'The system is rigged'\n\nThe calculus to go forward with an antitrust case is even more challenging for businesses that rely on dominant firms in their supply and distribution chains. Those companies, Stutz said, may shy away from antagonizing a critical partner with an antitrust suit.\n\nTo bring an antitrust suit against Amazon as a private plaintiff you would have to hire a \"fancy antitrust lawyer\" and \"a fancy antitrust economist\" and thus \"the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims individually,\" economist expert Hal Singer, managing director of Econ One, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill during an antitrust hearing in February 2021.\n\n\"And so the system is rigged effectively to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least by private complainants.\"\n\nSome recognizable companies, however, have decided to take on that risk over the past year.\n\nThe latest crop of company-initiated cases includes complaints by pharmaceutical giant Regeneron (REGN) against rival Novartis (NVS); publishers Helena World Chronicle and Gannett (GCI) against Google; and a group of pharmacies challenging the actions of Cigna’s pharmacy benefit management organization Express Scripts (CI). Regeneron is among the companies that have decided to bring antitrust suits against other companies. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nCompanies have had mixed results. In two closely watched antitrust cases by popular video game developer Epic Games against Apple and Google over their respective app stores, Epic won its case against Google but mostly lost the case against Apple.\n\nOne private company successfully challenged a merger. The case, brought by door manufacturer Steves & Sons, unwound a tie-up between door and frame manufacturers Jeld-Wen (JELD) and competitor CMI.\n\nAnother set of antitrust cases upended the real estate industry. Residential home sellers across the country alleged the National Association of Realtors, its member agents, and Keller Williams and HomeServices of America illegally required sellers to pay buyers' agent commissions.\n\nA federal jury in Missouri in one case returned a $1.78 billion verdict in favor of sellers, a figure that could as much as triple, or decrease, at the presiding judge's discretion.\n\nAnother case was dismissed. US Wholesale was not able to successfully argue that rival Living Essentials unfairly offered Costco better prices, discounts, and reimbursements on sales of 5-hour Energy. But the case left the door open to allow US Wholesale to refile its claim.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The stock is up 45% in the last six months and 22% year to date.\n\nWith a market cap of $1.93 trillion, shares recently surpassed all-time highs set in 2021 as investors become increasingly optimistic about profitability in its e-commerce operations and resurgent growth in cloud computing due to the recent boom in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon stock is now up 100% in the last five years. But what do the next five years look like? Can it repeat this stellar performance and double yet again? Let's take a look.\n\nE-commerce profit inflection, more growth ahead\n\nEven though the online store is now closing in on 30 years of operations, Amazon's e-commerce and global retail operations are still growing quickly. North American sales increased 12% in 2023 to $353 billion, with international operations growing 11% to $131.2 billion.\n\nEven though Amazon's platform is so dominant within the e-commerce sector, online shopping makes up only an estimated 15.6% of retail sales in the United States today. If that number can consistently rise over the next 10 to 20 years and Amazon can maintain its market share, there are still many years left to increase sales.\n\nThe best part about this growth at Amazon's e-commerce division is where it is coming from. Third-party seller services were up by 19% year over year last quarter, and advertising services increased 26%. These high-margin segments can drive overall profit margins higher if they keep growing quickly.\n\nAnd that is exactly what we are seeing today. North American operating margins hit 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, expanding for each of the last six quarters and reversing from negative 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2024, investors should expect e-commerce profit margins to continue climbing higher.\n\nA cloud computing rebound\n\nThe most profitable segment at the company is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In 2023, it generated over $90 billion in sales and $24.6 billion in operating income, giving it a profit margin of 27.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, back in late 2022 and early 2023, there were major concerns about a slowdown at AWS. Revenue growth fell from 28% in the 2022 third quarter to 12% in the 2023 second quarter as the company helped its software customers save on costs after the height of the pandemic.\n\nToday, these concerns have proved to be too pessimistic. AWS revenue accelerated in the fourth quarter to 13% growth, which has sent the stock higher. And 2024 and 2025 revenue looks promising with the rapid rise in AI services. These new products use a ton of cloud computing to operate, and AWS is looking to be one of the leaders in this space along with Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. For example, the company has signed an extensive agreement in the space with fast-growing start-up Anthropic.\n\nOver the next decade and beyond, analysts expect cloud computing to continue its ascent, increasing at a double-digit annual rate. If Amazon can maintain its market share lead as it has in e-commerce, AWS should have many years of growth left ahead. AMZN Chart\n\nWhere will Amazon stock be in five years?\n\nTo estimate where the stock will be five years from now, we need to make some profit estimates for both e-commerce and AWS. Let's assume that e-commerce -- excluding the unprofitable international segment -- can grow sales by 12% annually over the next five years and expand profit margins to 10%. That would put 2028 North American retail profits at $62 billion.\n\nDoing the same for AWS, let's assume five years of 12% growth and profit margins that remain at 27%. In 2028, that would equate to $43 billion in AWS profits. Add both numbers together and you get $105 billion in earnings from Amazon in 2028, and that excludes any upside from other divisions such as international e-commerce or satellite internet services.\n\nNow comes the hardest part: What earnings multiple will Amazon trade at in 2028? An exact answer is impossible, but with a wide competitive advantage in both cloud computing and e-commerce, I think the stock deserves to trade at an above-market multiple of 30 times earnings, otherwise known as a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E).\n\nMultiply $105 billion by 30 and you get a market cap of $3.15 trillion, or a 66% boost from today's price. While not a doubling, it looks like Amazon still has upside for shareholders who remain for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech will outperform in a high interest rate environment: Wall Street pros",
        "content": "No rate cuts, no problem.\n\nInvestors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday’s trading action, despite another hot inflation report that puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt.\n\nThat was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles.\n\n“Many of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,” Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree cash flow from Magnificent 7 members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — jumped more than $100 billion in 2023.\n\nLast week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet’s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year.\n\nAnd Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis.\n\nNewEdge Wealth’s Cameron Dawson said big tech’s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a “defensive” and “safety” play, adding that pullbacks are “likely buyable in the short-term.”\n\n“Tech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,” said Lerner.\n\nIn addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetrick expects continued economic growth to “offer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.”\n\nA more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term. Analysts estimate the sector’s first-quarter profits to surge 20%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives sees first-quarter results as a “major positive catalyst.”\n\n“We expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the strong start to 2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage,” Ives wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nTo sum it up: Delayed rate cuts don't mean a downturn for tech's biggest names. Rather, those with strong fundamentals can outperform — despite valuation and rate concerns — and potentially provide stability for the broader market landscape.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Fisker Stock’s Downfall: A Cautionary Tale for EV Investors",
        "content": "Fisker (OTCMKTS:FSRN) is bankrupt in all but name only. The company hangs on by the slimmest of threads that only a miracle bailout can save while Fisker stock is a literal penny stock trading at 2 cents per share on the over-the-counter exchanges.\n\nIt is a mighty fall for a company that went public less than four years ago in a $2.9 billion special purpose acquisition company merger. Fisker is one of the few companies that got two bites at the apple and dramatically failed both times. Yet, does that make it an anomaly or is it the fate of Fisker stock the same for all electric vehicle companies?\n\nThe End of Fisker Stock?\n\nInvestorPlace’s Eddie Pan recently detailed Fisker’s rise and fall 20 years ago and its rise and fall again today. It’s clear there were factors unique to Fisker stock both times that don’t or won’t apply to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), LucidGroup (NASDAQ:LCID) or Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor example, the federal government limiting EV tax credits only to vehicles assembled in the U.S. affected Fisker hard because its EVs are produced in Austria. Fisker’s domestic rivals make their vehicles here and are eligible for the incentive.\n\nHowever, it shows just how critical these subsidies are to EV manufacturers. Without the government underwriting their sale, an EV’s cost would be unattractive to a large majority of car buyers. And it’s not just in the U.S. either. Governments globally are all subsidizing the production of EVs.\n\nIn China, Beijing enacted a $72 billion incentive program last year that enables over 90% of EVs in the country to qualify for them. Some 20 European countries offer a variety of incentives, from tax exemptions to pricing reductions.\n\nIn Germany, where the government was forced to end its subsidy program early to plug a gaping budget hole last December, Tesla, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and other EV makers covered the lost incentives cost for buyers taking delivery by the end of the year.\n\nProfitability Pipe Dream\n\nWe’re already seeing a demand slowdown for EVs that’s global in scale. The market is still growing but at a much slower pace. That’s worrisome for EV makers already at the fringe of viability. The early adopters of the EV market have bought their cars. Now manufacturers need to convince the rest of car buyers that an EV purchase is worthwhile.\n\nFord (NYSE:F) slashing the price of its Lightning F-150 pickup trucks is an ominous sign for companies that are struggling to reach profitability. The ongoing price war among EV makers will delay that further into the future. Perhaps too far. But it’s going to take more than financial incentives to move consumers though.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over distances traveled between charges, availability of charging stations, safety issues and more have many concerned EV technology hasn’t come far enough to outweigh the reliability of fossil fuel-powered vehicles. It could be a high hurdle to get over.\n\nRivian and Lucid in particular have the hardest cases to make. However, because they still have deep-pocketed financial backers they likely won’t see the same fate as Fisker. At least not yet. Rivian still has Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) committed to buying its EVs while Lucid has the Saudi Arabian government keeping it afloat.\n\nToo Much Risk\n\nThe problem for investors is the stock market isn’t quite so confident. Rivian stock tumbled hard on Ford’s price cut new, sending shares below $10 a stub. Lucid began trading below that threshold a long time ago.\n\nIts stock also plummeted and it goes for $2.50 a share now. Tesla, as the most financially secure EV stock, is not at risk. That doesn’t make its stock a buy though.\n\nUnique circumstances may have caused Fisker’s implosion but it still serves as a cautionary tale for investors.\n\nA healthy EV market would have allowed Fisker to fix its problems and make a turnaround. The current EV industry means you should avoid buying EV stocks to see who the survivors will really be.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Why Nvidia's stock sell-off matters and what people are saying about it",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSomething weird happened in the stock market this week — besides the thumping from a surprise Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nMarket darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock fell into correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from a recent high.\n\nAt its low of around $830 midway through Tuesday's session, the stock was down 12.6% from its March 25 high. It has since recovered a bit to $900 but is still off by 5% from the highs.\n\n\"This is a breather for Nvidia, as more investors are playing the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of AI across the semi and software ecosystem,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. \"We view this as a digestion period for the Street for Nvidia and nothing more.\"\n\nMaybe that will prove correct. Who knows?\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes volatility in Nvidia is nothing new — the current sell-off marks the ninth time the stock has declined 10% or more since ChatGPT was launched back in late 2022.\n\n\"There are some market factors such as the recent rise in inflation, volatility (VIX), AI stock fatigue, rotation towards more cyclical sectors and possibly some pruning ahead of upcoming earnings season,\" Arya said. \"On a fundamental basis we have also heard of investor concern around rising competition and reducing lead-times (suggesting decelerating demand) for Nvidia GPU accelerators (though expected as new Blackwell demand grows).\" CEO Jensen Huang during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nI happen to think Nvidia's stock sell-off is a near-term headwind to the broader markets that should be respected way more than it is. Arya gets at it a bit in his note, but it warrants further amplification.\n\nHere is a stock truly beloved by Wall Street and Main Street — for real, fundamental reasons such as the AI explosion powering demand for super chips — losing ground. It's one of the clearest signs yet that investors think stocks have come on too hard and too fast this year against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the price action suggests investors who are actively seeking new reasons to buy stocks at peak valuations are coming up empty. Now, they may simply be waiting to buy top names like Nvidia at cheaper prices.\n\nThat wait-and-see mindset is what the pros are doing with Nvidia's stock and other stocks with a high valuation but well-understood investment thesis.\n\nAnd it's not like we haven't seen Nvidia leading the broader market lower before — it happened last summer!\n\nEvercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel correctly pointed out that Nvidia's stock did next to nothing from July 2023 to October 2023 (chart below). It ended up being the catalyst that brought the S&P 500 lower.\n\nBottom line: For the broader market to get its mojo back, its favorite stock has to get its mojo back.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before It Surges 16%, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is in full swing. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are trading near record levels, and many on Wall Street are anticipating further gains.\n\nAmong the hottest names in AI are the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- a catchy moniker used to collectively describe megacap behemoths Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia have been identified as two early darlings in the AI revolution. But e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon has quietly made some notable progress of its own.\n\nBrian Nowak of Morgan Stanley recently raised his price target for Amazon stock to $215 -- implying roughly 15% upside as of market close on April 10.\n\nLet's break down why now could be a terrific opportunity to scoop up shares of Amazon.\n\nCash flow is king\n\nThe last couple of years have been challenging for Amazon. The macroeconomy has been plagued by unusually high inflation, causing the Federal Reserve to enforce a number of aggressive interest rate hikes.\n\nThe combination of lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs had a meaningful impact on both consumers and businesses. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud software businesses witnessed stalling growth as corporations and consumers reined in spending.\n\nNevertheless, Amazon's management adjusted and proved that the company can thrive even during more daunting economic periods. During 2023, inflation began to cool while artificial intelligence (AI) became all the rage in the tech sector.\n\nAmazon's growth began to accelerate again -- but it was the company's profitability profile that really shined. Image source: Amazon Investor Relations.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon generated a jaw-dropping $36.8 billion in free cash flow, which is what's left over from cash flow after operations expenses and capital spending This is quite a turnaround considering that the year before, Amazon burned $11.6 billion of cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most encouraging part about Amazon's consistent and compounding cash flow is that it comes from different sides of the company's business.\n\nAmazon buckets its online and physical stores as well as its advertising businesses into geographic categories called North America and International. In 2023, the combined operating income for these segments was $12.2 billion -- a major reversal from a combined operating loss of $10.6 billion in 2022.\n\nBut it was Amazon's cloud business that really helped reignite the company's return to profitability. Sales in Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased 13% year over year in 2023 to $90.6 billion while boasting an impressive 27% operating margin.\n\nAmazon's strong performance in high-growth markets, combined with its robust cash-flow profile, are what make the company stand out among its peers. It's no wonder the company has earned a spot in the portfolios of both Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett.\n\nWhile there was a lot to celebrate in 2023, Amazon isn't resting on its laurels. Savvy investments in artificial intelligence (AI) could be the key to unlock the company's next phase of supercharged growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an enormous opportunity\n\nMicrosoft really kicked off the AI revolution after its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. The move was the impetus for more aggressive spending in the AI arena from big tech in particular.\n\nAmazon followed Microsoft with its own investment in a competing platform called Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud services provider. This is a huge deal and should not be underestimated. The partnership with Anthropic could spell a new wave of lead generation for AWS and serve as catalyst for accelerated further growth -- on both the top and bottom line.\n\nAdditionally, Anthropic will also be using Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips to develop and enhance its generative AI models. This is a subtle opportunity that investors should keep an eye on. For now, the semiconductor market is dominated by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nHowever, Amazon's foray into the chip market could be a lucrative opportunity in the long run as the company seeks to disrupt several facets of the AI realm.\n\nA magnificent valuation\n\nThe chart below benchmarks the Magnificent Seven stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. Amazon's P/S of 3.4 is the lowest among this cohort by wide a margin. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nMy take is that Amazon's position within the AI landscape is misunderstood. In contrast to Amazon, there are very few companies that can benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple ways.\n\nConsidering Amazon's business spans e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, and streaming, there are a host of ways for the company to apply AI across its ecosystem. This could lead to a new period of exponential growth in both revenue and profits.\n\nGiven Amazon's discounted valuation relative to peers, I think now is a terrific opportunity to scoop up some shares as the secular themes in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to play out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Ready to Invest in Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2 Stocks That Are Solid Bets.",
        "content": "Everyone's been talking about artificial intelligence (AI), and it may be one of the hottest investment areas today. Why? Because the technology has the potential to transform many industries, saving time and money for companies, and even result in lifesaving discoveries -- such as better drugs and medical devices. Analysts expect the AI market to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nEven though many AI stocks have soared, though, this doesn't mean you've missed out if you haven't already invested in this exciting field. The AI growth story is just getting started, meaning there's plenty of room for the strongest players to continue advancing over time. So, if you're ready to invest in AI, check out these two stocks that make solid long-term bets. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nYou probably know Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) best for its e-commerce business, but the company is also building its presence in the world of AI. It's using the technology to streamline operations within fulfillment centers, for example, and better serve customers. But where Amazon truly is going all in on AI is in the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" chief executive officer Andy Jassy wrote in Amazon's recent shareholder letter. He also said generative AI may be the biggest game-changing technology since the Internet.\n\nJassy says Amazon is \"deeply investing\" in the three layers that make up AI -- over time, this could make AWS the go-to place for businesses seeking to launch AI projects. These layers include the building blocks for foundation models such as chips and software, a fully managed service for customers wanting to leverage an already existing foundation model, and finally applications driven by AI.\n\nSince AWS today is the world's No. 1 cloud computing company, it's perfectly positioned to sell these solutions to customers and become an AI giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd when you buy shares of Amazon, you have this exposure to a high-growth area but also the security of booming e-commerce and cloud businesses that helped the company report double-digit revenue growth last year and more than $30 billion in net income. All of this makes Amazon stock, trading at 44 times forward earnings estimates, well worth the price.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another company that may be an important part of your daily life -- if you use Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram. This social media giant owns all four, and thanks to these apps, it brings in billions of dollars in advertising revenue every year. Chances are this will continue because two things in particular should keep users coming back to Meta, therefore prompting advertisers to keep coming back to reach them.\n\nFirst, Meta has a strong moat or competitive advantage in the world of social media, and that's its broad audience of loyal users -- making it difficult for any of us to switch to another platform. If we do, we may not be able to connect with all of our contacts. Meta estimates that more than 3.1 billion people use at least one of its apps every day.\n\nNow here's the second reason why Meta should stay ahead. The company is putting a focus on AI, making the technology its biggest investment area this year. Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg says he aims to bring on board about 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) of compute this year in order ensure enough capacity for the company's projects.\n\nMeta's plan includes launching AI tools across its products and services, making them better and better for both leisure and professional use. And Meta, developer of the Llama large language model, is maintaining its software as open source so that it might become an industry standard -- another positive point for the company. Considering this and Meta's track record of earnings growth, the stock looks cheap at 26 times forward earnings estimates -- and makes a solid AI bet to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,963!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $33,315!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $335,887!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 8, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most undervalued value stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and undervalued stocks, then you can check out 5 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAmong the several categories that stocks can be divided into, two categories are value stocks and growth stocks. They stand on the opposite end of the spectrum and cater to investors with different kinds of risk appetite and goals. These stocks are defined primarily through the price to earnings ratio, which measures the premium that the stock market is paying over the firm's ability to make a profit. The higher the ratio is, the more a stock can be said to be a 'growth' stock and vice versa, with the industry in which the value stock or growth stock belongs also playing a crucial role as different sectors often have wildly varying P/E ratios.\n\nInvestors who pile into growth stocks do so to grow their money. A stock with a high P/E ratio shows that the market believes that it will grow its earnings significantly in the future and is therefore willing to bet on this future growth in the present. On the flip side, value stocks are for those investors who just want to place their money in a stable security and just forget about it. As opposed to growth stocks, whose high P/E ratio comes with the risk of significant share price drop in case of an untoward event, value stocks are relatively insulated since investors have not paid a hefty premium over their earnings. One exception to this statement is value traps which are stocks with strong current earnings but negative earnings growth rates. Value traps may look cheap but investors face significant capital destruction risk.\n\nThis fundamental difference between value stocks and growth stocks is most often based on their business models. So say, one example of a value stock, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), is unlikely to be perceived by investors to leave a blazing trail in its wake of pursuing high technology innovation. On the flip side, investors of the eCommerce behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), rightly have high expectations from the firm when it comes to maintaining a foothold (or stronghold) in the high growth eCommerce market and artificial intelligence. This is also reflected in Amazon's forward and trailing P/E ratios which currently sit at 43.67 and 63.82, respectively. For more on growth stocks, you can check out 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother set of categories that stocks can be divided into are undervalued and overvalued stocks. In fact, stock valuation sits at the heart of an investing philosophy called Value Investing. This set of beliefs has found some highly successful adherents on Wall Street, with two notable ones being Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. At its heart, value investing involves determining the fair or true value of a stock and then comparing it with the market price. If the market price is lower, then an investing decision is made depending on the difference between the two called the margin of safety. The greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels with their decision as it reduces the amount of losses in case of the share price dropping in an untoward event. Stocks that have a fair value that is higher than the market value are called undervalued stocks, and those whose market price is higher are called overvalued stocks - with the market price being the primary determinant of the valuation adjective.\n\nThe next question to ask is, what constitutes a fair value of a stock? Well, one commonly used proxy for this is the analyst share price targets. Sell side financial firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employ analysts whose sole job is to see what the value of a firm's stock can be based on different metrics such as future cash flows. Averaging these price targets aims to remove some of the biases present in a single analyst's analysis and it is often used as a proxy for fair value.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the most undervalued value stocks, we can check to see if investing in undervalued stocks has its merits or not. Well, we don't have to look too far to find a list of undervalued stocks. One such list is Insider Monkey's coverage of 14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now. This list used consensus undervalued stock picks of the financial media and was published in mid September 2023. The average six month share price performance of all the stocks on this list is 19.64% and ranges from 44.64% for Amazon to -22.77% for the lithium provider Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nAlbermarle has suffered amidst a glut in the global lithium industry that has been hurt from oversupply and slow demand, and here's what The London Company had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nALB underperformed as weak lithium prices drove downward revisions to earnings expectations, and sentiment became more negative regarding demand for electric vehicles. Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long-term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply-demand dynamics for the commodity.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most undervalued value stocks that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG). 10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued value stocks we first made a list of 40 stocks with P/E ratios under 15 and average analyst percentage share price upside greater than 20%. Then, the 20 stocks with the highest upside were selected, and they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were selected.\n\nFor these undervalued value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\n10.

        "content": "When stocks maintain sales growth and returns on invested capital over long periods, they can be tremendous compounders. Let’s discuss some stocks for life-changing returns with multibagger potential.\n\nFirst, these stocks must have a long growth runway, possibly over a decade. Thus, these stocks must have secular tailwinds or idiosyncratic factors supporting growth. For instance, secular growth opportunities like e-commerce or idiosyncratic expansion options like new locations.\n\nSecondly, these stocks must have a proven track record of growth. Using this Finviz Screen, I selected stocks that had grown revenues by 20% annually over the past five years. Also, I filtered for stocks that grew sales by 5% quarter-over-quarter in the most recent earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, I checked for forward growth prospects. After all, we buy stocks for their potential, not their past performance. These three stocks will grow EPS by 20% annually in the next five years and are top stocks for life-changing returns.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona.\n\nSource: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis drive-thru beverage chain could be among the best stocks for life-changing returns. Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) sells customizable iced, hot and blended beverages, with coffee making up 50% of the menu mix.\n\nIf the company executes the growth plan laid out at the ICR Conference 2024, it will be among the best stocks for life-changing returns. The company has been a growth engine, doubling total shops and quadrupling company-operated shops since fiscal year 2019. As a result, revenues grew from $238.4 million in FY2019 to $965.8 million in FY2023.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the company had 831 shops, 542 company-operated and 289 franchised. This leaves a massive growth runway as the chain expands across the U.S. Management targets over 4,000 shops in the long term, focusing on shops offering drive-through convenience.\n\nBesides new shops, the company plans to earn more revenue from current customers. It intends to leverage its rewards program and use more targeted offers. Lastly, the company is banking on increasing scale to drive operating leverage, targeting contributions margins above 30%.\n\nConsidering the combination of new shop openings and improving margins, Dutch Bros could be one of the top stocks for life-changing returns.

It has been one of the best Canadian-based stocks, but the run isn’t over.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify is crucial in supporting merchants who sell online and offline worldwide. Through its platform, merchants can manage their business and sell wherever buyers are. While the platform has traditionally been a hub for small businesses, it’s now attracting larger brands. Through Shopify Plus, the company is pursuing the largest retailers and brands in the world.\n\nIt has developed a modern retail stack that even the largest retailers can use. Subscription businesses like Dollar Shave Club use the platform to sell their products. Industrial companies like Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) have joined the service to sell their business-to-business products. Increasingly, brands like Supreme are outsourcing their e-commerce stack to Shopify.\n\nToday, Shopify is the second largest checkout in the U.S., behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Due to its e-commerce dominance, revenue growth has been outstanding. In the latest quarter, it grew revenue 26% and generated $905 million in free cash flow. Growth could accelerate as Shopify moves upmarket and targets large retailers and enterprises.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to Janney Montgomery Scott, cybersecurity is one of the major investment themes for the next decade. The rise of state actors pursuing geopolitical wins through cyber warfare and hackers using AI has increased the need for robust defenses. Statista projects the cybersecurity market will grow at a 10.56% compounded annual growth rate between 2024 and 2028.\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is one of the best well-positioned stocks for life-changing returns. Notably, it benefits from the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure guidelines enacted last year. These guidelines, plus the record ransomware attacks in 2023, have made Chief Technology Officers prioritize spending on cyber security.\n\nBesides, the government is working on its cybersecurity defenses as state-sponsored attacks surge. In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order urging all federal agencies to adopt zero-trust security architecture. This directive favors Zscaler since FedRAMP has already approved it. Already, the company is securing 12 cabinet-level agencies.\n\nAfter growing revenues by over 40% in the last five years, Zscaler’s growth story is far from over. Management expects FY2024 revenues of $2.118 billion to $2.122 billion, representing at least 30% growth. Over the long term, the demand for cybersecurity from governments and enterprises will grow, ultimately benefiting Zscaler.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in ZS but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Billionaire Investors Are Selling Nvidia and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest game in town for investors. Much of the big gains for the stock market in 2023 and 2024 have been driven by surging interest in everything AI.\n\nNo company has been more at the forefront of the AI boom than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's share price skyrocketed 239% last year and is up close to 75% this year. But is the enthusiasm about Nvidia beginning to fade? Maybe so. Two billionaire investors are selling Nvidia and buying another AI stock instead.\n\nThumbs down to Nvidia\n\nDavid Tepper is known to many as the owner of the Carolina Panthers. However, he amassed enough money to buy the NFL franchise by achieving tremendous success with the hedge fund he founded in 1993, Appaloosa Management. Today, Tepper's net worth stands at $20.6 billion.\n\nTepper is bullish about AI. Eight of the top 10 holdings in Appaloosa's portfolio are AI stocks. Nvidia ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest position, but Tepper seems to think the stock's tremendous momentum could be near an end. In the fourth quarter of 2023, he sold almost 23% of Appaloosa's stake in the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker.\n\nHe isn't the only billionaire investor now noticeably less excited about Nvidia. Chase Coleman first made his mark in the investment world by working with legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Coleman next ran his own hedge fund, Tiger Global Management, which later expanded into venture capital. He's now worth $5.7 billion.\n\nTiger Global Management reduced its position in Nvidia in Q4 by nearly 13%. Nvidia still claims the No. 10 spot in the hedge fund's portfolio with a stake valued at roughly $480 million at the end of 2023. However, Coleman is taking some of his profits off the table with the stock after making big gains.\n\nThumbs up to Amazon\n\nBoth Tepper and Coleman saw Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as a better AI stock to buy in Q4. Tepper's Appaloosa fund increased its position in the e-commerce and cloud-services giant by more than 5%. Coleman's Tiger Global Management upped its stake in Amazon by 24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are these two billionaire investors more bullish about Amazon than Nvidia? I suspect Tepper and Coleman might think Nvidia's valuation is now at a level where any sign of trouble could cause a steep sell-off. At the same time, Amazon appears to be building sustainable momentum.\n\nAI is definitely a key growth driver for Amazon. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the top cloud-services provider based on market share. AWS is especially investing heavily in supporting generative AI development.\n\nAmazon is using generative AI internally as well. CEO Andy Jassy said in the company's Q4 earnings conference call, \"[W]e believe it [generative AI] will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nOf course, Amazon isn't just an AI stock. The company's efforts to increase profitability in its e-commerce business continue to pay off. Amazon has delivered seven consecutive quarters of improving operating margins in its North America business segment.\n\nIt has also become a key player in the digital-advertising market. Amazon's advertising revenue soared 26% year over year in Q4. And that growth came before the company launched its ads on Prime Video.\n\nBuying more shares of Amazon has already paid off for Tepper and Coleman. The stock is up over 20% year to date.\n\nShould you buy Amazon too?\n\nInvestors shouldn't sell Nvidia and buy Amazon only because two hedge fund billionaires have. However, it's not a bad idea to examine the potential reasons behind Tepper and Coleman's moves.\n\nI think the reasons Tepper and Coleman added more shares of Amazon in Q4 are still applicable now. The company's profits will likely continue to rise. AI and advertising remain strong growth drivers. Amazon is still an excellent long-term pick, in my view.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG): Should You Ride This Rocket Higher?",
        "content": "Maybe you’ve seen the trending stock tickers today and noticed that Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock was on a rocket ride higher. There’s nothing wrong with momentum, but investors should look into the reason for the move and make their own decisions. I am bearish on CPNG stock, and as we delve into what’s actually going on with Coupang, you might decide to find better investment opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Coupang is as South Korea’s version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It’s a popular e-commerce company with an order-fulfillment service called Rocket Delivery.\n\nCPNG stock was on the move today, and you may be tempted to go all-in on the South Korean Amazon. However, be sure to learn all of the relevant facts before making any investment decisions. After all, a stock can be vulnerable to a pullback if a rally isn’t really justified.\n\nA Bigger Company Could Threaten Coupang\n\nBefore we get into the headline news, there’s a development that prospective Coupang investors can’t afford to ignore. Specifically, a huge company is reportedly taking steps to compete directly with Coupang.\n\nThis company is much bigger than Coupang — and no, it’s not Amazon. Rather, it’s China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which has a $184.13 billion market cap, as opposed to Coupang’s $38.16 billion market cap.\n\nHere’s the scoop, courtesy of Nikkei’s Kotaro Hosokawa (via TheFly). Apparently, Alibaba plans to invest $1.1 billion “over the next three years to create a logistics network in South Korea.” With this move, Alibaba intends to take on Coupang “by leveraging low prices and speedy deliveries.”\n\nFor an e-commerce business, being threatened by Alibaba in Asia would be like being threatened by Amazon in the U.S. It’s just bad news for Coupang.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba has the capital resources to cause problems for Coupang. Reportedly, Alibaba will build a logistics center in a 180,000-square-meter lot this year, as well as a call center with 300 employees. Plus, Alibaba plans to establish a “purchasing department to sell local products overseas, aiming to boost exports for 50,000 small South Korean businesses over three years.”\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the market is simply ignoring this news, as short-term traders are obsessing over a new development with Coupang. Still, big-picture thinkers shouldn’t just dismiss the threat that Alibaba will pose to Coupang in the coming years.\n\nWhy Was Coupang Stock Up 11.5% Today?\n\nSo, here’s the catalyst that caused CPNG stock to rally 11.5% today. As The Korea Times reported, Coupang plans to increase its monthly Wow service (which is similar to Amazon’s Prime service) membership fee from 4,990 South Korean won previously to a new price of 7,890 won (equivalent to approximately $5.74).\n\nIf this doesn’t seem like a big deal, bear in mind that $5.74 can be a lot of money for families in different regions of the world. Moreover, this is a 58% increase in the monthly Wow service fee.\n\nSurely, Coupang’s customers are now saying “wow” to the “Wow” service, but not in a good way. This probably should go without saying, but The Korea Times stated, “Many consumers [are] displeased with [the] steep price hike.”\n\nLet’s put this into perspective. Without a doubt, some customers haven’t been particularly happy about Amazon’s Prime membership price hikes throughout the years. However, at least Amazon had the sense to make those price increases somewhat gradual — not 58% all at once.\n\nMy point is that this could backfire in a big way. In the immediate term, stock traders are probably over-focused on the revenue-generating potential of Coupang’s Wow service price hike. If the company loses angry customers, though, then there could be long-term damage to Coupang’s bottom line. That’s the last thing Coupang needs as Alibaba makes major moves to steal some of the company’s market share in South Korea.\n\nIs Coupang Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CPNG comes in as a Moderate Buy based on three Buys and two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average CPNG stock price target is $21.75, implying 2.35% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CPNG stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Seyon Park of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with an average return of 16.1% per rating and an 89% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Coupang Stock?\n\nCoupang is certainly an intriguing company that might be compared to Amazon. Yet, even the mammoth Amazon didn’t have the audacity to raise its subscription service fee by 58% all at once. Truly, Coupang’s huge price hike is either a brilliant move or just reckless and greedy.\n\nPersonally, I don’t consider it to be a brilliant move. Coupang needs to keep its customers happy, especially with Alibaba threatening to make a move into Coupang’s home turf. Consequently, even though CPNG stock is quickly moving higher, I’m not considering owning it now.\n\nDisclosure",

This rise is attributed to the remarkable gains of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared by approximately 81% due to the high demand for its AI computing chips.

        "title": "3 Hydrogen Stocks to Turn $300K Into $1 Million: April 2024",
        "content": "2023 was a forgettable year for hydrogen stocks and the broader clean energy industry. Geopolitical issues, heightened interest rates, and rampant inflationary pressures were to blame for clean energy’s lackluster showing. Moreover, the Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSEARCA:HJEN) lost 20% of its value last year. This indicates the challenges confronted by the market.\n\nNonetheless, hydrogen stocks could become multi-bagger investments for investors with a long-term investing horizon. Hydrogen and other renewable energy sources are critical components in the global effort to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change. The hydrogen market alone is expected to grow by 7.80% from 2023 to 2030 to reach $410.6 billion.\n\nWith that, here are three hydrogen stocks worth betting on for long-term gains. If you invest $300K equally in the three hydrogen stocks discussed, aiming for the amount to compound to $1 million over a decade, each stock will need to grow by 233%. Such extraordinary gains may seem daunting, but they seem likely given the tailwinds propelling the sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBloom Energy (BE) Bloom Energy logo at their headquarters in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is a leading solid oxide fuel cell provider that’s made big headway over several years. This can be seen from the 438% increase in its top-line over the past decade to $1.33 billion last year. However, its stellar operating performance hasn’t been reflected in its stock price, with BE stock down 50% in the past three years. Nevertheless, it remains an attractive long-term play, especially with its foray into the hydrogen industry.\n\nThe company’s game-changing Bloom Electrolyzer promises to redefine hydrogen energy production through its unmatched efficiency. This is while the company generates an impressive 20% to 25% more hydrogen per megawatt than its competition. Moreover, it can be deployed within two months, adding to its tremendous accessibility. With the global focus on clean energy intensifying, I expect Bloom’s hydrogen business to play a major role in its long-term growth trajectory.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) a symbol with H2 (hydrogen) on it and a fill-up tank\n\nSource: Alexander Kirch / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is known for its popular EV charger business. Its hydrogen initiatives could take its business to the next level. It’s currently the largest supplier of liquid hydrogen. Moreover, its cutting-edge hydrogen-powered fuel cells have proven a hit with the biggest supply chain and logistics businesses. It’s formed strategic partnerships with giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), to name a few.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be fair, you need a strong stomach to handle investing in PLUG at this point. Its stock sank more than 60% last year, which aligns with the EV market slowdown. Consequently, its losses are widening, posing serious questions about its long-term financial positioning. To control the bleeding, it implemented a cost-cutting initiative, which should help save $75 million. Cutting operational costs and strategic review is likely to positively impact PLUG’s business as it navigates an incredibly challenging phase.\n\nBP (BP)\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock.com\n\nBP (NYSE:BP) is an oil and gas titan and one of the best low-risk ways to gain exposure to the hydrogen space. The fossil fuel giant has been diversifying its energy portfolio towards sustainable energy, and hydrogen is a huge part of the transition.\n\nThe great thing about BP is that its core business is stable, and it continues to generate billions in free cash flows to support its green energy initiatives. Through its vast experience, extensive infrastructure, and colossal internal reserves, BP is looking to spearhead the hydrogen energy revolution.\n\nWith more than 10 projects in Europe, the U.S., and Australia, BP aims to produce 0.5 to 0.7 million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen each year. In the U.K. alone, BP targets 500MW of green and 1GW of blue hydrogen production by the end of the current decade. Also, its Australian Renewable Energy subsidiary is set to generate 1.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually. This positions BP as a true juggernaut in the clean energy transition.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) race heats up primarily due to a boom in the generative AI space, the demand for cutting-edge chips that can handle AI-related massive workloads keeps rising. These chips are equipped with strong computing power that makes the training of large language models seamless.\r\n\r\nIn this backdrop, strong endeavors being made by the cloud trio — Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL — as well as the social media giant Meta Platforms META, to put their AI-specific customized chips on the table remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis underscores the idea of staying self-sufficient in the intensifying AI battle in order to accelerate the development process of AI models, which, in turn, will help them pace up advancements in the AI world.\n\nWill NVIDIA Face Challenges?\n\nNVIDIA NVDA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is riding on solid demand for its next-generation chips for AI models. Reportedly, it holds more than 90% of the AI chips market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, the strategy of building in-house chips of these tech giants in order to reduce dependency on outside chip providers does not bode well for NVIDIA. It will stiffen the chip competition for NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nAlso, NVDA will start losing market share if its major customers start making their chips. This is a major concern.\r\n\r\nNotably, the waiting time for its flagship AI chip is months long, which is causing the scarcity. Nvidia can produce only a limited number of chips at a time because it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor to assemble the chip designs.\r\n\r\nThis is the primary reason why AI behemoths are now coming up with their chips.\r\n\r\nEven if the chips being made by Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are not as strong as NVIDIA’s, they can be customized. This will not only save their costs but will also save time.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow GOOGL, META, MSFT & AMZN Fare in AI Chip Race?\n\nAlphabet’s Google recently heated the AI battle with the introduction of its central processing unit (CPU), namely Axion, to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are marked as the company’s first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nAlphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, intends to scale Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine and the YouTube Ads platform on Axion soon.\r\n\r\nGoogle will make Axion available to its cloud customers later this year. Customers will be able to use Axion in cloud services like Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow and Cloud Batch.\r\n\r\nFollowing Google’s move, Meta announced advanced infrastructure for AI to push deep into the AI chip race. It introduced the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. Notably, MTIA is the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s advancement over MTIA v1 — its first-generation AI inference accelerator, which was designed in-house with Meta’s AI workloads.\r\n\r\nNotably, MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth. It is capable of managing the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users, seamlessly. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft unveiled two customized chips, namely Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, late last year. While the Arm-based Cobalt 100 is made for general computing tasks, Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes.\r\n\r\nNotably, Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like LLM training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors. The Zacks Rank #3 company collaborated with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. It is currently being tested on Bing’s AI chatbot Copilot, the GitHub Copilot coding assistant and GPT-3.5-Turbo.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, unveiled AWS Trainium2 chips made for training and running AI models. These chips are designed to power the highest-performance compute on AWS for training foundation models quickly at a lower cost, while consuming less energy. Further, they are capable of delivering up to 4 times better performance and two times better energy efficiency than the first-generation Trainium, which was introduced in 2020.\r\n\r\nNotably, a cluster of 100,000 Trainium chips can train a 300-billion parameter AI large language model in weeks versus months. Trainium 2 chips will be available in Amazon EC2 Trn2 instances, containing 16 Trainium chips in a single instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon Is Positioned as the Foundation for Retail and Technology Infrastructure",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the first stocks I owned, and it has continued to serve me well throughout the years. I do not expect this to change anytime soon, and I believe that the company's long-term results should continue to be good, with higher margins likely from a shift to serving third parties and pioneering initiatives in artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nWhile there are some regulatory inhibitions to the fast adoption of some operations and a valuation that is not cheap, I believe the goodwill associated with Amazon shares and its strong price return will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nRecent developments\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAmazon is making a significant shift toward high-margin segments of its operations, including honing in on third-party seller services, advertising and subscription services. This is helping the company in two ways. Not only is it expanding Amazon's gross profit margins, but it is also diversifying its revenue streams away from pure e-commerce, which is now growing at a slower pace.\n\nThe company's investment in generative artificial intelligence, such as through Amazon Q and its strategic partnerships with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) for AWS Marketplace access and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) for AI-supported medicine manufacturing and development, show further strength in margin expansion opportunities to come. Amazon Q is an AI-powered assistant that aims to improve productivity in the workplace, and I believe it is integrations like this, iterated and evolving within the company, that will continue to solidify it not only as an e-commerce platform, but as a fully AI-integrated efficiency provider, both in retail goods, digital services through Amazon Web Services and partnerships and investments.\n\nAdditionally, Prime Air drone deliveries will reduce delivery times and costs for lightweight packages, which should help to drive demand and also increase margins. Incredibly, the service has the ability to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles. This not only enhances customer satisfaction, which is one of Amazon's long-standing value propositions, but also reduces road traffic and the company's carbon footprint.\n\nStory continues\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about Amazon as a business is how relentlessly innovative it is, which I believe is something that has been instilled in the company's ethos and executive management by founder Jeff Bezos, who has two core principles that I find particularly promising. The first is his very long-term-oriented focus, which positions the company well for investors like myself, who intend to hold Amazon stock for many decades. The second is his willingness to invest in new technology. When Bezos first started Amazon, it began as a cutting-edge technology tool in retail, and he has kept this perspective of being cutting-edge clearly at the forefront of his mind and trained management to be focused on this, too. Indeed, many companies want to keep up with the latest developments, but what Bezos does differently is he pioneers many of these developments and, at his core, he is an inventor, which is quite apparent in his annual shareholder letters.\n\nWith the infrastructure in place and what I would argue is a sizable moat in computing infrastructure through AWS, Amazon's brightest future is arguably in the provision of services for third parties. In many ways, it intends to act as the foundation for advanced technology and retail services for almost all providers. The scope and scale of the services it provides are what position it to continue to be attractive to a range of participants, with very little immediate competition. In my opinion, AWS faces the highest threat from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud Platform, but these are clearly not as extensive or as entrenched as AWS in so many different areas of provision. In many respects, AWS is several steps ahead of even the most advanced peers.\n\nPeer analysis\n\nFor competitive comparison and the purposes of investment opportunity cost analysis, I have placed Amazon alongside four other companies, which I believe are very compelling at the present moment of technological evolution. I have broken down the core metrics of each of these companies into the following table:\n\nAmazon Microsoft Alphabet Salesforce ServiceNow Equity-to-Asset 0.38 0.51 0.7 0.6 0.44 Net Margin 5.29% 36.27% 24.01% 11.87% 19.3% 3Y EPS Growth Rate 14.3% 19.4% 32.3% 45.3% 140.6% 3Y Futue EPS CAGR Estimate 38.53% 16.6% 14.43% 16.66% 21.11% Forward PE Ratio 43.67 31.85 22.42 31.06 56.62 IPO 1997 1986 2004 2004 2012 Market Cap $1.92T $3.16T $1.9T $292.85B $160.62 10Y Price Return 1,031.13% 968.61% 456.05% 446.84% 1,440.50%\n\n*EPS is without NRI\n\nBased on the chart, I believe it is quite clear that Amazon does not command software-like margins as the other four peers do. This is because Amazon is currently largely in the retail industry, but, as discussed above, its margin situation should improve as it becomes more focused on third-party service provisions. This is true across the range of its operations, from Amazon.com e-commerce through to AWS and Prime Video, which is acting as an aggregator for entertainment rather than simply offering in-house productions. Because Amazon now has a moat in infrastructure, I believe it will be able to crucially boost its margins and position itself as a unique retail-software hybrid that grows more focused on a monopoly in advanced software and services for professional use. Its operational expenses should be reduced as a result of this, but even where it faces expensive foundational services like warehousing and delivery, it can reduce this through AI-assisted and automated tasks, driving further growth as it replaces manual labor roles with positions in more advanced software engineering and AI deployment.\n\nI like Amazon for what it is turning into, but all of the peers in my analysis look very favorable to me. I own four of the five, with ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) a likely addition over the next year. The only element that significantly deters me from investing in ServiceNow at this time is its very high valuation, which creates some uncertainty about how the stock will perform if it fails to meet analysts' high expectations for its future results.\n\nValuation\n\nAmazon's valuation, for that matter, is also quite high, but much more bearable than ServiceNow. This is where the market has correctly priced Amazon as a unique software-retail hybrid and not as a pure retail investment.\n\nAmazon's forward price-eranings ratio of around 44 places it in the bottom 15% of companies in the retail-cyclical industry, according to GuruFocus' dataset. The retail industry median forward price-earnings ratio is around 16, but the software industry median is around 24.5. In essence, Amazon trades at a premium to both industries at scale, but this is arguably warranted when we consider the higher growth rates and profitability it commands compared to the wider retail industry and some of the software industry.\n\nI believe the market has priced a premium above what would be considered fair by analyzing the pure fundamentals, and there is undoubtedly a lot of investor sentiment, or goodwill, in the valuation of the company that has been commanded over the long term by the market. This is quite normal for the technology industry and is seen most prevalently in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has a forward price-earnings ratio of 54.64 at the time of this writing, while the stock is down nearly 60% from its all-time high.\n\nFurther, the 10-year median price-earnings ratio for Amazon is 116.26 and the current price-earnings ratio is 63.77. While the company's revenue growth and earnings growth have slowed down in recent years, the valuation has adjusted appropriately. As such, I believe the stock at this time is roughly fairly valued, with no margin of safety, but with a strong operational position that should continue to deliver good long-term growth despite any short-term volatility that may occur if expectations are not met.\n\nRegulatory inhibitions\n\nOther than the valuation, which offers no security, I believe there are risks with regulatory controls on drone delivery and automated driving that will inhibit some of Amazon's loftier plans in the near term.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration regulates drone flights, and any errors in flights and safety could result in temporary suspension of the services. Automated driving is also heavily regulated by bodies such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There is very strict oversight on the deployment of autonomous vehicles as there is skepticism about the safety of full-scale operations. While this is ungrounded in terms of the data, which shows it is much safer for advanced robots to command vehicles than humans, it is going to take some time for this to be accepted as the truth. The NHTSA has found that human error is the result of around 94% of all road accidents, and the Eno Center for Transportation has suggested that if 90% of all cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, accidents could decrease by up to 90%. Additionally, research by Waymo, one of the leaders in autonomous technology, reported that their vehicles had lower rates of contact with cyclists and pedestrians compared to national U.S. averages.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I consider Amazon to be an excellent company and now remains a great time to invest. The company is now dominant in technology and professional infrastructure for a wide range of services, and I believe it will begin to most acutely capitalize on this with the heavy integration of AI and automated tasks as it begins to focus more heavily on services for third parties.\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon is one of the best businesses in the world, founded by one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time, and having continued success in driving excellent shareholder returns seems probable to me. Even given the regulatory inhibitions that could prove challenging in the short term and a valuation with no margin of safety, the fundamental growth and goodwill of the company looks like it will cause the stock to continue to outperform the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "The generative AI boom has Big Tech companies racing to out-innovate each other by offering new features and platforms that take advantage of the hottest tech trend in years. And Wall Street wants to know how all those AI apps are going to pay off.\n\nTo that end, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and others are increasingly looking for ways to monetize their AI efforts. Case in point, during its annual Google Cloud Next developers conference this week, Google announced its latest paid generative AI service: AI classification for its Workspace productivity suite designed to boost user security.\n\nThe AI classification is an add-on for Google’s Workspace Business and Workspace Enterprise, which cost $20 per user per month and $30 per user per month, respectively, that adds $10 per user per month.\n\nAccording to Google Workspace vice president of product management Yulie Kwon Kim, the feature is designed to automatically classify important documents within organizations to prevent them from being shared, copied, or otherwise leaked to the public.\n\n“We use this feature here at Google, and it helps us identify and classify 900 million internal files,” Kim told Yahoo Finance. “So, this has boosted ... our data protection capabilities, improving accuracy, dramatically increasing coverage, and saving team members a lot of time, and this solves a problem that every organization has out there.”\n\nKim was also sure to note that while rival Microsoft has been dealing with security foul-ups with its Exchange service, including one from 2023 that a Department of Homeland Security report recently blamed on a “cascade of security failures at the Windows maker,” Google’s Workspace hasn’t had any such issues. A Google corporate logo hangs above the entrance to their office at St. John's Terminal on March 31, 2024, in New York City. (Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) (Gary Hershorn via Getty Images)\n\n“One in three of the most exploited vulnerabilities in 2022 were in Microsoft Exchange, so that's hitting a lot of businesses out there. And this number was zero for Google workspace,” she said.\n\nIn addition to its AI classification add-on, Google says it’s also using large language models, the foundation of today’s generative AI platforms, to cut down on spam in Gmail. The company rolled out the service, which Kim referred to as AI anti-threat defense software, in late 2023 but held off on announcing it until its Next conference so that it had time to use it on its own platform.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We block 20% more spam in Gmail [with the new tool]. We are able to review 1,000 times more user reported spam in Gmail every day,” Kim said. “So that's basically like adding 1,000 cyber defenders to our team.” Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Kim, Google’s effort is like fighting fire with fire. While generative AI apps can be used to generate phishing emails, they can also catch emails created using generative AI, because it can tell what messages were written using the technology.\n\nGoogle isn’t the only company monetizing its generative AI apps. Microsoft is also asking enterprise customers to pony up $30 per month for access to its Copilot for Microsoft 365 platform. It also sells its Copilot for Security service, as well as a host of generative AI-powered features for Azure\n\nAs companies continue rolling out generative AI apps and services, they’ll need to ensure that they not only pay for themselves but also bring in huge amounts of revenue.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "It’s a great time to be looking at transportation stocks to buy. Thanks to the reshoring boom, multinational companies are looking to relocate much of their supply chains and manufacturing capacity back to the United States and the North American free trade zone.\n\nThe pandemic, as well as ensuing logistical and supply chain disruptions, have made it clear that companies should position more of their manufacturing assets in North America. To that point, Mexico overtook China as the United States’ largest trading partner in 2023.\n\nAs that trend grows, it should create greater and greater opportunities for the transportation sector. These are three transportation stocks set to benefit from the reshoring trend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.\n\nSource: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of North America’s class one railroads. It has dominant market share on many routes within the western part of the United States.\n\nIn addition, Union Pacific has been active in the Mexican market for more than 30 years, as it jumped onto that trend just prior to when the NAFTA free trade deal went into effect. Union Pacific also owns more than one-quarter of a leading Mexican railroad, Ferromex, giving it prime exposure to the growing made-in-Mexico movement.\n\nUnion Pacific shares have pulled back over the past month. Investors appear to be concerned about rising interest rates and the possibility of economic slowdown. Those are certainly valid worries.\n\nHowever, with the stock at 21 forward earnings shares after the recent dip, UNP stock is now at a fair price for a tremendous business within the transportation stock sector.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a large transportation and parcel delivery services company. It operates a massive fleet of trucks and airplanes for moving goods and shipments around the country and worldwide.\n\nFedEx has been a significant beneficiary from the growth of e-commerce as people increasingly rely on last mile delivery services to get products to their house. This is a trend which has only accelerated since 2020 as the pandemic led to more online shopping.\n\nThere had been concerns that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would eat into the market share for FedEx and other parcel services. However, it seems that Amazon has dialed back its investments in logistics and fulfillment assets. This suggests that FedEx’s core operational business retains a strong competitive position.\n\nFedEx recently sold off after a weaker-than-expected earnings report where revenues missed expectations. As with Union Pacific, investors are selling FedEx on concerns around interest rates and a potential recession. However, this creates a great buy-the-dip opportunity in FDX stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nForward Air (FWRD) Aircraft parking at airport runway. Airline stocks\n\nSource: Sugrit Jiranarak / Shutterstock.com\n\nForward Air (NASDAQ:FWRD) is an air freight and logistics company. It operates in two segments: Expedited Freight and Intermodal, and provides services such as local pick-up and delivery, less-than-truckload services, intermodal container drayage services and other such items. Forward Air serves various clients such as cargo carriers, freight forwarders, third-party logistics firms, and retailers.\n\nForward Air has historically been successful; shares rose from around $5 at the turn of the century to more than $100 per share recently.\n\nHowever, the company has fallen on hard times thanks to a controversial merger with Omni Logistics. Omni itself was a rollup of several smaller freight companies. Investors are understandably skeptical as to how quickly Forward Air will be able to consolidate Omni’s various businesses. It can take a while to wring out the cost synergies and make a large merger like this successful.\n\nThat said, FRWD stock is down nearly 75% over the past year. It seems investors have panicked and assumed the worst with this Omni transaction despite the company’s strong prior track record. Analysts expect Forward Air to return the strong profitability in 2025, which should set the stage for shares to lift off once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "MELI Stock: Move Over, Amazon. Meet Latin America’s E-Commerce Darling.",
        "content": "Looking for the “next” Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock? Look no further, as MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) could be considered the “Amazon of Latin America.” MercadoLibre stock isn’t cheap, by any means, but it has all the markings of a long-term wealth builder.\n\nLike Amazon, MercadoLibre operates a widely used e-commerce platform. However, MercadoLibre also runs a fintech-services platform called MercadoPago.\n\nLatin America has a population of over 650 million people. An emerging middle class and increasing Internet penetration make Latin America fertile ground for e-commerce opportunities. So, even if you missed out on the multi-year rally in Amazon stock, you can seize a moneymaking moment with MercadoLibre stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSales Growth Justifies MercadoLibre Stock Rally\n\nI’m not going to claim that MercadoLibre stock is cheap. The share price recently hit $1,500. Furthermore, MercadoLibre’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is elevated, at 77.14x.\n\nValue-focused investors might bristle at MercadoLibre’s high multiple. On the other hand, sometimes a company’s sales growth can justify its lofty P/E ratio. After all, Amazon has been richly valued for a long time, yet the stock has made a lot of money for some people.\n\nImpressively, MercadoLibre managed to increase its fourth-quarter 2023 net revenue by 42% year over year to $4.26 billion, thereby beating Wall Street’s call for $4.12 billion. Notably, Mercado Pago, MercadoLibre’s fintech division, posted 34% net-revenue growth.\n\nSo, don’t be surprised if MercadoLibre’s investors continue to grow their wealth despite the high share price. JPMorgan analysts raised their MercadoLibre stock price target from $2,000 to $2,150, and that’s not unrealistic at all, given the company’s sales acceleration.\n\nMercadoLibre: Spending Money to Make Money\n\nWhen a company’s revenue grows rapidly, this enables strategic investment opportunities. In MercadoLibre’s case, the company is pouring large amounts of investable capital into Latin America.\n\nThe numbers, I’ll admit, are jaw-dropping. This year, MercadoLibre plans to invest $380 million in Colombia, $2.45 billion in Mexico and $4.6 billion in Brazil.\n\nWhy would MercadoLibre move so much capital into Brazil? According to Reuters, MercadoLibre “generates more than half of its revenue in Brazil.” Hence, this particular investment makes sense, though $4.6 billion is still a lot of money.\n\nThe company intends to allocate capital toward technology, advertising, product launches and other endeavors. Without a doubt, MercadoLibre’s investment in Latin America will impact the company’s bottom-line results for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, not unlike Amazon, MercadoLibre is making the necessary preparations to develop into a multi-generational e-commerce powerhouse.\n\nMELI Stock: Unlock a Prime Opportunity in Latin America\n\nMercadoLibre’s quarterly sales growth is undeniable, and the shares can still be worth owning even if they’re not cheap. MercadoLibre’s strategic capital allocations could solidify and expand the company’s e-commerce market dominance in Latin America.\n\nThus, investors have a chance to capture the “next” Amazon as MercadoLibre stakes its claim in an important emerging market. In the coming quarters, MELI stock should easily break above $2,000 and then $2,150.\n\nThen, the discussion will turn to stock-split possibilities and the next frontiers for MercadoLibre.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nasdaq just gave former unicorn Allbirds a 6-month warning to raise its stock price or risk getting booted—experts say to look at its B Corp status",
        "content": "Allbirds was once a direct-to-consumer darling, promising a shoe that was not only comfortable and fashionable, but environmentally sustainable, capturing the attention of investors like Leonardo Dicaprio and Warby Parker founder Andrew Hunt. In fact, its social purpose was inextricable from its business model. Now it’s on a six-month warning.\n\nThe San Francisco-based eco-friendly shoe brand received a non-compliance notice from Nasdaq on Monday after its share prices fell below $1 for 30 consecutive days. Hovering around $0.60 per share for the past two weeks, the last time Allbirds stock was above the dollar cutoff for the market’s listing compliance was Feb. 15.\n\nAccording to Nasdaq's listing rules, Allbirds has six months, or until Sept. 30, to regain compliance by having its common stock close at over $1 for 10 consecutive business days. The company said in a press release that it will “actively monitor” stock prices and “consider actions that it may take in response to this notification.”\n\n“Over the past year, under our plan, we significantly improved our business model–cleaned up inventory, captured cost savings, reduced our operating cash use, and signed agreements with international distributors–providing the runway and financial flexibility to continue to execute on our plan and position the Company to drive profitable growth in future years,” an Allbirds spokesperson told Fortune in a statement.\n\nAllbirds’ fiscal 2023 was marred by a near 15% plummet in net revenue and gross profit of $104.2 million that was down 41% compared to $129.6 million in 2022. Last month, COO Joe Vernachio stepped up to helm the company as CEO and implement a “strategic transformation plan” that included closing down 10 to 15 U.S. stores and using a distributor model in international markers, per its fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nAllbirds’ recent struggles highlight the company’s albatross: It has never turned a profit in nine years of business. While the company prioritized its sustainability mission, there’s evidence it came at the expense of actually making money for the company. To understand what’s going on, you need to dive into the world of B Corps.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnvironmentally or economically sustainable?\n\nAllbirds gained B Corp classification—meeting the social and environmental standard set by independent non-profit B Labs—in 2016 at a time when CEOs coveted the certification, wanting to earnestly make a difference through this status that comes with an explicit social mission. There are over 6,000 certified B Corp companies as of 2023, a figure that has tripled since 2016.\n\nOutlined in their Product Carbon Footprint Methodology, Allbirds sources natural materials such as sugarcane and tree fibers, as well as recycled materials to manufacture its shoes. In 2023, the company committed to reduce its per-unit carbon emissions by 95% by 2030. But its environmental pledges haven’t been consistently profitable. Allbirds disclosed in a Dec. 31 SEC filing, that it accumulated $391.2 million in deficit as of the filing’s publication: “We have incurred significant net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.”\n\nWhile hit with a remote work boom that saw decreased demand for work-appropriate footwear, Allbirds ultimately failed to understand its audience: Even though the company’s founder cared about the environment, their target audience really didn’t, Neil Saunders, GlobalData managing director of retail, told RetailDive in March.\n\n“​​Allbirds has pushed the sustainability message because it is a passion of its founder,” he said. “That’s fine, but the passions of individuals are not selling strengths if they are misaligned with the market.”\n\nThe company’s attitude for sustainability above all else was apparent after Amazon introduced Galen wool sneakers in 2019 that cost 50% less. Then-CEO Joey Zwillinger admitted that he wasn’t upset that Amazon adapted a similar design—but he was that Amazon did so without also mimicking Allbirds’ sustainability practices.\n\n“Given what I know about manufacturing, there is no way you can sell a shoe for that low while taking care of all of the environmental and animal welfare considerations and compliance we take into account,” Zwillinger said in an interview with Co.Design in September 2019. “Amazon is stating that it wants to be a green company. It should be taking steps to make their products more sustainable.”\n\nAmazon denied copying Allbirds’ design, saying in 2019 that “This aesthetic isn't limited to Allbirds, and similar products are also offered by several other brands.” The e-commerce giant sells Allbirds on its marketplace.\n\nThe B Corp blues\n\nTo be sure, some B Corp firms have used the certification as a form of virtue signaling, touting commitments to social and environmental causes while also finding ways to cut corners. While Nestlé subsidiary Nespresso gained B Corp certification in 2022, smaller coffee roasters have accused the company of paying its coffee bean farmers a pittance and selling single-serving cups that generate immense waste. Nespresso posted 5.3% organic growth in fiscal 2023.\n\nBut others, as in the case of Allbirds, have held onto their political convictions to, at times, the expense of making money. Ben & Jerry’s, a certified B Corp since 2012, has been parent company Unilever's problem child, as its generated backlash for its social stances, such as refusing to sell ice cream in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and saying the U.S. was “founded on stolen Indigenous land.”\n\nLast month, Unilever decided to restructure the company to separate its ice cream unit, including Ben & Jerry’s, laying off 7,500 mostly office-based employees. The restructuring began immediately and is slated to be completed by 2025.\n\nUnilever and many of its subsidiaries have had B Corp status for years, though not always to the delight of its shareholders. Investors such as Terry Smith, who is behind Unilever’s 10th largest shareholder Fundsmith, long criticized Unilever for its social statements detracting from business.\n\n“A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot,” he wrote in a 2022 letter to investors.\n\nSmith praised the conglomerate’s decision to restructure. In a similar moment of reckoning, Allbirds’ leadership has offered some optimism on the future of the brand. The company revamped its iconic wool sneaker late last year in an effort to go back to basics.\n\n“People love a comeback and I think they love what we stand for,\" Brown told Business Insider in November. \"And now we just have to go execute really well.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Investing in long-term stocks offers an excellent alternative to the frenetic world of day trading. Long-term stocks are about hitching your ride with companies that have stood the test of time, ensuring sustained growth and profitability for their stockholders. The allure of long-term stock picks lies in selecting businesses that exhibit steady growth instead of fizzling out after a short-lived rally.\n\nThe three long-term stocks discussed in the article fit the bill perfectly, boasting timeless business models that will continue rewarding their shareholders for the foreseeable future. These businesses stand out for their strong competitive moats and are positioned for more expansion, backed by impressive growth catalysts that can turn a $100,000 investment into $1 million given a sufficient holding period.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\neCommerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the most prolific growth stocks, gaining over 1000% in value in the past decade. Its tentacles are spread across multiple tech verticals, with a diversified business model that’s second to none. Moreover, its strategic expansion has proven incredibly rewarding for its shareholders, with AMZN stock outpacing broader market gains repeatedly throughout the past decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough it’s known for its pioneering eCommerce business, its true profit engine has been its game-changing cloud computing service in Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS dominates the burgeoning cloud computing market, supporting millions of enterprises on a global scale. In highlighting AWS’s contribution to Amazon’s success, the division’s revenues were up 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $24.2 billion in the fourth-quarter (Q4) of 2023, while the company’s total quarterly sales increased by 14% to $170 billion.\n\nFurthermore, AWS plays a critical role in powering AI technology with its cutting-edge cloud services. Moreover, its extensive resources and tools empower developers and businesses to develop new AI applications, cementing the company’s position at the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nEntertainment juggernaut Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) needs no introduction. Its empire spans enchanting theme parks, blockbuster films, and streaming platforms, making it one of the most diversified entertainment businesses in the world.\n\nThe past few years for Disney have been tricky, though, as it has faced challenges from unsuccessful superhero films to political controversies. Nevertheless, its stock is ticking in the green again, delivering a 30% year-to-date (YTD) gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, there’s plenty that’s going for the business at this time, positioning it for robust gains ahead. It aims to achieve streaming profitability by the tail-end of this year with its powerful direct-to-consumer platforms of Disney+ and ESPN+. ESPN has proven especially lucrative due to growth in ad sales and the incredible success of sports streaming. Additionally, its timeless parks division has recovered from the pandemic-era uncertainty and earned an extra 10% in operating income during Q4. Also, Disney is looking to invest a whopping $30 billion over the next 10 years to bolster its parks division.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the leading players in the cybersecurity industry, and it hasthat’s been delivering exceptional gains for its shareholders over the past few years. Its 3-year return stands at an impressive 54%, while its top-line has grown by more than 70% in the past five years. The mission-critical nature of its business makes it an excellent long-term stock pick, and the integration of AI makes its role even more crucial.\n\nCybersecurity in AI plays a major role in defending AI systems and ensuring data integrity and user trust. It involves the protection of AI algorithms and data from manipulation while maintaining ethical standards of AI applications across multiple sectors. Therefore, modern cybersecurity will have everything to do with AI, and Crowdstrike continues to grow its investments in transformative technology to gain additional market share.\n\nFurthermore, CRWD has been killing it lately with its fundamentals, having bested analysts’ estimates across both lines in each of the four quarters last year. It generated upwards of $3 billion in annual recurring revenues while reporting a 33% YOY increase in Q4.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Hydrogen Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "Green hydrogen, which refers to using renewable energy to create hydrogen, is spreading fairly rapidly around the world. Green hydrogen predominantly decarbonizes carbon-heavy industries that are difficult to fully electrify, such as steel production and chemicals. The EU recently approved Germany’s 2.2 billion euro initiative to decarbonize industry with green hydrogen and electrification. In Brazil, over 60 deals related to green hydrogen have been signed. U.S. electrical products maker, ABB and Green Hydrogen International recently partnered to build a plant that will generate 280,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. Bloomberg predicts that by 2030, green hydrogen could cost less than natural gas-fueled hydrogen, even without tax credits. Here are three undervalued hydrogen stocks to buy now.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nHydrogen fuel cell maker Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is changing hands for a rather low price/sales ratio of 1.9 times. Analysts expect its revenue to jump 11% this year and another 24% in 2025. Those figures alone make it one of the most undervalued hydrogen stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO KR Sridhar recently noted that the U.S.’s electricity demand is expected to accelerate up to ten-fold in the coming years. However, the country’s current electric grid is unable to handle this increased demand. After in-depth talks with data centers, Bloom is poised to benefit. These centers believe that BE’s electricity-producing fuel cells are their best option when it comes to alternative power solutions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, a number of utilities and multiple industrial firms are interested in the company’s newer products.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) has a highly profitable industrial gas business. It is also building two clean hydrogen plants to boost the company’s long-term top and bottom lines.\n\nLinde has also already obtained a large customer for the clean hydrogen plant that it’s launching in Texas. OCI agreed to buy hydrogen and nitrogen from Linde for its Texas ammonia plant.\n\nDespite Linde’s potent combination of current profits and future, positive catalysts from clean hydrogen, LIN stock has a low enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 19.3 times.\n\nMeanwhile, Linde expects its earnings per share to jump 8% to 11% this year, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) lost a great deal of money on the hydrogen that it delivered to its customers. But Plug is building its own green hydrogen plants and says that it can churn out green hydrogen for $3 to $5 per kilogram. Historically, the firm has been able to sell the fuel for roughly $6 to $7 per kilogram, but it noted earlier this year that it was raising the prices that it charges for its hydrogen. Moreover, PLUG says that Washington is preparing to provide tax credits of up to $3 per kilogram for green hydrogen.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo PLUG’s gross margin for the green hydrogen that it produces could exceed $7 per kilogram in some cases and will be over $1 per kilogram at the lowest. Moreover, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have committed to buying huge amounts of green hydrogen from Plug starting in 2025. Given these points, I believe that the production of green hydrogen will become a big profit generator for PLUG by the end of next year.\n\nAdditionally, in late 2025, Plug Power is likely to start getting sizable deals to provide backup and supplemental electricity to data centers.\n\nThese catalysts make Plug’s current market capitalization of $2.1 billion low, making it one of the best undervalued hydrogen stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in PLUG. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has single-handedly taken the stock market to new heights in the past year. However, the top AI stocks to buy have taken a breather in the past few weeks. Given the monstrous gains last year, many had predicted a more volatile second half of 2024 for AI stocks. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to abandon AI stocks hastily, given the market’s massive long-term potential.\n\nThat said, investing in the right AI stocks is likely to prove incredibly lucrative over time. In the past year, these three stocks discussed in the article have cumulatively added more than $600 billion in market value, with each witnessing at least a 50% jump in market capitalization. The amazing bump in value shows the significant impact of AI initiatives on their growth trajectories.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has arguably been the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution, with its market cap soaring more than 50% last year. With its comprehensive approach to integrating AI across its business, MSFT has positioned itself for tremendous long-term expansion ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt all started with its hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, a collaboration spearheading the industry. Moreover, MSFT has effectively layered AI throughout its product offerings, which has already paid dividends for its business. Its recent performances reflect that notion, where in the past four consecutive quarters, it outperformed analyst estimates by $1.35 billion on average.\n\nFurthermore, it’s looking to monetize AI through its innovative new products, such as the Microsoft Copilot. With a subscription model for Copilot, the company expects a massive revenue boost, potentially adding more than $25 billion in incremental sales by 2025.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft’s AI initiatives effectively complement its powerful business units, such as its cloud-computing arm in Azure. Azure’s recent growth continues to outpace the company’s overall sales, and AI will likely cement the platform’s position among the ‘cloud czars’.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon building at night time with logo light up on building\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI exploits are often overshadowed by its colossal retail empire and diverse business ventures. Its cloud computing behemoth, Amazon Web Services (AWS), plays a critical role in enabling the development of powerful AI applications that help improve customer engagement, streamline operations and foster innovation. Moreover, AWS provides the necessary firepower to run AI applications, offering a variety of industry-leading services and tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the eCommerce titan has strategically invested in Anthropic, one of the most promising AI labs advancing generative AI technologies. In fact, Anthropic claims that its Claude AI large language model (LLM) can beat the leading chatbots in ChatGPT and Gemini Pro across multiple benchmarks. Amazon hopes to leverage Anthropic’s transformative potential to help position AWS at the forefront of the public cloud market for years to come. Consequently, analysts at Tipranks, assign a ‘strong buy’ rating to AMZN stock, predicting a 12% upside from current price levels.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nChip-making giant Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is one of the most important companies that are advancing the AI industry. It develops the software critical to the development of semiconductor chips powering AI products and services. Over the years, it has positioned itself as a leader in the burgeoning electronic design automation (EDA) space, targeting semiconductor development.\n\nEven before AI went mainstream, Synopsys was generating millions in profits, with revenues growing by double-digit margins. Now, with AI reshaping technology, the company is poised for a tremendous boost as it leverages its EDA expertise to meet the evolving AI demands.\n\nFurthermore, it’s looking to expand its market share further with its $35 billion acquisition of Ansys. Driven by AI demands, the merger effectively combines Synopsys’s semiconductor design expertise with Ansys’s simulation capabilities, a combo that could take SNPS stock to new heights.\n\nSNPS stock attracts a ‘strong buy’ rating from Wall-Street analysts, who expect a 12.50% upside from current prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Unlike short-term trades, long-term investing harnesses the power of time and compound growth.\n\nIt requires both patience and a selective eye, favoring companies with sound fundamentals and strong growth prospects over fleeting trends. Identifying those stocks that will reward investors over decades is the key to building wealth in the stock market. With careful analysis, investors can position their investment portfolios for sustained prosperity over the long haul.\n\nNow, let’s discover the three most promising long-term stocks to snap up in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) should be at the top of your buy list when considering the most promising long-term stocks to buy in 2024. The company is making serious strides in artificial intelligence (AI), and its growth in Google Search and YouTube should not be ignored.\n\nGoogle holds a powerful position in search giving the company a massive advertising revenue engine. It holds more than 90% search engine market share, making it well-positioned to capitalize on the tailwinds in generative AI. The company also has a treasure trove of data, fueled for AI development that could further bolster its revenue and market share. Additionally, Alphabet continues to advance its LLM, Gemini Ultra, which boasts superior capabilities over its competition. But what got investors excited is GOOG’s recent announcement of its new Arm-based AI CPU. This will be a game-changer, set to compete directly with Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) custom chips for advanced AI applications.\n\nWalmart (WMT) WMT Stock\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock helped revolutionize retail with its ‘’everyday low prices’’ model and sprawling supercenters. Despite its size, the company has adapted well to changing dynamics, pushing aggressively into e-commerce and other omni channels.\n\nWalmart’s robust and diversified business model serves as a solid foundation for long-term growth and stability. As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart operates a vast network of stores catering to a wide range of consumer needs. The approach helps mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in any single segment of the retail industry. Furthermore, its pricing power and sheer scale of operations, both physical and online, are a huge competitive advantage. In Q4 FY24, revenue accelerated 5.7% year-over-year (YOY), with operating income up 30.4% for the quarter. Global e-commerce sales were up 23%, surpassing $100 billion for the first time. With a recent 9% hike in WMT’s annual dividend, the stock remains one of the best long-term stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE), known for its green and yellow tractors, is a force in agricultural and construction equipment. The agricultural sector is vital for maintaining human life and is relatively a safe haven stock for more conservative investors.\n\nDeere has delivered strong top and bottom-line growth over the last 3 years, driven by strong demand for agricultural equipment. The company has averaged about 20% revenue growth and 63% EPS growth over the same period. It remains well-positioned to benefit from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, as well as the long-term growth of global infrastructure spending.\n\nFurthermore, Deere’s strong cash flow generation and high return on equity (ROE) demonstrate its ability to effectively manage shareholder equity to drive profitable growth. The company has also shown a commitment to returning cash to shareholders, showcased by its 10% CAGR in its dividend over the last decade. That makes DE stock one of the best promising long-term stocks set to make early investors rich.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon Grows To Over 750,000 Robots As World's Second-Largest Private Employer Replaces Over 100,000 Humans\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is rapidly advancing its use of robotics, deploying over 750,000 robots to work alongside its employees.\n\nThe world's second-largest private employer employs 1.5 million people. While that's a lot, it's a decrease of over 100,000 employees from the 1.6 million workers it had in 2021. Meanwhile, the company had 520,000 robots in 2022 and 200,000 robots in 2019. While Amazon is bringing on hundreds of thousands of robots per year, the company is slowly decreasing its employee numbers.\n\nThe robots, including new models like Sequoia and Digit, are designed to perform repetitive tasks, thereby improving efficiency, safety and delivery speed for Amazon‘s customers. Sequoia, for example, speeds up inventory management and order processing in fulfillment centers, while Digit, a bipedal robot developed in collaboration with Agility Robotics, handles tasks like moving empty tote boxes.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share. Invest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\n\nThe significant investment in robotics showcases Amazon’s commitment to innovation in its supply chain and highlights the company’s belief in the synergistic potential of human-robot collaboration. Despite the massive scale of automation, Amazon emphasizes that deploying robots has led to the creation of new skilled job categories at the company, reflecting a broader industry trend toward the integration of advanced technologies with human workforces.\n\nAmazon's deployment of over 750,000 robots represents a significant move toward automation at the world's second-largest employer. The shift has the potential to significantly impact job dynamics within the company and beyond. While Amazon asserts that robots are meant to work collaboratively with human employees, assisting them with repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and workplace safety, concerns about job displacement and the implications for the workforce are inevitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s integration of robots like Sequoia and Digit into its fulfillment centers is part of its broader strategy to enhance its supply chain operations through advanced technologies. The robots are designed to streamline operations and ensure faster delivery times to customers. The company emphasizes that robotic solutions support workplace safety and allow it to offer a wider range of products for same-day or next-day delivery.\n\nTrending: Invest alongside exec’s from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\n\nThe introduction of such a large number of robots into the workforce raises questions about the future role of human labor in Amazon’s operational model. The impact on jobs, particularly tasks that are highly repetitive and could be easily automated, is a concern for many. Research from institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has shown that industrial robots have a significant negative impact on workers, affecting jobs and wages in the areas where they are deployedâ€‹. The broader discussion on the economic and political consequences of automation highlights widespread fears of job displacement and the potential for increased income inequality.\n\nDespite these concerns, Amazon has pointed out the creation of 700 categories of skilled job types that previously didn't exist at the company, suggesting that automation can also lead to the creation of new types of employment opportunities. This evolution within Amazon’s workforce could reflect a shift in the nature of work where human employees move toward more complex, nonrepetitive tasks that require higher levels of skill and creativity.\n\nAmazon could serve as a microcosm for broader trends in the economy, where the integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and the labor market. The challenge for Amazon, and society at large, will be to navigate these changes in ways that maximize the benefits of automation while mitigating negative impacts on employment and ensuring that the gains from increased productivity are shared broadly across the workforce.\n\nRead About Startup Investing:\n\nThis ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.

        "title": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the benefits of AI 'will astound us all'",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy is finally going all in on generative AI. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, the Amazon chief said the technology is the company’s next major product opportunity, up there with Marketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nJassy also laid out why Amazon is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of generative AI, explaining how the company has all of the pieces in place to be the go-to tech firm for both enterprise customers’ and consumers’ generative AI needs.\n\n“The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all,” Jassy wrote in his letter. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.”\n\nAmazon has kept a relatively low profile when it comes to generative AI compared to the likes Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which have spent the last year boasting about their AI offerings and debuting new generative AI-powered products and services.\n\nBut Amazon has been investing heavily in the technology, including pouring $4 billion into AI startup Anthropic, which has become a kind of flagship offering for the company akin to how Microsoft positions its relationship with OpenAI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during the New York Times DealBook Summit in the Appel Room at the Jazz At Lincoln Center on November 30, 2022 . (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nNow, Jassy seems ready to push Amazon as a major generative AI player like its rivals. That includes laying out the company’s approach to the technology from the chips used to train and run AI models to apps like its Rufus chatbot for Amazon’s Marketplace and Amazon Q, which writes and debugs code for AWS users.\n\nIn his letter, Jassy touted Amazon’s investments in its Graviton CPU chips, as well as its Trainium chip for training AI models and Inferentia chip for inferencing those models, as key offerings that set Amazon apart from the competition. Inferencing refers to using AI models to complete tasks.\n\nAnd while Jassy said that Amazon offers a vast array of Nvidia (NVDA) chips to its customers for training and deploying AI models, he positioned Amazon’s chips as viable alternatives that can meet customers’ needs at a time when Nvidia’s chips are in short supply and the price to run AI models soars.\n\nStory continues\n\nJassy also appeared to take a shot at his Big Tech rivals when it comes to the AI models themselves, saying that Amazon offers models from a slew of companies including Anthropic, Stability AI, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, and Amazon’s own models, rather than just one major AI model. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“Customers don’t want only one model,” Jassy said. “They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications.”\n\nWhile Microsoft and Google offer multiple AI models to their enterprise customers, the companies have spent much of their time hyping their respective AI platforms. Microsoft regularly points to its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI as a major factor that differentiates it from other Big Tech firms, while Google is focused on rolling out and hyping its Gemini foundation models.\n\nJassy also pointed to Amazon’s efforts to build its own generative AI apps including its Amazon Q platform for AWS developers and Rufus chatbot. I used an early version of Rufus, and while I found it helpful in some respects, it’s also still prone to errors when answering some queries.\n\nNow that Amazon is going full force into the generative AI realm, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft and Google respond. We’ll find out more when both companies host their respective developer conferences next month.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

His tenure has been characterized by rolling layoffs, cost cuts and product shutdowns as the company adjusted to slower growth coming out of the pandemic. That differentiates him from Bezos, who plowed revenue into moonshot projects in between bouts of frugality.\n\nThe company began cutting hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services division, Bloomberg News reported earlier in April. In his letter, Jassy said AWS will be at the core of AI applications and models and “help democratize this next seminal phase of AI.”\n\nJassy has focused the company’s investments on a few big initiatives such as building data centers to help fuel the artificial intelligence boom and efforts to develop build out an Amazon franchise in groceries and health care. Those were the focus of his letter a year ago. In his first letter to investors as Amazon boss, he pledged to reduce injury rates among the company’s workers.\n\n“AI may be largest technology transformation since the cloud” or possibly the internet, he said in the most recent missive. “The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon also added artificial intelligence expertise to its board.

While many investors seek to find a winning stock, it’s best to diversify your holdings across numerous assets. This has led to this list of top stocks to buy.\n\nSpreading your money across multiple stocks minimizes your risk. You also have the opportunity to generate higher long-term returns. It’s good to shop around for stocks even when you feel content with your portfolio. Always reviewing investment ideas allows you to capitalize on great deals when they arrive.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of publicly traded corporations. However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta’s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a “Moderate Buy” with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it’s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It’s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company’s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company’s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle’s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a 50-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a “Strong Buy” rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company’s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don’t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a “Strong Buy.” The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

        "content": "Amazon is adding artificial intelligence visionary Andrew Ng to its board of directors, a move that comes amid intense AI competition among startups and big technology companies.\n\nThe Seattle company said Thursday that Ng, a managing director at the Palo Alto, California-based AI Fund, will replace a seat vacated by Judy McGrath, a former CEO of MTV who told Amazon she won't run for reelection.\n\nNg's AI Fund, which he founded in 2017, invests in entrepreneurs building artificial intelligence companies. Previously, he led AI teams at the Chinese tech company Baidu and Google, where the team he oversaw taught a computer system to recognize cats in YouTube videos without ever being taught what a cat was.\n\nNg's addition to the board comes as Amazon, like other tech companies, makes massive investments in generative artificial intelligence. The company has invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based startup Anthropic, which is partnering with Amazon to develop so-called foundation models that underpin generative AI technologies. In the past year, Amazon also rolled out a chatbot for businesses called Q and a generative-AI powered shopping assistant named Rufus.\n\nIn an annual shareholder letter released Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested generative AI could be the next big pillar of Amazon's business, joining the company's prominent online marketplace, Prime subscription program and its cloud computing unit, AWS. Jassy wrote that generative AI may be the largest technological transformation since cloud computing, and “perhaps since the internet.”\n\nMeanwhile, other Amazon innovations have encountered some hiccups. The company said last week it was pulling its Just Walk Out technology from Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. after receiving some customer feedback. Amazon said it was replacing the technology, which allows customers to skip the checkout line, with smart carts that would allow them still to do that but also see their spending in real time.",

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Decades of Consistent Returns",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are finally cycling back into portfolios after a few years’ worth of higher interest rates put fixed-income options ahead of dividend distribution yield for income investors. As those investors circle back toward dividend stocks, a few things have changed about how to best look at the many available offerings – but that’s true for most stock segments today.\n\nFor example, today’s growth-minded investors demand stronger financial and fundamental credentials compared to the ZIRP era, when any company forecasting significant future profits could easily attract investor funds. That sentiment generally held no matter the company’s underlying financial management (or lack thereof). Investors now exercise more caution, shying away from speculative stocks with a more discerning eye.\n\nThis change also applies to dividend stocks, though in a somewhat opposite manner. While seeking greater stability in growth stocks, investors expect long-term growth potential from their value investments. Although short-term Treasuries still offer a yield of over 5%, income-producing stocks need to provide either a higher yield, the prospect of long-term capital gains, – or both – if they want to stand out from the pack.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nWe may be rounding the corner on tax season, but H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is now a top dividend stock to buy year-round. Breaking free from tax software’s inherently cyclical nature, H&R Block is increasingly looking to diversify revenue streams to keep cash coming in no matter the month.\n\nTo counter the tax sector’s seasonal nature, H&R Block launched a mobile banking service, which saw quick success and continued growth momentum. H&R Block’s latest report reveals over $456 million in net customer deposits and a total of 316,000 customer signups. Additionally, H&R Block is keen on leveraging new technologies for more efficient tax filing, working on an AI-powered tax assistance product alongside industry-heavyweight Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe appeal of H&R Block as a must-buy dividend stock is further solidified by its impressive total yield of 11.5%. This substantial yield, backed by a modest 33% payout ratio, indicates that H&R Block retains a considerable portion of its earnings for growth initiatives while still providing significant rewards to its shareholders.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently tops lists of dividend stocks to buy now, and for good reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty’s Dividend Aristocrat status, monthly distributions, and Treasury Bill-beating 5.65% yield make it a favorite among income and dividend investors. Despite its 7% dip since January and 13% loss over the past year, Realty Income’s fundamental strength remains solid, offering an excellent opportunity for long-term investors focused on wealth accumulation.\n\nThe company boasts a high occupancy rate exceeding 98% across its portfolio, with 80% of its retail tenants operating within recession-resilient industries. Realty Income’s triple-net lease model transfers all operational risks and costs, including property maintenance expenses, to its tenants, shielding the company from rising materials and labor costs. Additionally, it enjoys the stability of long-term leases, with an average length exceeding 15 years and an active average lease duration sitting close to ten years.\n\nBeyond its core focus, Realty Income is pursuing growth opportunities, notably through a recent sale-leaseback deal with the French company Decathlon SE. This strategy, combined with Realty Income’s growth potential, relatively low share price, and status as a dividend aristocrat, positions the dividend stock as a top pick in today’s market.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Realty Income, AT&T (NYSE:T) remains a must-buy dividend stock, even after losing its Dividend Aristocrat status in 2022. AT&T distinguishes itself with a forward-thinking approach and continues to innovate as it matures in the market.\n\nOne growth initiative is AT&T’s substantial investment in AST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) plan to launch satellite-based cellular services, targeting a commercial launch later in 2024. While not immediately transformative for AT&T, this venture demonstrates the company’s readiness to explore new growth avenues and stay competitive in a crowded market.\n\nAT&T’s late January earnings release revealed some missed targets but highlighted strong growth areas, including nearly 4% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenue. This growth signifies AT&T’s success in overcoming economic hurdles to maintain and expand its customer base with strategic pricing. Notably, AT&T added 526,000 postpaid phone subscribers, surpassing the expected 487,500, showcasing its competitive edge in a tough market.\n\nDespite criticisms of being a yield trap, AT&T upholds a 6.73% dividend yield with a manageable 56% payout ratio, making it an appealing choice for investors focused on dividends.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s tough to beat Warren Buffett when it comes to value investing, and one dividend stock he currently loves is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). With an 18% payout ratio delivering a 3.85% total yield, the stock offers considerable benefits for both income and growth-focused investors.\n\nBuffett significantly increased his investment in OXY throughout the past few years, especially in 2023, eventually securing a 27% ownership in the oil and gas company valued at over $14.5 billion. He also holds warrants that could increase his stake to 33%. And, though Occidental Petroleum has a range of net-zero and sustainability-focused initiatives, it still stands to benefit from higher crude oil pricing that’s currently creeping into markets.\n\nOver the past few months, OXY’s share price usually fluctuated between $55 and $65. But, partially on its own merits and partially due to crude price surges, Occidental Petroleum shares are closing in on new 5-year highs. It isn’t too late to ride Buffett’s coattails on this dividend stock pick, though, as it remains a unique growth play within a mature industry.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRecent telecom turbulence tested many established companies, including dividend aristocrat Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Despite this, Verizon showcases significant long-term potential for investors seeking reliable dividend stocks for long-term holding.\n\nThe primary cause of the stock’s suppression was last summer’s lead shielding scandal, which ultimately impacted telecom companies’ financial performance less than initially feared. However, Verizon’s shares have yet to rebound fully. The stock has remained relatively stagnant over the last year, with a mere 3.8% return, starkly contrasting to the S&P 500’s 21% gain during the same timeframe.\n\nVerizon’s latest earnings report reflects continuous growth, promising capital gains alongside dividend income for investors. The company reported a remarkable increase of 16.9% in postpaid phone additions in the most recent quarter compared to the previous year, marking its strongest performance in four years. Such significant expansion in the mature telecom industry suggests Verizon is effectively capturing market share from competitors and optimizing its marketing strategy.\n\nWith a current yield of just under 6.5%, some may view Verizon as a value trap for similar reasons to AT&T. But the company’s per-share pricing dips, coupled with promising growth indicators, position it as a prime choice among dividend stocks for long-term investment.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Now: Walmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT), the global leader in supermarket and general merchandise retail, ranks as a must-consider option among undervalued dividend stocks due to its widespread popularity and resilience in economic downturns.\n\nOperating over 11,500 stores across 27 countries, Walmart boasts strategic proximity to 90% of the U.S. population within 10 miles, establishing itself as a primary choice for consumers seeking budget-friendly options.\n\nThe appeal of Walmart as a dividend stock stems from its longstanding distribution track record. Since initiating dividends in March 1974 at 5 cents per share, the company now offers a 1.88% total yield, demonstrating an average annual growth rate of 8% across the last five decades, a testament to its performance through various economic cycles.\n\nWalmart’s ability to secure favorable prices from suppliers due to its large scale and pass these savings onto customers underpins its success. Despite the challenge posed by Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) dominance in the online marketplace, Walmart has emerged as a formidable eComm competitor. This sales stream will likely keep growing in popularity, particularly as we start edging toward summer sales season again.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe medical stock sector experienced dramatic fluctuations during and after the pandemic. Understandably, investors became wary of the significant surges and declines in company stocks, casting a shadow over the industry. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a leading MedTech stock, saw its market cap fall by nearly a third post-pandemic. However, recent indicators suggest a robust recovery, and its 3.5% yield continues to satisfy investors during the wait for a rebound. At the same time, investors can rest easy with Medtronic’s dividend program, as it consistently raised its annual dividend for nearly 50 years.\n\nBut, in the medical device industry, Medtronic’s impact goes beyond the financial. The company is celebrated for its innovation and advancements in medical technology and is now shifting towards more collaborative and risk-based contracts with hospital networks. These agreements aim to improve patient outcomes and lower expenses, positioning Medtronic as a crucial ally in a time when healthcare delivery costs are rising. Concurrently, ongoing collaborations with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) position Medtronic at the cutting edge of health technology trends, solidifying its status as a long-term dividend stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "Generally, a buyer's appetite for something would decline as the price rises. But that's one of the many ways the stock market defies normal conventions.\n\nOften, demand for a stock increases after a rally -- and falls following a period of underperformance. In other words, a stock gets less popular as it becomes cheaper, and more popular as its price increases.\n\nThat oddness is partly because investors have a habit of chasing performance, which isn't a great strategy if you're looking to boost your long-term returns. Still, some stocks are rallying for excellent reasons, and their prices don't fully reflect all the positive operating momentum in the business.\n\nLet's look at two good examples. I'd buy Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) right now, even though they have trounced the market over the past year.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon shares are up 80% in the past full year and have gained over 20% in 2024 alone. Yet the stock could still be undervalued.\n\nSure, this member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" has been caught up in the market euphoria around artificial intelligence (AI). Wall Street loves the tech giant's exposure to enterprise cloud services growth, especially given that it is backed up by a large but barely profitable e-commerce segment -- at least compared to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit. This segment generated $7.2 billion of operating profit last quarter, up from $5.2 billion a year ago.\n\nShares don't seem expensive given the strong sales and earnings growth that Amazon is putting up. You can buy the stock for 3.3x revenue, which is still well below the pandemic-high valuation that investors saw in 2021. Brace for volatility ahead, but consider keeping Amazon in your portfolio for the long term.\n\n2. Costco\n\nIt's a retailer, yet it's rallying like a tech stock right now. Costco, the big-box retailing titan, is up sharply in the past year and trouncing industry rivals like Walmart and Target. I'm still bullish on this popular stock following its recent rally, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's because Costco is attracting more customers to its stores, thanks to its price-leadership selling approach. Customer traffic was up a healthy 4% last quarter.\n\nShoppers are flocking to the company's online sales channel that tilts toward more discretionary purchases (like consumer electronics and home furnishings). Wins in both areas allowed second-quarter sales to rise 6% to $57 billion.\n\nCostco won't thrill you with huge sales gains in any short-term period, and most Wall Street pros expect revenue to rise by less than 5% this fiscal year. Investors should temper their expectations around earnings gains, as well. Costco routinely converts just 3% of sales into operating profit, compared to Walmart's 4% and Target's 5%.\n\nBut the business is primed for long-term success. Its customers are highly engaged, as you can see by Costco's membership renewal rate that's sitting at a record high of 92%. This elevated level will also make it easier for the company to pass along its next membership-fee hike at some point this year.\n\nWatch for most of the financial gains from this move to flow into Costco's price cuts rather than spark an immediate earnings improvement. Yet the chain will still get major financial benefits from the increased fees, which constitute most of its annual earnings haul.\n\nThat selling approach means Costco's profits are far more stable than those of its peers and can grow through the ups and downs of the economy. That stability is valuable -- and why investors should consider owning this consumer staples stock, even after its recent rally.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Alphyn Capital Management, an investment management firm, released its first-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Master Account of the fund returned 7.1% net in the first quarter compared to 10.6% for the S&P500 Index. As of March 31, 2024, the top ten holdings accounted for approximately 66% of the portfolio, and approximately 8.2% of the portfolio was held in cash. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management featured stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products and subscriptions. On April 10, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $185.95 per share. One-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 4.03%, and its shares gained 81.59% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.93 trillion.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"My previous analysis (Q4 2022 letter) highlighted the significant growth in Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment expenses since 2015, masking the true earnings potential of its retail business. Though initially costly, the recent restructuring into regional fulfillment centers has yielded lower fulfillment costs and faster shipping times, leading to increased purchase frequency, especially among Prime members.\n\nFollowing the regionalization effort, over the last couple of years, Amazon prioritized cost control and reduced capital expenditures. At a high level, the North American segment's operating income swung from a $240 million loss in 2022 to a healthy $6.4 billion profit (6% margin) in 2023. Combined with continued strength in AWS and advertising, Amazon's free cash flow (as reported, excluding equipment finance leases and principal repayments) surged from negative $13 billion to positive $36 billion.\n\nAmazon stands out for pioneering the public market strategy of prioritizing long-term growth through sustained low margins and reinvestment, with the ability to later \"turn on the taps\" for profit. While many public tech companies have tried to replicate this approach, Amazon's scale and execution capabilities make it one of the few that have successfully pulled it off.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in second position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. At the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was held by 293 hedge fund portfolios, up from 286 in the previous quarter, according to our database.\n\nWe discussed Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "3 Stocks Wall Street Is Ignoring (But You Shouldn’t): April Edition",
        "content": "If you think about it, many of today’s high-flying stocks were once ignored by the Street. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a struggling video-game chip maker, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was a fledgling online book seller and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a formerly successful PC maker, fighting to stay in business. Indeed, the Street tends to shun stocks with great potential that are not yet delivering huge revenue gains or impressive partnerships. Therefore, it’s certainly worthwhile for long-term investors to consider buying stocks that are largely being shunned by the most popular business-news pundits and the largest investors. Here are three such overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nEisai (ESAIY) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Street is still not enthusiastic about Japanese drug maker Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESAIY), co-owner of the first-ever Alzheimer’s treatment, Leqembi, that has shown a significant amount of effectiveness.\n\nAccording to data reported late last year, 60% of a small group of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients who received the drug meaningfully improved. Among a larger group of patients with varied stages of the disease, cognitive decline was slowed by 27%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor a variety of logistics-related reasons, the uptake of the drug has been slower than expected. Neurologists have been unenthusiastic about the treatment. Insurers’ reluctance and IV-only delivery likely explains physicians’ reticence.\n\nThankfully, Eisai has begun seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous version of Leqembi which should ease the drug’s administration. Additionally, Eisai’s U.S. partner, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), is reportedly working to increase insurance coverage of the treatment.\n\nIn spite of the problems, Eisai predicts that the drug will generate almost $2 billion in sales by fiscal year 2027 and $8 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2031.\n\nEntain (GMVHY) sports betting stocks man celebrating winning bet on match, bookmaker app\n\nSource: Motortion Films / Shutterstock.com\n\nEntain (OTCMKTS:GMVHY), a UK-based online betting giant, delivered strong financial results in 2023. It also may greatly benefit from selling a stake in a joint venture to MGM (NYSE:MGM) and could itself become a takeover target.\n\nLast year, Entain’s revenue climbed 11% to 4.77 billion British pounds, while its operating profit, excluding certain items, jumped 18% to 641.8 million British pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Entain and MGM’s joint venture, BetMGM, rose 36% last year, and the joint venture generated positive EBITDA in the second half of the year. BetMGM’s revenue and EBITDA are likely to climb tremendously as the platform expands to more states and as the popularity of online betting spreads in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have been rumors that MGM would look to buy Entain’s stake in BetMGM. If that does occur, Entain would likely have several billion dollars of cash that it could return to shareholders or use to acquire a profitable firm.\n\nFurther, the London Times recently reported that private equity firms are interested in buying Entain. If that occurs, of course, the company’s shares would soar.\n\nAll of Entain’s positive catalysts make it one of the best overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nStem (STEM) Conceptual background of artificial intelligence, humans and cyber-business on programming technology element, 3D illustration. Next trillion-dollar companies. top AI stocks billionaires buy\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nStem’s (NYSE:STEM) AI-powered software maximizes the efficiency of electricity use. The electrification of transportation and the rapid proliferation of AI should cause Stem’s software demand to surge going forward.\n\nStem recently launched PowerBidder Pro to help energy traders and asset owners optimize their asset bids and manage risk. It also enables them, using AI, to predict their energy usage. The product appears to be geared to the owners of energy storage batteries, a sector that’s rapidly growing in America.\n\nEncouragingly, Stem already obtained a major customer and leading independent energy and commodity group,Mercuria, for PowerBidder Pro. Mercuria’s decision to purchase the product so soon after its launch bodes well for its outlook.\n\nStem expects to generate $50 million of cash this year, making it a prime choice among overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in STEM, ESAIY and MGM.

        "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $300 Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett became one of the world's best-known investors through his long track record of consistency. Since 1965, his portfolio has earned an average yearly gain of 20%, approximately double that of the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, with Buffett now in his 90s, many investment decisions are in the hands of his lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. This has changed the philosophy of Berkshire Hathaway a bit, and to that end, it incorporates more growth stocks.\n\nConsequently, investors -- even with a modest budget of $300 -- can find some intriguing growth stocks in the Berkshire portfolio that could deliver market-beating returns over time.\n\nAmazon\n\nBerkshire did not buy Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) until 2019. As to why it took so long to buy, Buffett said he was \"too dumb\" to buy Amazon earlier. He was long skeptical of tech stocks but, in time, came to realize the staying power of such businesses.\n\nNow, Amazon is the world's second-largest retailer, according to the National Retail Federation. Moreover, it pioneered the cloud computing business through Amazon Web Services (AWS), a segment that now accounts for most of the company's operating income.\n\nAdditionally, it operates fast-growth businesses such as digital advertising, online seller services, and its subscription service, known to the public as Amazon Prime. They helped generate revenue of $575 billion in 2023, a 12% increase from last year. This made it a highly diversified business that investors can buy for around $185 per share right now.\n\nAdmittedly, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44 may appear expensive, considering that investors often associate Buffett with finding bargains. Still, investors should remember that Amazon has always sold at a high multiple, and the portfolio has sought more expensive stocks since Buffett handed off some investment decisions to others.\n\nUltimately, with a comparatively reasonable valuation and its diverse business lines, it should remain a stock that serves Buffett and other investors well.\n\nStory continues\n\nNu Holdings\n\nNuBank parent Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU) is one of the world's largest online banks, but since it only operates in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, it is likely not on the radar of most investors. Nonetheless, it probably should be, and not just because Berkshire was an early investor in this business.\n\nNu presents a unique opportunity since just a few institutions had previously dominated banking in this region. For that reason, a large percentage of the population did not have a bank account or credit card. Nu has changed this by issuing the first credit card to millions of Brazilians. Now, 53% of all adult Brazilians (88 million of Nu's 94 million customers) have at least one account with Nu.\n\nAdditionally, the company is now repeating this formula in Mexico and Colombia, meaning its rapid growth can continue. So fast is this growth that the company's $8 billion in revenue for 2023 grew 68% over the previous year.\n\nMoreover, with the stock at around $12 per share, investors can not only buy a few shares with a $300 budget but also buy at levels just above its IPO price from late 2021. Furthermore, at a forward P/E ratio of 31, the shares are priced reasonably when considering the outsized revenue growth of this fintech stock.\n\nDaVita\n\nDaVita (NYSE: DVA) is probably not a company most investors think of as a growth stock. It offers kidney dialysis to more than 200,000 patients in the U.S. and 10 other countries.\n\nHowever, the need for such services never disappears, making it the type of business that has always drawn Buffett's attention. Additionally, approximately 10,000 baby boomers age into Medicare every day, and chronic kidney disease affects about 34% of U.S. adults aged 65 or older. While that may serve as a warning to watch one's kidney health, it also means a growing customer base for DaVita as kidney disease rises.\n\nAdmittedly, considering that its 2023 revenue of $12 billion grew by only 5%, it may not look like much of a \"growth\" business. Nonetheless, the stock has been in a state of recovery as excess deaths (due to COVID-19) and missed appointments weighed on its performance for most of 2022, and rising labor costs have remained an ongoing challenge.\n\nMoreover, analysts expect its cost-cutting to boost net income by 21% in 2024. Thus, considering its P/E ratio is around 18, the stock is arguably a bargain. Also, with the stock trading at about $135 per share as of the time of this writing, investors with a $300 budget can afford its shares. Investors who follow Buffett's lead will likely continue to profit from this healthcare stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The U.S. economy is currently navigating potential risks of a recession. Yet, the broader labor market’s strength has been a significant factor in averting recessionary pressures. This strength stems from businesses competing for workers during a labor shortage, leading to a reluctance to lay off staff even as signs of labor market weakness emerge. The Federal Reserve’s cautious approach reflects a strategy aimed at sustaining economic stability amid ongoing uncertainties. Given that we see some uncertainty when it comes to market performance, you should invest in these top blue-chip stocks that will ensure, growth even during economic turmoil.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American global enterprise that dominates the e-commerce market.\n\nThe company boasted a strong Q4 2023, as it did in previous quarters. AMZN brought in $169.96 billion in revenue. This is a YOY increase of 13.91%. Furthermore, revenue was above consensus industry estimates by 2.23%. However, the most prominent strength of AMZN’s financials was its net income and diluted EPS. These marked astonishing YOY gross of 3721.58% and 4950%, respectively.\n\nThe largest backbone of Amazon’s success has been the expansion of technological capabilities with the addition of artificial intelligence. Recently, AMZN has continued to expand on this success by investing $25 million into AI research and development for the long term. Expect Amazon to utilize AI to improve AWS cloud services, website user integration and their other products. Leading to AMZN riding the AI tailwind into a more significant position among blue-chip stocks.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) showed significant financial growth over the past year, reflected by its market cap, which grew from $399.59 billion in 2023 to $481.57 billion in 2024. XOM also saw a levered FCF margin of 7.01%. These metrics depict Exxon as a profitable company with a massive growth prospect, making it viable for all investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global oil and gas market is valued at $7625.82 billion as of 2024 and is projected to reach $9347.90 billion by 2028. Critical factors for this growth include urbanization, modernization, and the rising concern regarding electric vehicles and their longevity.\n\nXOM’s stock is solely dependent on the price of crude oil, and over the past year the price rose from a national average of $3.44 per gallon to $3.53 per gallon. This price spike is partially the result of the Russian-Ukrainian war, two nations that are major exporters of natural gas. Similar to this conflict, there are reports of a potential conflict between Israel and Iran occurring soon. If that happens, we could see most of the Middle East become engulfed in war. This would see oil prices spike again, raising XOM’s stock significantly. Due to the current state of geopolitics in the Middle East and proven financials, I expect XOM to be among the blue-chip stocks that see price increases extremely soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Blake Brittain\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services, the world's largest cloud-service provider, owes tech company Kove $525 million for violating its patent rights in data-storage technology, an Illinois federal jury said on Wednesday.\n\nThe jury determined that AWS infringed three Kove patents covering technology that Kove said had become \"essential\" to the ability of Amazon's cloud-computing arm to \"store and retrieve massive amounts of data.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. Kove's lead attorney Courtland Reichman called the verdict \"a testament to the power of innovation and the importance of protecting IP rights for start-up companies against tech giants.\"\n\nChicago-based Kove sued Amazon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in 2018. The company said in the lawsuit that it pioneered technology enabling high-performance cloud storage \"years before the advent of the cloud.\"\n\nKove alleged that AWS' Amazon S3 storage service, DynamoDB database service and other products infringed the cloud-storage patents. The jury agreed with Kove on Wednesday that AWS infringed all three Kove patents at issue, though it rejected Kove's contention that AWS violated its rights willfully.\n\nAWS had denied the allegations and argued that the patents were invalid.\n\nKove also sued Google last year for infringing the same patents in a separate Illinois lawsuit that is still ongoing.\n\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "It’s been both fascinating and alarming to watch the generative AI explosion unfold. A new, interesting technology has captured the public’s imagination thanks to its ability to generate everything from text to video. But there are fears those same capabilities make it a potential threat to a host of jobs ranging from programmers and artists to human resources workers and financial professionals.\n\nThere’s little doubt generative AI will impact some jobs. According to Intel, we could eventually see the rise of AI technologies so powerful they’ll replace entire corporate departments. But the generative AI job-pocalypse won’t destroy every job it touches. As with all things, it’s a bit more complicated than that. And the truth is, there’s still a lot we don’t know.\n\n“It is going to be a major disruption that unfolds over many years, at least 10 years,” Columbia Business School professor Daniel Keum told Yahoo Finance. “And it'll create losers and winners. But what that exactly looks like, we don't know.”\n\nAccording to experts, generative AI will make some jobs easier, while creating others. The thinking is similar to how the internet and e-commerce displaced some positions while helping to bring about entirely new categories of jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella are championing AI in the workplace. (AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“It might be an existential threat to a very narrow set of jobs just like any technology,” explained professor Sonny Tambe, co-director of The Wharton School’s AI at Wharton program.And we’ve seen these kinds of changes before.\n\n“Even something much more general purpose like, say, a tractor, has a large impact on a narrow set of jobs,” Tambe said. “For most of us, I think it is actually a really useful tool, but not an existential threat, necessarily.”\n\nWe still don’t know what jobs are most at risk\n\nAccording to a July Pew Research Center report, 19% of jobs will have some kind of exposure to generative AI. That means AI will augment some parts of those positions, though not necessarily replace them.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperts I spoke with said customer service workers, tax preparers, and others could face pressure as companies begin using generative AI-powered chatbots to answer customer queries or instantly fill documents. However, if you’ve used a chatbot to try to get a comprehensive answer to questions about anything from your health insurance to how to return a shirt, you know they can be frustratingly ineffective.\n\nHarvard Business School professor Andy Wu says generative AI could lead to the creation of programs that respond to voice directions. According to Wu, users could someday control complex apps like Adobe’s (ADBE) Photoshop using natural language instructions, meaning rather than clicking through menus to edit photos, they’ll simply be able to tell apps how they want an image to look.\n\nThat could help photo editors by making their jobs easier or give middle managers an easy reason to replace them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays shows off the company's latest AI chips at Nvidia GDC 2024. (Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, many of these tools are still flawed as well. Generative AI images feature glaring errors like people with oddly placed hands or Google’s multicultural Nazis. Generative AI chatbots are also prone to hallucinations, a fancy term for errors that seem authoritative. Even AI transcription apps often pick up the wrong words.\n\nNew jobs will emerge\n\nJust as AI is all but certain to impact some jobs, it will also help create new opportunities. Take the Photoshop app example. By making apps and services more easy to access, more people can begin using them, bringing more creativity into various fields.\n\nWith the advent of blogs and social networks, more people than ever can share their thoughts with the world, something you previously needed a media organization to do.\n\nAnd with the development of large graphics engines from the likes of Unity and Epic, individual programmers can develop their own games rather than relying on an entire fleet of developers. That doesn’t mean programmers for big-name games have gone away, but rather that gamers can now get access to both highly polished major game releases and independent games.\n\nIt will take time before we feel the full impact of AI\n\nWhether good or bad, it’ll likely be some time before we feel the full force of generative AI’s impact on the job market. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“If you look at the data, less than 10% of US firms report that they've adopted [generative AI] in some fashion, and probably still in an experimental phase,” Pew Research Center senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar told Yahoo Finance. “So we don't know. It’s too early to say which way things are going.”\n\nOf course, if you listen to Big Tech companies ranging from Nvidia and Microsoft to Google and Intel, we’ll start feeling generative AI’s changes any day now. But the reality is that it will still take years, if not more, to sort out the technology’s impact on the job market.\n\nRemember how self-driving trucks were supposed to steal truckers’ jobs? That’s still far from reality. And early predictions that self-driving cars would be ferrying us around by now? Those have fallen decidedly flat.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Wall Street continues assigning buy ratings for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The sector’s rally remains solid as corporations post record revenue and earnings. Some AI stocks have overstretched themselves and need perfection to justify their valuations. However, a few AI stocks can still deliver long-term gains.\n\nAlthough investors can analyze stocks, it’s a good idea to evaluate Wall Street’s outlook. Stock analysts dig deep into investment theses for a living and present their research to consumers and clients. So, let’s delve into the top AI stocks that are captivating Wall Street.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been late to the AI party. Other tech giants have been pushing ahead, but Alphabet has been gaining traction. Alphabet is working on a custom AI chip that will make AI more affordable and accessible for its customers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, Google Cloud is a growing revenue segment that makes up roughly 11% of the company’s total revenue. It’s helped the company increase its revenue by 13% year-over-year (YOY) in Q4 2023.\n\nThe stock is rated as a strong buy among 37 analysts with an average price target that suggests a 6% upside. The highest price target of $185 per share indicates that the stock can rally by an additional 18%.\n\nFinally,Alphabet shares are up by 13% year-to-date (YTD), gaining 159% over the past five years. The company has done a great job of increasing its profit margins. The stock trades at a 29 P/E ratio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The company trumps competitors as it continues delivering impressive financial growth.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) grew by 13% YOY in the fourth quarter of 2023 to reach $24.2 billion in total sales. And, Amazon as a whole generated $170.0 billion in the quarter which was up by 14% YOY. Also, the tech conglomerate works exceptional well at raising its net profit margins.\n\nTherefore, investors are excited about the company’s initiatives. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The highest price target of $230 per share indicates that shares can gain an additional 24% from current levels. AMZN is a strong buy based on the ratings from 41 analysts, while the stock is up by 81% over the past year.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is gaining market share in the cybersecurity industry and delivering exceptional long-term gains for shareholders. The stock has increased 141% over the past year and is up by 382% over the past five years.\n\nFurthermore, CRWD generated more than $3 billion in annual recurring revenue and reported a 33% YOY revenue increase in Q4 FY24. Its Falcon Platform is one of the most reliable resources for businesses that want to detect and address threats before becoming widespread problems.\n\nSince AI is an innovative technology, it creates new vulnerabilities. For instance, cybercriminals are using deepfake technology to impersonate executives. So, while generative AI has great potential, the technology has also fallen prey to bad characters.\n\nIncreasingly, Modern cybersecurity is becoming a battle of AI tools. And Crowdstrike has been investing in AI to keep its customers protected. Those investments can help it gain additional market share in the industry.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and AMZN.

        "title": "China flooding Britain with fake stamps in act of ‘economic warfare’",
        "content": "China Fake Stamps\n\nChina is behind the scourge of counterfeit stamps flooding Britain and landing victims with £5 penalties, The Telegraph understands.\n\nSources close to Royal Mail said that forgeries from the Communist country were behind a rise in complaints that letters sent with stamps bought from legitimate stores were being flagged as fraudulent.\n\nSecurity experts and MPs described the mass forgery as an “act of economic warfare” and akin to “printing counterfeit money”.\n\nIt is understood that the convincing forgeries are being bought unwittingly by small retailers, who are not required to buy stamps directly from Royal Mail and can instead source them from wholesalers in bulk.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt comes after the Royal Mail last week launched a review into its new barcoded stamps amid fears customers are wrongly being forced to pay £5 to collect letters.\n\nPost Office minister Kevin Hollinrake said he expects Royal Mail to investigate how the counterfeit stamps from China entered the supply chain and were being sold in shops.\n\nRoyal Mail insists its systems are not faulty – meaning any stamps flagged as counterfeit are likely to be fakes from China.\n\nA Telegraph investigation identified four major Chinese suppliers offering to print up to one million counterfeit Royal Mail stamps a week for as little as 4p each – and deliver them to Britain within days.\n\nThe stamps are also being sold through online retail giants such as Amazon and eBay – and on websites that mimic the official Royal Mail store.\n\nA senior figure at Royal Mail admitted to BBC One’s Watchdog that he could not spot the difference between a counterfeit and a genuine stamp.\n\nDavid Gold, director of external affairs and policy, said: “The reality is counterfeiters are now so good at what they do that even I, and I work for Royal Mail, I can’t tell the difference just by looking at them.”\n\nSecurity experts have warned that the mass fraud is “economic warfare” done with the “tacit approval” of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe postal workers union CWU has also said that the “scam on an unprecedented scale” had resulted in a rise in aggression against its members and risked further damage to the Post Office brand following the Horizon computer scandal.\n\nThe Royal Mail introduced barcode stamps in 2022 in an effort to put a stop to forgeries that were costing the postal service tens of millions of pounds every year.\n\nThe barcodes are scanned when post arrives at sorting offices and suspicious stamps are then inspected by staff who then declare if the stamp is genuine or fake. Stamp fraud has since fallen 90pc.\n\nRoyal Mail insists genuine stamps will never be marked as counterfeit, unlike those printed in China.\n\nThe Government last month revealed that China was behind a cyber attack on the Electoral Commission that compromised the data of 40 million voters, and concern in Whitehall that China was behind social media attacks on the Princess of Wales.\n\nOfficial Royal Mail stamps have been printed by the same family business in Wolverhampton for the past decade. However, more than 8,000 miles away, one factory in China’s third largest city, Shenzhen, claims it employs 39 members of staff and can produce up to one million per week.\n\nAnother company in the port city of Quanzhou, in south east China, is selling sheets of 50 first class large barcoded stamps. The listing describes the fake stamps as “mint, new and read [sic] for posting”.\n\nThe biggest supplier identified is based in Shanghai. It has numerous listings for different types of barcoded stamps including stamps featuring King Charles first released last March and older iterations which feature the late Queen.\n\nThe minimum purchase order is 20,000 stamps which are sold at $0.20 (£0.15) per stamp. However, for orders above 300,000, each stamp costs just $0.05 (£0.04) – representing a 3,275pc markup if it was sold at the Royal Mail retail price of £1.35.\n\nThe price of a first class stamp in Britain has doubled since March 2019 when it was just 67p. Since then, there have been seven price rises, culminating in last week’s rise to £1.35 for a first class stamp and 85p for a second class stamp.\n\nRoyal Mail said it believes sheets of genuine stamps, which can only be bought and sold in Britain, are being sent to China where they are then copied repeatedly to produce counterfeits in vast quantities. The forgeries are then sent to Britain where they are sold to unsuspecting retailers and consumers.\n\nAlan Mendoza, founder of national security think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said the mass production of forged stamps damaged the British economy by “robbing businesses of revenue”.\n\nHe said: “It is inconceivable that a large-scale counterfeit operation like this could be occurring without the knowledge and therefore tacit approval of the Chinese Communist Party given its strict control over the Chinese economy. As such, it’s an obvious form of economic warfare and should be called out for what it is with economic repercussions for China if it does not rein it in.”\n\nSouth Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay accidentally bought counterfeit stamps on Amazon last year.  The Conservative MP raised in Parliament last May, accusing Amazon of “facilitating the sale of counterfeit postage stamps from China” that were “virtually perfect except for the barcode”.\n\nHe said he had raised the “serious matter” with the National Crime Agency and Trading Standards but “received woeful responses”.\n\nRoyal Mail says it has taken down more than 300 suspicious listings in the past year including on Amazon and eBay.\n\nAmazon says it continues to collaborate with Royal Mail to “improve proactive detection mechanisms” as well as UK law enforcement to protect customers from “those attempting to abuse our store”.\n\nYet The Telegraph found numerous suspicious listings on Amazon – all of which had reviews claiming the stamps were fraudulent and left recipients with £5 fines.\n\nThere are also counterfeit stamp listings on eBay with one detailing in the product description that it was manufactured in China.\n\nAn eBay spokesman said: “The sale of counterfeit items is strictly prohibited on eBay and we proactively block millions of counterfeit items every year.”\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, called for a criminal investigation and said forging stamps needed to be treated with the same severity as counterfeiting money.\n\nHe said: “Criminal law is very clear about this and I don’t understand why the police are not cracking down. The law is there to be used and these people are counterfeiters and they are as bad as counterfeiting money so treat them in the same way.”\n\nHe urged the Government to take a firmer stand against China, adding: “We have to ensure we deal with this in a way that tells the Chinese ‘enough is enough’ and we should be saying to the Chinese embassy, ‘why aren’t you cracking down on this?’. Because the more this goes on, the more it undermines the very nature of law and order in the UK.”\n\nConservative MP Bob Seely said: “It is pretty appalling. It is incredibly brazen and it begs the question what are the Chinese authorities doing about this and why aren’t they cracking down, unless this is yet more undeclared conflict against the West.”\n\n“China allows [this criminality] because it damages our society and it damages our institutions and this is yet another example of that.”\n\nTom Keatinge, of defence and security think tank The Royal United Services Institute, said while he believed it was more likely a Chinese organised crime group has “identified a vulnerability” in our stamps, the “acid test will be how the Chinese state responds to this information being brought to their attention”.\n\nChina is also believed to be behind a rise in counterfeit stamps that have infiltrated the United States Postal Service (USPS). Last February, USPS warned the public to be “alert” to a rise in counterfeit stamps being sold online. In one case, US border protection seized $2.5m (£1.9m) worth of counterfeit stamps that had come from China.\n\nThe USPS now reserves the right to open and destroy any post that has been sent using counterfeit postage.\n\nBut the union that represents postmasters and postmen in the UK has warned Royal Mail not to go down a similar path.\n\nAndy Furey, of the Communication Workers Union, said post workers were facing a rise in aggression after the fake stamp penalty was increased from £2.50 to £5 last October.\n\nHe said: “This appears to be a scam on quite an unprecedented scale and it’s not good for postal workers who are knocking on people’s doors saying ‘we are going to surcharge you because this stamp is counterfeit’.\n\n“Royal Mail has an obligation not to penalise the customer and to stop it at source and get it sorted rather than pass the burden of the blame to the customer.\n\n“There is a sense of inertia about this from Royal Mail. I wonder if they are in denial about the scale of this [scam] and they are hoping it goes away.”\n\nThe union leader said the prevalence of fake stamps now risked further undermining trust in postmasters after some people claimed stamps bought at Post Offices had been flagged as counterfeit.\n\nHe said: “It’s important that the Post Office is a go to destination for customers to buy stamps, books and packs, we don’t like any bad or negative publicity around this where people are starting to question the brand [the Post Office] or the legitimacy of what they are spending their money on. We are deeply perturbed by this and we think Royal Mail has been too slow to react.”\n\nA Royal Mail spokesman said: “We are working hard to remove counterfeit stamps from circulation. We regularly monitor online marketplaces to detect suspicious activity, such as sales of heavily discounted stamps and work closely with retailers and law enforcement agencies to identify those who produce counterfeit stamps.\n\n“We work closely with a number of police forces across the country to apprehend offenders and search premises. In recent cases we have recovered stamps with a retail value of over £250,000.”\n\nHave you bought a counterfeit stamp from a Post Office? Email money@telegraph.co.uk",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. will no longer pay developers to create applications for Alexa, scrapping a key element of the company’s effort to build a flourishing app store for its voice-activated digital assistant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nAmazon recently told participants of the Alexa Developer Rewards Program, which cut monthly checks to builders of popular Alexa apps, that the offering would end at the end of June.\n\n“Developers like you have and will play a critical role in the success of Alexa and we appreciate your continued engagement,” said the notice, which was reviewed by Bloomberg. Amazon is also winding down a program that offered free credits for Alexa developers to power their programs with Amazon Web Services, according to a notice posted on a company website.\n\nDespite losing the direct payments, developers can still monetize their efforts with in-app purchases.\n\nAlexa, which powers Echo smart speakers and other devices, helped popularize voice assistants when it debuted almost a decade ago, letting users summon weather and news reports, play games and more.\n\nThe company has since sold millions of Alexa-powered gadgets, but the technology appears far from the cutting-edge amid an explosion in chatbots using generative artificial intelligence. Amazon is working to add more generative AI capabilities to the software.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon invited software developers to create their own applications, called Skills, and began paying those who met certain usage or other thresholds in 2017.\n\nDevelopers flocked to Alexa, but many efforts, especially from big companies or brands seeking a way to advertise, didn’t advance beyond limited experiments. Browsing for applications via voice is cumbersome, and many Alexa users rarely try to use the assistant for anything more complicated than trivia or playing music. Smartphones handle many tasks more quickly and capably.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon started reducing the pool of money available for the direct payments in 2020, a move that coincided with directives to stem Alexa’s losses and find new sources of revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. The apps created by paid developers, most of them small and independent, generally weren’t generating much money for Amazon, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss internal company details.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google, which invested heavily in its own voice-activated Assistant, removed third-party voice apps entirely in 2022, encouraging developers to add voice capabilities to Android smartphone apps instead.\n\n“These are older programs launched back in 2017 as a way to help newer developers interested in building skills accelerate their progress,” Amazon spokesperson Lauren Raemhild said in an emailed statement, adding that fewer than 1% of developers were using the soon-to-end programs. “Today, with over 160,000 skills available for customers and a well-established Alexa developer community, these programs have run their course, and we decided to sunset them.”\n\nMark Tucker, an early Alexa developer and enthusiast, called the move the end of an era. “Many developers are now going to need to make some tough decisions about maintaining existing or creating future experiences on Alexa,” he said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Gold rises to near record highs even as interest rate cut hopes fade",
        "content": "Gold prices are hovering over record high levels. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGold is shining bright among investors even as faith that central banks will make hefty cuts to interest rates this year dims.\n\nThe spot price of gold (GC=F) has risen to $2,366.30 per ounce, hovering record highs, meaning gold has now risen over 14% since the start of 2024.\n\n“Strong underlying momentum with the buy-on-dip still the prevailing strategy among traders,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\n“Geopolitical risks related to Russia/Ukraine and the Middle East are still playing a supporting role, and the focus is changing from the negative impact of lower rate cut expectations towards higher and sticky inflation,” he added.\n\nWhy are gold prices going up?\n\nGold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and as a hedge against inflation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe precious metal has had a record-breaking run since mid-February, boosted by expectations for US rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and China’s economic woes.\n\nFutures traders have reduced bets on how much the US Federal Reserve will cut rates this year to the lowest level since October.\n\nTraders now expect fewer than three quarter-point cuts to US interest rates this year, down from up to six cuts expected in January.\n\nHigh interest rates usually constrain the appeal of holding non-yielding gold, but the precious metal has been ignoring these factors so far. The market is waiting for the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting minutes and US inflation data due on Wednesday for fresh signals on future US rate path.\n\nRead more: UK interest rate cut more likely as pay growth slows\n\nSome central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves, with China’s central bank purchasing gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month in March.\n\nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco said that concerns around the US debt could be pushing some towards the precious metal.\n\n“Then there is the concern about US debt and the long-term unsustainability of the US’ fiscal situation. That seems to have caused some central banks to increase holdings at the expense of US Treasuries,” she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in a note that gold could rally to $3,000 per ounce by 2025.\n\nIf I had invested £100 in gold, how much would I have now?\n\nMarkets are volatile and therefore so are investments but given the safe-haven status of gold, the precious metal would have been a safe bet to park your money.\n\nIf you have put £100 in gold in 2023 you would now have £121. However, despite the precious metal rally, had you put those same £100 in bitcoin (BTC-USD), you would today have £396.\n\nSurprisingly, this one commodity performed also as good as the cryptocurrency. Cocoa (CC=F) is up by around 270%, which would have secured you £373.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) shares, two of the Magnificent Seven, would have also outperformed gold. However, their track record shows far more volatility that most investors might be comfortable with, as is the case with Bitcoin.\n\nHow do I invest in gold?\n\nGold falls under the category of alternative investments, named like that as they are usually defined as alternatives to traditional investment assets, such as bonds and equities. They can be anything from art to property, hedge fund investments, gold and gold funds, and digital assets.\n\nFor those wanting to protect their investment portfolio from market uncertainty, it is worth considering gold.\n\nAnyone can invest in physical gold in the form of bars and gold coins. The Royal Mint has recorded a 7% increase in investors purchasing gold bullion last year.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks push higher ahead of key US inflation report\n\nHowever, it might be easier and cheaper to invest in gold through Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or Exchange-traded commodity (ETC) products.\n\nAnother way to go about it is to invest in shares of gold mining companies, which should get you dividends as you are investing in a business and not purely on the precious metal.\n\nLet's take a look at these three ways to invest in gold.\n\nShould you buy gold coins or bullions? A Gold Britannia 2023 coin is shown. (dpa, dpa picture alliance)\n\nIt is probably the first image on our mind when we thing about the precious metal: a gold bar or coins. If you go down this route you are investing in the physical metal.\n\nGold coins are a popular choice but mostly for collectors as you will pay a premium for the design that you might not get back. However, some coins become more desirable for collectors over time so the gambit could pay off.\n\nIf you're not bothered by the aesthetic value of gold, the straight way to go about it is to get a cast bar. A 500g will set you back £30,565 if you purchase it from the Royal Mint.\n\nRead more: King Charles gold bullion coin unveiled by Royal Mint\n\nHowever, you can start smaller, with a 2.5g bar coming in at around £170. Regardless of what you get, make you the purity is above 99.9% for coins and 99.95% for bars, so that it is VAT free.\n\nGold and other precious metals are often weighed in troy ounces. At 31.1034768 grams, one troy ounce is about 10% heavier than a regular ounce.\n\nHow to invest in gold via ETFs or ETCs The world's largest gold bullion coin is displayed to mark the official launch of the Perth Mint Physical Gold Exchange Traded Fund, outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIf you look at gold purely as an investment and do not want to handle things like storage or purity levels you can pick to invest in an ETF or ETC.\n\nThese investment products are funds that consist of only one asset: gold. They trade just like a normal stock but gets its value from holding 'underlying assets' that are centred on the precious metal, like the physical metal, gold futures or exposure to companies that mine the metal.\n\nThe main costs of investing in gold ETFs will be the ongoing charge and any platform fees. You should also pay attention to where the product trades.\n\nMost physical gold is priced in US dollars, so if an ETF or ETC operates in sterling then the USD/GBP (GBP=X)rate will likely play a role a significant role in its performance.\n\nLooking at gold ETFs traded in the USA, the DB Gold Double Long Exchange Traded Notes (DGP) has returned 26% so far this year.\n\nRead more: How to supercharge your pension this year\n\nProShares Ultra (UGL) has delivered 24.99% and Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund (DBP) has recorded a 14.09% gain since January, according to data from VettaFi.\n\nIf you want to keep things in pounds, you some top gold ETFs in the UK include the Invesco Physical Gold ETC (SGLPL.XC), that comes with a 0.12% fee, and aims to replicate the spot price movement of gold bullion as closely as possible.\n\nThere is also the iShares Physical Gold ETC (SGLNL.XC), for the same fee. This product has the particularly of only accepting gold bullion that meets the Good Delivery standards set by the London Bullion Market Association. All assets are classified as responsibly sourced, only allocating gold that was mined after 2022.\n\nBest gold stocks and how to invest in mining companies A worker prepares molten gold before it is poured into bars. (LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA via Getty Images)\n\nGold-oriented stocks and shares provide exposure to the commodity without the cost of buying and storing it.\n\nYou are investing in a company, just like you would do with any other listed business, but in this case you secure the exposure to gold but could potentially attain higher returns as gold companies can expand production and reduce costs, which can drive profits. As you own shares in the company, you could also be in line for dividends.\n\nIn the US, Galiano Gold (GAU) would have been your best bet. Shares in the company have gained 188%, considerably more than our number two.\n\nSecond place goes to Equinox Gold (EQX), with shares almost doubling. ElDorado Gold (EGO)shares come in at number three, with an 85% increase, according to data from investment platform AJ Bell.\n\nAgain, if you prefer to keep your investments UK-bound, investing in Empire Metals (EEE.L) would have secured you a 397% return in you invested at the start of last year. That means that £100 of shares are now worth close to £400. It is the best performing US-listed gold mining share since January 2023.\n\nSerabi Gold(SRB.L) has climbed over 100%, meaning you would've doubled your investment, same with Resolute Mining (RSG.L).\n\nAs always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and gold should be part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWatch: Why are gold prices suddenly hitting record highs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android",

        "title": "Plug Power Stock’s Wild Ride: Brace for Impact or Bail Out Now?",
        "content": "Plug Power stock (NASDAQ:PLUG) is in a difficult spot. The company obviously has a viable business and product. It has a list of top-name partners either using its products and services or helping it build out a vertical supply chain.\n\nOn the other hand, Plug Power stock can’t make money. It is selling its fuel cells at a significant loss resulting in negative cash flows as it burns through the cash it has on hand. It’s why it was forced to include a going concern notice last year, though it subsequently removed the wording from its annual report.\n\nInvestors have been the losers. Plug Power stock is down 30% in 2024, off 67% over the past year and the hydrogen fuel cell leader has lost over 95% of its value from the all-time high hit in 2021. During that time shareholders have suffered through significant dilution as Plug issued ever more shares. Between 2018 and 2023, PLUG stock’s share count grew from 218 million to over 595 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s past time investors looked dispassionately at their company. Plug Power is not in a good spot and despite its cheap valuation, the stock is not a buy.\n\nProfits are always just over the next hill\n\nPlug Power generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2023, a record for the company, and 27% higher than the year-ago figure. But net losses nearly doubled to $2.50 per share, though they were caused in part by investing in growth and expansion projects. CEO Andy Marsh says 2024 will be the year Plug Power gets its financial house in order.\n\n“Recognizing the past challenges with cash management, we are dedicated in 2024 to bolstering our financial profile. Our commitment to driving forward the hydrogen economy remains unwavering.”\n\nThat’s fine, but investors have heard that refrain before. Last year Marsh was confident 2023 was the year it would achieve break-even margins. He also forecast generating $2 billion in sales on its way to $20 billion in revenue(!) by 2030. Shareholders have likely learned to discount the grandiose claims management makes at this point.\n\nYet this is a real business\n\nAs noted at the start, Plug Power stock is not some vaporware business. Its fuel cells work in the warehouses of Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Walmart, in fact, accounts for over 23% of Plug’s revenue. That includes a warrant charge of $5.9 million resulting from a 2017 agreement between Plug, the retailer, and Amazon to purchase some 55.3 million shares of company stock over a period of years.\n\nThe warrants are recorded as a reduction in revenue so the contribution amount is actually higher. At the end of last year, almost 35 million of Walmart’s warrant shares had vested. All of Amazon’s 55 million warrant shares have vested. Plug’s second-largest customer accounts for almost 11% of total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it’s not as though Plug’s customers aren’t invested in its success. It’s just that Plug Power can’t seem to turn into a profitable business.\n\nWait for PLUG stock to make good\n\nWhether or not Plug Power is pinky-swear level ready to make 2024 its year to turn around, investors shouldn’t hold their breath. They’ve been promised this for so long they ought to be numb to management’s entreaties at this point.\n\nAs hard as it may be to let go, 2024 should be the year shareholders sell their stock and wait for Plug Power to make good on its promises. Only then should investors be willing to put their money into play again. Until then, Plug Power stock can only be considered a sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The tech sector offers numerous opportunities to outperform the stock market.\n\nInvestors can see the gap by comparing the S&P 500 with the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. The information technology segment has outperformed the broader S&P 500 year to date (YTD), over the past year and over the past five years. Funds like IUIT give investors exposure to the S&P 500 Information Technology index.\n\nWhile the sector offers many opportunities, some tech stocks are better than others. If you are shopping around for some tech stocks, make sure you consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) microsoft stock\n\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has delivered impressive gains for long-term investors. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and is already off to a strong start with a 15% YTD again.\n\nDespite impressive gains, Microsoft should continue to rally. The Q2 FY24 earnings report came in with solid results. Revenue increased by 18% year over year (YOY) while net income jumped by 33% YOY. The company is applying artificial intelligence (AI) at scale across its product suite.\n\nAnalysts have an almost universal sense of optimism for this stock. The average price target implies an 11% upside which has prompted a strong buy rating. The highest price target of $550 per share indicates the stock can rally by an additional 29% from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft’s growing cloud division suggests that the stock can continue to rally. Cloud revenue increased by 24% YOY, making up over half of the company’s total revenue. If that growth continues, Microsoft’s profit margins should also increase.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The highest price of $230 per share indicates that shares can jump by an additional 24% from current levels.\n\nThe tech conglomerate delivered another impressive earnings report for Q4 of 2023. Revenue increased by 14% YOY, reaching a record $170 billion. The company’s online marketplace and cloud computing segments both achieved double-digit growth rates. And, Amazon expanded its profit margins to 6.25%.\n\nFurthermore, the company continues to gain market share for its two most important categories. However, it’s also making strides with advertising, video streaming and artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon’s strong leadership team can still innovate and tap into new industries. AMZN has been a top holding in many funds, delighting shareholders with an 81% gain over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Hackers are getting smarter by using more sophisticated tools to penetrate companies’ databases. But businesses are also getting wiser by working with companies like Crowdstrike to detect and eliminate threats before they get serious.\n\nAlso, CRWD has always delivered impressive revenue growth rates. The company achieved a 33% YOY revenue increase and brought its annual recurring revenue to $3.44 billion.\n\nFortunately, the firm finds itself in the right industry at the right time. Cybersecurity is expected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate of 12.3% from now until 2030. Despite the growth rate, many cybersecurity firms have been reporting lower revenue growth rates and have trimmed guidance.\n\nHowever, Crowdstrike is one of the few exceptions to the rule. The company continues to grow while elevating its net profit margins. Crowdstrike’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive GAAP net income yielded $53.7 million. The net profit margin was 6.35% for the quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT and AMZN.

        "title": "Meet the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Billionaire Investors Are Absolutely Piling Into",
        "content": "Although Wall Street offers few guarantees, short-term volatility is one of them. Since the curtain opened on 2020, Wall Street's three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years (through 2023).\n\nWhen equities are getting whipsawed by uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to seek the safety of industry-leading stocks, such as the companies that make up the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPatient investors have gravitated to the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. Listed in descending order of current market cap (as of April 5, 2024), these seven titans are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two defining traits that have made the Magnificent Seven such popular holdings for investors. To start with, they're undeniable outperformers. Over the trailing decade, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a rock-solid 182%. Comparatively, Nvidia's stock has zoomed higher by approximately 19,230%, the shares of Amazon and Tesla have gained more than 1,000%, and Alphabet is bringing up the caboose with a gain of \"only\" 464% from its Class A shares (GOOGL). MSFT Chart\n\nThe other reason investors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven is because they all offer clearly defined competitive advantages or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure service platform Azure ranks second in global market share. Meanwhile, Windows remains the clear leader in desktop operating systems. Apple's iPhone has accounted for a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable versions in 2020. Apple also has the largest share repurchase program on Wall Street. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for a 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon sits at the top of the pack in e-commerce and among cloud infrastructure service platforms. Its e-commerce marketplace oversaw nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) gobbled up a 31% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the September-ended quarter. Alphabet's Google has a virtual monopoly in global internet search, with a 91% share in March 2024. Alphabet is also the parent of the second-most-visited social network (YouTube) and the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms' social media networks attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) during the December-ended quarter. This includes Facebook, which alone lured in 3.07 billion MAUs. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's been generating a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced almost 1.85 million EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors have been selling all but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nBut in spite of the overwhelming success of the Magnificent Seven, many of Wall Street's most prominent billionaire investors began kicking these outperformers to the curb during the December-ended quarter.\n\nAll told, six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks were either jettisoned from billionaires' portfolios or meaningfully pared down, including:\n\nNvidia: Eight highly successful billionaire money managers reduced their positions in this AI titan, with Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold), Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold), and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) leading the way. Microsoft: Seven accomplished billionaires were sellers of Microsoft stock in the December-ended quarter, including Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares sold) and Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares sold), who both closed out their respective funds' positions. Alphabet: Seven top-tier billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Alphabet during the fourth quarter. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont (3,302,342 shares sold), Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel (3,113,001 shares sold), and Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman (1,278,300 shares sold) were the respective top sellers. Meta Platforms: Six tenured billionaires gave shares of Meta the boot in the quarter ended in December. The top sellers included Jeff Yass of Susquehanna (3,037,082 shares sold) and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global (1,430,767 shares sold). Apple: Four respected billionaire money managers reduced their stakes in Apple during the fourth quarter. This included Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who oversaw the sale of a little over 10 million shares of Apple. Tesla: A total of three well-known billionaire investors sold shares of EV maker Tesla in the final quarter of 2023. Billionaires John Overdeck and David Siegel, who co-founded Two Sigma Investments, saw their funds sell all 1,015,385 shares of Tesla they'd owned as of the previous quarter.\n\nThe one name missing from this list, and the only Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires are absolutely piling into, is e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the fourth quarter, eight billionaires added shares of Amazon to their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why billionaire investors can't stop buying Amazon stock\n\nIf you're wondering why billionaires are buying shares of Amazon stock while paring down or exiting their stakes in the other Magnificent Seven stocks, look no further than Amazon's trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments: AWS, advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates very low margins. The bulk of the cash flow and operating income Amazon produces come from its trio of ancillary segments.\n\nNone of these segments is more important than AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit sales growth should be the expectation for AWS. Even though this segment only accounted for a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it provided about two-thirds of its operating income.\n\nAmazon's advertising operations are another source of sustained growth. In a typical month, Amazon's website is the destination for well over 2 billion visitors, many of whom are motivated shoppers. This makes Amazon one of the primary platforms that merchants want to target when getting their message(s) in front of consumers.\n\nThe third key operating division is subscription services. The last time Amazon updated its global Prime subscription count was April 2021, when then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company had surpassed 200 million. With Amazon gaining the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, there's a high likelihood this subscription total has jumped further.\n\nCollectively, the lure of these higher-growth segments is their cash flow generation. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock. Patient investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for just 13 times consensus cash flow in 2025. Even approaching its previous all-time high, Amazon stock is historically inexpensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "If you ever find yourself struggling to find a great idea for a stock to add to your portfolio, here's a simple solution -- borrow an idea from a proven stock picker.\n\nWarren Buffett is one such stock picker who might be just what you need. After all, his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio regularly outperforms the S&P 500 index. He's clearly doing something right.\n\nHere's a rundown of three Buffett picks currently held by Berkshire that would be at home in most anyone else's portfolio. In no particular order...\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nIs Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) predictable to the point of being boring? Probably. But that doesn't make it a bad pick. This predictability makes it a great stock pick, in fact, specifically because it supports the top bullish argument for owning a stake in the drinks giant.\n\nYou know the company. This organization is of course parent to its namesake (and highly popular) cola, as well as other beverage brands ranging from Gold Peak tea to Sprite to Powerade to Minute Maid juices, just to name a few. It's a great business to be in even if it's not a high-growth market. These are products consumers purchase in any and all economic environments; loyalty to these well-developed brand names is strong, too.\n\nCoca-Cola's actual business, however, may not be quite what you think it is.\n\nSee, the organization does very little of its own bottling these days. Rather, its core business model is selling concentrated flavor syrups to localized bottlers and then marketing the daylights out of the products that someone else ultimately manufactures. This defers much of the work and cost-based risk of the business to these bottlers, who pay Coca-Cola royalties for these consumer goods. This royalty-collection model is very consistent and predictable. It's so consistent, in fact, that Coca-Cola's been able to raise its dividend payment every year for the past 62 years with no real fiscal strain.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway currently holds 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, which yields 3.26%.It's a position Buffett's been sitting on since late 2006.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nWarren Buffett's decision to steer Berkshire Hathaway into a position in e-commerce behemoth Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) turned more than a few heads back in 2019. Buffett's never been a big fan of technology stocks. He thinks they're too difficult to understand, leaving their shareholders at something of a disadvantage.\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha, however, can't deny it's been a fruitful holding even if it was most likely a pick from one of his acolytes. Amazon shares are up 70% since Berkshire bought them four years ago.\n\nHis willingness to jump into and stick with the unlikely pick is rooted in the same reasons most other shareholders own a piece of the e-commerce powerhouse. That is, it's outgrowing its rivals in a market that it dominates. Its fiscal fourth-quarter top line improved 14% year over year, capping off 12% growth for the full year and overcoming economic malaise in the process. Sales growth should top 11% this year as well as next year, pumping up the bottom line even more.\n\nThe thing is, Amazon actually does check off several of the criteria Buffett uses when choosing a stock. Chief among these rules is that \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" Amazon stock has never been cheap by marketwide standards. But there's no arguing it hasn't been a wonderful company since shortly after its inception. The stock's never really been held back by its historically rich valuation.\n\n3. Chevron\n\nLast but not least, add oil and gas name Chevron(NYSE: CVX) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now. Shares are still down 13% from their all-time high hit in 2022, pushing the dividend yield up to 4%.\n\nIt's not that Berkshire Hathaway hasn't bought and held energy stocks before. But as time has marched on and renewable energy sources have finally started threatening to displace fossil fuels, Buffett's interest in these tickers has seemingly waned. That's why the fund's foray back into the business with its 2020 re-entry into Chevron was eye-opening. Since then it's grown into Berkshire's fifth-biggest position, making the stake even more curious. What does Buffett see here?\n\nThe dividend helps, to be sure. As it turns out, however, the world's not nearly as ready to make the shift to carbon-free energy as was hoped would be the case by this point. Given the ever-growing need for energy (linked to the planet's ever-growing population), the United States Energy Information Administration predicts that petroleum and related liquids will still be the planet's top source of energy production as far down the road as 2050. And that's not counting natural gas, which should be the world's third-biggest energy source by then, right behind renewables.\n\nThe bigger takeaway here, however, is that the world will still likely be burning more oil then than it's burning now.\n\nIt's a scenario that clearly bodes well for Chevron even if crude oil is politically, socially, and culturally unpopular at this time. Just keep in mind that -- like Coca-Cola -- Chevron is more of an income holding than a growth holding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

That's impressive for companies already worth trillions of dollars in some cases!\n\nBut 2024 has represented a changing of the guard of sorts. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have hit some headwinds. The remaining group of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) continue to rally, resembling a new group, a \"Fab Four\" that continues to carry the market to all-time highs.\n\nCan they continue to separate themselves from the pack?\n\nForget the Magnificent Seven and embrace the Fab Four. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA changing of the guard in 2024\n\nApple, Tesla, and Alphabet haven't kept up the pace since 2024 began. Alphabet's year-to-date gains have \"only\" tracked the S&P 500, while Apple and Tesla have started to slide. Apple and Tesla are reporting hiccups in their growth efforts. Tesla's deliveries began 2024 with a thud, while Apple is dealing with weakness in China, a vital market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Alphabet is experiencing its first threat to its monopoly on search engine traffic from generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Analysts have dramatically soured on Tesla's near-term growth outlook, and Apple's valuation got too hot for the growth it was putting on the table.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" enjoy growth tailwinds\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven form the Fab Four, thanks primarily to expected tailwinds from artificial intelligence over the coming years. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, which are needed to power the massive computer systems that run AI. Amazon and Microsoft operate the world's two largest cloud platforms, the underpinnings of the internet, and what will be various AI applications. Lastly, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI for digital advertising while investing heavily in augmented reality.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth these opportunities will create, calling for annualized long-term earnings growth ranging from 15% to 35% over the next three to five years.\n\nValuations say the momentum can continue\n\nHow much you pay for a stock always matters. It's not that Tesla, Alphabet, and Apple can't succeed in the future, but their valuations have become too disconnected from what the market expects growth to look like.\n\nInvestors can use the PEG ratio to compare a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth to determine whether shares are still a good value. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf you use the data from the above charts, the Fab Four have the following PEG ratios:\n\nNvidia: 1 Amazon: 1.9 Microsoft: 2.4 Meta: 1.3\n\nThe lower the PEG ratio is, the better the value. I generally look to buy when PEG ratios are under 1.5, so Nvidia and Meta remain excellent deals if they can deliver the growth analysts expect from them. Amazon is a bit more expensive but is a more capital-intensive company. If you price the stock to its operating cash flow, its valuation is still below its decade average. Admittedly, Microsoft is beginning to look expensive, so investors may want to think twice before buying shares.\n\nAll the companies in the Magnificent Seven are among the best in their respective industries and could easily be long-term winners. But the cream eventually rises to the top, which could be Nvidia and Meta Platforms based on the numbers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Teens are crazy about cosmetics.\n\nScroll through TikTok, and you'll find Gen Zs (and Gen Alphas) sharing skincare routines, makeup tutorials, go-to fragrances, and hairdo how-tos.\n\nIn a new survey from Piper Sandler, Taking Stock With Teens, teens' overall \"self-reported\" spending was down 6% year over year to $2,263 — but they didn't hold back on beauty products.\n\nAnnual spending on beauty is up 8% to $339, the highest level since 2018, with make up holding the highest share, but fragrance seeing the most growth.\n\nThe young fashionistas are giving some beauty companies a boost. Sephora (MC.PA) and Ulta (ULTA) are the top beauty retailers for teens, at 37% and 31%, respectively. Target (TGT) clocks in at No. 3, with 10% listing it as their favorite.\n\nOther retailers that teens favor for cosmetics include Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), SHEIN, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), and CVS (CVS).\n\nAfter Ulta reported its Q4 earnings in March, CEO David Kimbell said on an analyst call that young shoppers are interested in a spectrum of beauty products.\n\n\"Young consumers are engaged in mass [beauty], but they're also engaged in prestige [brands],\" he said. \"It's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily, as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media.\"\n\nThe increased sales from teens come as consumers pull back on overall beauty spending. Kimbell said at a conference last week that Ulta is seeing a slowdown across \"price points and segments.\"\n\nOverall, growth for US mass beauty brands is slowing, with sales increasing 3-4% year over year in Q1, compared to the 7% jump in Q4.\n\nUlta expects net sales of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion for 2024, up 4% to 5% from fiscal 2023, with an operating margin of 14.0% to 14.3%, down from 15% last year.\n\nIts stock has dropped 17% in the past month, after the soft outlook and comments about the slowdown.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Competitive intensity is definitely high, largely from Kohl's Sephora shop growth, and ULTA’s 2024 guidance implicitly bakes in some level of market share inflection, adding an element of risk,\" added Evercore ISI analyst Michael Binetti wrote in a note to clients.

(Photo by Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images for Huda Beauty) (Cedric Ribeiro via Getty Images)\n\nWhen it comes to products, E.l.f. Beauty is the teen favorite with 38% of the votes, up 16 points compared to last spring.\n\nPer J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira, the 20-year brand is only getting started. \"There is plenty of runaway as [a] disruptor of a large category, with nimble and fast execution,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIts secret? The company has capitalized on social media, first as an early adopter of Facebook, then TikTok, with significant presence on Instagram, Twitch and Roblox. Its digital sales made up 24% of revenue last quarter.\n\nYet, e.l.f. Beauty shares are also under pressure, down 12% in the past month. Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans said now is the time to buy, alluding the recent stock pullback was \"driven by ULTA's commentary around a category slowdown,\" adding that \"demand remains robust\" for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nSelena Gomez's Rare Beauty is a distant second, with 9% of teens pegging it as their favorite. Others in the top 10 include Maybelline, Charlotte Rilbury, and Rihanna's Fenty.\n\nFragrance makers are in luck. Nearly three-quarters of female teens said they use a perfume every day, up from last years' 66%.\n\nTheir favorite brand is Bath and Body Works (BBWI), with 29% of the votes, while L'Occitane Group's Sol de Janiero brand and Victoria's Secret (VSCO) took second and third, with 17% and 11%, respectively.\n\nBath and Body Works shares are up nearly 7% year-to-date, but underperform the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% gain. For fiscal 2024, the company is projecting flat to 3% decline in net sales, with a 2.5% to 4% year over year revenue drop in Q1.\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Eternal Equities: 3 Stocks to Buy and Hold Until You Retire",
        "content": "No one wants to go into retirement. However, at some point, everyone, including investors, has to think about retirement and long-term stocks. The trio of stocks we will dive into—Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG)—are all income plays with plenty of upside. These are the stocks to buy and hold are all solid picks.\n\nOur first pick is known for 15 years of consecutive dividend increases, remarkable considering what COVID-19 did to physical stores. The allure of visiting the local Home Depot and picking out your own hardware is still there. Add e-commerce growth thanks to the pandemic, and HD is looking strong.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney is in an exciting period after CEO Bob Iger came back to revamp its streaming business and focus on the parks division. A crackdown on password sharing, AI-powered robots in Disney theme parks, and ESPN’s digital evolution illustrate his vision.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, WTRG stands out among utilities, with its “boring” yet incredibly stable operating model and an industry-beating yield of 3.4%.\n\nHome Depot (HD) earnings reports hd\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) will make it on most lists of long-term stocks thanks to an industry-beating yield of 2.5%. Add to that 15 years of consecutive dividend increases, and you can understand why investors value HD stock highly.\n\nHowever, to make a name for itself among long-term stocks, a company needs to demonstrate resilience above all else. Home Depot certainly has demonstrated resilience, having withstood the pandemic, particularly brutal on home improvement.\n\nI believe HD is able to do this because of two critical factors: its e-commerce sales and business model. In 2019, around the start of the pandemic, e-commerce sales clocked in at just under 10%, but the figure rose to 14.2% by 2022. The business does not revolve around e-commerce; the bulk still serves professional contractors and subcontractors.\n\nHowever, each quarter, revenue moves online by a certain percentage point, and that’s good news if Home Depot wants to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Despite a revenue drop in the latest quarter, digital sales increased 2%.\n\nIn addition, due to the nature of house repair and restoration, which frequently necessitates in-person consultations and purchases, visiting your local Home Depot is an essential physical experience that will not face too much digital disruption. That gives Home Depot a double advantage. You can see why this made our list of stocks to buy and hold.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney (DIS) an image of mickey mouse on a yellow background to represent disney (DIS)\n\nSource: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is slightly different from Home Depot because it does not quite have a similar industry-beating yield. However, when you mix in some very healthy capital appreciation, the stock is up over 29% this year, and you begin to see the logic of picking this one from a sea of long-term stocks.\n\nWhen discussing Disney, it’s important to understand that when you purchase this stock, changing hands for around $117, you are actually getting a basket of businesses, including television networks, major studios, and theme parks. The great thing about buying into a company like Disney, therefore, is diversification. If one part of the business is not doing well, another unit can compensate.\n\nWe all saw that during the pandemic, the theme park business suffered an immense blow after shutdowns. However, Disney did not blink an eye and promptly shifted its focus to streaming. Now, the pandemic is over, and last year, DIS made $32.6 billion from its parks and experiences, up 16% from the previous year. Moreover, the streaming business built up during the pandemic brought in $8 billion for the media behemoth, a 13% rise.\n\nThe return of Bob Iger as CEO is also worth mentioning; his impact is beyond numbers and is more strategy-related. At the annual shareholders meeting, CEO Bob Iger delivered a message of ‘Renewed Strength,’ focusing on innovation. Disney is already materializing the vision, with innovations in how baseball programming is taking place, ESPN’s two-part streaming plan, and the use of AI in Disney parks.\n\nNot to be outshone, the experiences segment alone will get $60 billion over the next 10 years, demonstrating Disney knows where the money is.\n\nEssential Utilities (WTRG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEssentialUtilities (NYSE:WTRG) will often be overlooked because of its rather boring operating model. But boring operating models are what retirement portfolios are all about, and with an industry-beating yield of 3.4%, I don’t think many will complain about this utilities play.\n\nAfter acquiring Peoples, a natural gas distribution firm, in 2020, Essential Utilities—previously known as Aqua America—changed to WTRG. Across ten states, it serves around 5.5 million customers, making it the second-largest publicly-listed water utility in the US. Competition faces significant obstacles to entrance due to its extremely capital-intensive business model and regulatory framework, insulating WTRG.\n\nAnother element distinguishing Essential Utilities is its dividend history. It has paid a consecutive quarterly cash dividend for over 79 years, with more than 30 years of rate hikes, putting it in line for Dividend King status.\n\nThe timing is also great with WTRG since it’s coming off a slightly lackluster earnings report, missing earnings by 1.5%. Nevertheless, record infrastructure investments totaling $1.19 billion set it up well for the future.\n\nAdditionally, WTRG added more than 11,000 subscribers in 2023 by acquiring seven systems. It is in the process of signing deals to purchase more systems, which should service around 215,000 users and cost about $380 million. It’s actively looking to acquire businesses that account for more than 400,000 clients overall.\n\nWTRG has set a range of $1.96 to $2.00 for the 2024 EPS projection. Through 2028, it expects the regulated water segment and natural gas segment to grow at around 8% and 10%, respectively. These stocks to buy and hold are essential to a healthy portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Cloud Computing Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks took a backseat to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks last year. Hence, the market is now overlooking the indispensable role of cloud computing in pushing the envelope for AI’s evolution. Moreover, with the massive role of cloud computing stocks in sustaining current and future technological advancements, it remains one of the most stable tech investments.\n\nCloud computing businesses provide the essential infrastructure to power the AI revolution. Moreover, its capabilities enable them to drive innovation and deployment across multiple sectors while laying the foundation of other emerging technologies, including blockchain, IoT, and the metaverse, among others. With that said, you’d be remiss if you ignored the top cloud computing stocks discussed in the article.\n\nCloud Computing Stocks: Amazon (AMZN) Logistics activity on the Amazon (AMZN) site of Vélizy-Villacoublay in France. Packages are sorted by workers on conveyors.\n\nSource: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed king in the cloud computing realm, boasting a 31% global market share. Moreover, despite concerns about its market leadership and the fierce competition in the cloud computing niche, it remains well-equipped for whatever the future holds. It maintained its dominance in the final quarter of last year again, reporting $24.20 billion in sales, in line with analyst estimates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs we advance, its cloud computing arm in Amazon Web Services (AWS) could potentially drive tremendous long-term growth, piggybacking on the fast-evolving AI trend. AWS’s collaboration with the biggest tech providers and vast infrastructure positions it enviably among the ‘cloud czars.’\n\nFurthermore, a recent survey by Mizuho Securities highlighted AWS’s incredible potential for growth in 2024 on the back of its powerful AI capabilities and Bedrock offering. The survey covering 300 Fortune 1000 companies showed greater levels of executive engagement along with expedited deal closures within 60 days, a healthy improvement over the usual 90-day sales cycle.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has gained plenty of traction due to its AI endeavors, but the robust performance of its cloud segment is currently driving its impressive growth. It has blown past top-line estimates by an average of $1.34 billion in the past four quarters, and much of it is due to the rapid expansion in its Intelligent Cloud division.\n\nThe division has grown at a monstrous pace over the past several years, delivering $22.1 billion in sales last year, compared to the $7.9 billion it made in 2018. Moreover, it kept up the momentum in the first quarter (Q1), where the Intelligent Cloud segment reported a stellar 20% jump in quarterly sales, reaching $25.88 billion. Notably, Azure and other cloud services saw a 30% revenue growth, beating analyst expectations of 27%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the tech giant’s AI customer base stands at a healthy 53,000, roughly 33% of those being new additions in 2023. As we advance, the synergy between AI and cloud computing is set to play a massive role in taking Microsoft’s growth trajectory to a whole new level.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a bona fide juggernaut in the world of customer relationship management (CRM). Its cloud-based platform has become ubiquitous, serving multiple organizational functions for its continuously expanding customer base. Moreover, it’s been one of the most consistent businesses in its niche, having beaten analyst estimates across both lines since Q1 2020. Such is the mission-critical nature of its services, and the fusion of AI could take things up a few notches.\n\nThe firm’s AI Cloud strategy significantly enhances productivity across sales, service, marketing, and other areas through predictive analytics and personalized customer experience. It plans to leverage its cutting-edge AI technology in Einstein AI across its software suite to take things to the next level. For instance, by layering AI in its powerful communication tool in Slack, the company is set to significantly boost workplace productivity through automation, AI-generated content summaries, and AI-driven applications.\n\nThose are only some of the ways Salesforce can take advantage of AI’s burgeoning potential. Additionally, it has allocated a hefty $250 million to its Generative AI Fund, and I expect it to continue spending millions to support its AI-powered goals in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Mega-Cap Stocks Poised to Double Your Money in 3 Years",
        "content": "Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they’ve been responsible for the lion’s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So,  a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies.\n\nThe other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability.\n\nThose are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let’s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it’s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.\n\nThe logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD’s price, which was roughly $130 at that time.\n\nThat would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let’s start by running through that quickly.\n\nAnalysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let’s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026  and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML’s products and their relation to current trends. It’s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.\n\nASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it’s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,  is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here.\n\nNow is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That’s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected.\n\nThe result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I’d argue that it’s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That’s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There’s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  stock at the moment. there’s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it’s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.\n\nDon’t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk’s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting.\n\nBeyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won’t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future.\n\nHowever, it isn’t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its strong growth, it’s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here.\n\nLet’s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.\n\nNvidia’s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious.\n\nMore likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nCould Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?  The answer is a resounding: “Yes!”\n\nToyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company’s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It’s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data.\n\nThat got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn’t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.\n\nAs the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company’s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That’s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering.\n\nIn any case, it’s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let’s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba’s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43.\n\nIt doesn’t seem likely that it’ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba’s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it’s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Intel's latest AI chip is a direct shot at Nvidia's moneymaker",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) on Tuesday debuted a new AI chip designed to take on one of Nvidia’s (NVDA) most popular AI processors as part of its Intel Vision event.\n\nThe company's Gaudi 3 chip matches and exceeds Nvidia’s H100 AI processorwhen it comes to training and deploying generative AI models. The H100 is one of Nvidia's most popular chips, powering artificial intelligence applications for some of the world's biggest tech companies, from Microsoft to Google.\n\nAccording to Intel, the Gaudi 3 is 40% more power efficient with 50% faster inferencing than Nvidia’s H100. Training refers to the time it takes to train an AI foundation model like OpenAI’s GPT-3, while inferencing is the process of actually using the models for apps.\n\nIntel says the Gaudi 3 is up to 1.7 times faster when training common large language models than the H100. Intel even says its chip is an average of 1.3 times faster than Nvidia’s beefier Nvidia H200 when it comes to inferencing certain language models.\n\nIn addition to the Gaudi line of chips and Xeon CPUs, Intel is also marketing so-called AI PCs, computers equipped with neural processing units that can handle onboard AI tasks.\n\nThese AI maneuvers come at a critical time for Intel.\n\nThe company is working to reinvent itself as the leader in sophisticated chip technology while building out its chip manufacturing capabilities in the US and abroad. This includes a foundry business that will build Intel’s own chips as well as those for third-party customers. The company has already confirmed it will build chips for Microsoft.\n\nBut this reinvention is coming at a steep cost, with Intel announcing earlier this month a $7 billion operating loss for 2023 as part of its new financial reporting structure. Intel stock is down 25% so far this year. Rivals Nvidia and AMD (AMD), conversely, are up 15% and 74% so far this year, respectively.\n\nIntel has been teasing the Gaudi 3 chip for some time, with CEO Pat Gelsinger showing off a version of the platform during a December press event. It’s seen as Intel’s best chance yet to compete with Nvidia in the AI market, a space the graphics chip giant dominates thanks to its powerful hardware and software.\n\nStory continues Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger discusses his company's plans to capitalize on the booming demand for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence during a conference in San Jose, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024. (Michael Liedtke/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company's new chips also come just a month after Nvidia debuted its own next-generation AI platform called Blackwell. That system includes Nvidia’s B200 AI chip, which is made up of two Blackwell chips mated together to act as a single processor.\n\nIntel is putting its AI systems forward as an alternative to Nvidia’s offerings, claiming an open-source approach that will allow customers to use the services and software that they want.\n\nAnd while Nvidia is the leader in overall AI technology, Intel is betting enterprises will remain wary of sticking with a single source for high-value needs like AI hardware.\n\nFor instance, hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others already either offer their own AI chips or are developing them in addition to using Nvidia’s chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIntel’s Gaudi 3 will give those hyperscalers another option in the chip market.\n\nIntel also announced on Tuesday a new form of Ethernet connectivity for Gaudi 3 nodes, competing with Nvidia’s InfiniBand connectivity technology to ensure uninterrupted connections and processing. The company also debuted its Xeon 6 processors for use in AI systems.\n\nTaking a page out of Nvidia’s book, Intel is offering the entire setup as a reference design that partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro can use to build their own server cabinets.\n\nIntel says customers will be able to order the Gaudi 3-powered systems in sizes ranging from individual nodes and small boxes to enormous megaclusters that can fill entire data centers.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN share price reached an all-time high of $187.29 during the intraday trading on Monday, surpassing its record closing price of $186.57 in July 2021, which was marked the highest in the pandemic-led booming era for internet and e-commerce stocks. It was the first time the stock soared this high in the post-pandemic period. Moreover, the e-commerce and cloud giant’s market capitalization is moving closer to $2 trillion, which is noteworthy ahead of its first-quarter 2024 earnings.\r\n\r\nThe surge reflects investor confidence in Amazon's robust retail business, strengthening cloud division, growing investments in generative AI, solid advertising business, and expanding streaming services.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 21.8% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 9.5%, and the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry’s and Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s returns of 11.6% and 8.8%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the looming question remains — can Amazon sustain this momentum?\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nStrength in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Aid Growth\n\nThe company’s cloud computing arm, AWS, dominates the cloud market on the back of its robust portfolio. In this regard, AWS’s growing efforts to power its cloud services with generative AI remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAWS offers Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company’s recent collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA through which it will make the latter’s NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, remains a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\r\n\r\nFurther, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs. AWS also intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market. Per an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nIn addition to generative AI efforts, AWS’s expanding data center network, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones are expected to continue aiding it in offering low latency and access to its robust cloud portfolio, including AI, machine learning, data analytics and the Internet of Things to the customers seamlessly. This, in turn, will drive its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nCurrently, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions. It further plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s aggressive expansion efforts are expected to continue aiding its competitive prowess against its strong peers, such as Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google. Both companies are leaving no stone unturned to boost their presence in the promising cloud market.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure became the key driver for MSFT. Microsoft Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions across the globe, and its growing efforts to integrate generative AI into the cloud are likely to continue driving the company's cloud momentum in the near term.\r\n\r\nAzure is operating in more than 60 cloud regions at present.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Google Cloud contributes substantially to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones, increasing generative AI investments and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.\r\n\r\nLooking across the world, the total number of Google Cloud regions is currently 39, with 118 zones and 187 network edge locations.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime Momentum to Note\n\nAmazon’s solid Prime momentum, along with its strengthening distribution network, is continuously benefiting its online retail business. Prime benefits, including a strong loyalty system, customer-friendly offers, quick grocery delivery services and robust Prime Free One-Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, are driving the company’s customer momentum.\r\n\r\nApart from this, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers remains a major positive for its e-commerce business.\r\n\r\nThe company’s concerted efforts to bolster its online pharma business on the back of expanding same-day medication delivery service and strategic partnerships remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAMZN’s growing grocery retail business, on the back of solid momentum across its Fresh grocery stores and a solid network of Whole Foods Store across the United States, is a plus.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to aid Amazon in sustaining its dominance in the online retail space, as well as expanding its footprint in the offline retail market.\r\n\r\nComing to the streaming space, growing momentum in Prime Video on the back of expanding original content, regional content and the sports content portfolio, is constantly driving the Prime subscription of the company.\r\n\r\nWe note that retail perks associated with Prime, along with strength in Prime Video, are likely to continue driving growth in Amazon’s subscription revenues in the days ahead.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Around $8.20 billion, or 56.70% of the total 2023 revenue, was generated from Commerce, while the Fintech revenue was $6.27 billion, representing 43.30% of total sales.\n\nMercadoLibre's business has experienced rapid growth over the past decade. In 2013, the company had 25.30 million unique users, including 5.10 million unique sellers and 20.20 million unique buyers. In 2023, the number of unique active users surged by 8.60 times to 218 million.\n\nAlong with the growing number of unique active users, the company has managed to grow its revenue every single year, increasing from $472.60 million in 2013 to nearly $14.50 billion in 2023. On the other hand, its operating income fluctuated in the range of $144.87 million to $195 million between 2013 and 2017. In the subsequent two years, its operating income dropped to losses of $69.50 million and $153.16 million. The losses generated in 2018 and 2019 were mainly due to the increase in sales and marketing expenses relating to bad debt expenses of the credit business in Brazil, buyer protection program expenses and branding initiatives. However, MercadoLibre's operating income has bounced back strongly to reach an all-time high of $1.82 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues After Recent Decline, MercadoLibre Presents an Opportunity\n\nLooking to the future, MercadoLibre has strong growth prospects. According to Atlantico's Latin America Digital Transformation Report, the internet penetration rate in Latin America was 78% in 2023, surpassing China's rate at 74% and India's at only 49%. The penetration rates in the company's three biggest markets, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, are extremely high at 84%, 77% and 87%, respectively. Building on its leading e-commerce platform, MercadoLibre can continue to expand its fintech businesses, which include payment platform MercadoPago and the lending solution MercadoCredito, which gives loans to consumers and merchants. The growth of its fintech solutions are expected to be propelled by the fact that 70% of Latin America's population, amounting to 122 million people, remains underbanked.\n\nStrong cash flow generation\n\nMercadoLibre has been a consistent positive cash flow generator. Although its operating cash flow and free cash flow have been fluctuating widely over the past decade, they are on a rising trend. Its operating cash flow increased from $142.50 million in 2013 to $5.14 billion in 2023, while free cash flow rose from $28.30 million to $4.63 billion over the same period. In the past two years, the cash flow generation has taken off significantly, driven by the increase in profitability, payables and accrued expenses as well as a sharp rise in payables related to credit and debit card transactions. After Recent Decline, MercadoLibre Presents an Opportunity\n\nSolid balance sheet with net cash position\n\nMercadoLibre has a strong balance sheet. At the end of 2023, its total shareholders' equity was recorded at $3 billion, with cash reserves and short-term investments, including overnight bank deposits, amounting to $7.33 billion. The company's total debt, including loans payable and operating leases, stood at $5.33 billion. Consequently, MercadoLibre had a net cash position of $2 billion. Given this robust net cash position alongside an operating cash flow of $5.14 billion, it is clear MercadoLibre faces no significant challenges in meeting its debt and lease obligations.\n\nPotential upside\n\nSince 2007, the company's enterprise value-to-revenue ratio has exhibited significant volatility. After reaching a peak of 40.26 at the end of 2007, the company's revenue multiple drastically fell to 2.92 during the global recession in 2008, only to rebound shortly thereafter. In the period of 2009 to 2021, its sales valuation has oscillated within a broad range of 8 to 25.30. Currently, MercadoLibre is valued at only 5.40 times its revenue, which is nearly 50% below its 17-year average sales multiple of 11.40. After Recent Decline, MercadoLibre Presents an Opportunity\n\nIn 2025, MercadoLibre is expected to generate around $21.65 billion in sales. If we expect a 15% operating margin, which is lower than its 17-year average operating margin of 18%, its operating profit will be $3.25 billion.\n\nSince 2007, the company's earnings yield has fluctuated between -1.25% and 8.25%, averaging at 2% during this period. With an expected earnings yield of 2%, equivalent to 50 times its operating income, MercadoLibre's valuation is projected to reach $162.5 billion by 2025.\n\nApplying an 8% discount rate, the company's enterprise value is estimated to be $139.30 billion. After adding $2 billion in net cash, the equity value should be $141.30 billion. Given 51 million shares outstanding, each share would be worth $2,770 per share, 85% higher than the current price.\n\nConclusion\n\nMercadoLibre has delivered robust performance over the past decade, characterized by consistent revenue growth, a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation. Its dominant position in the Latin American e-commerce and fintech sectors creates a high barrier to entry for potential competitors.\n\nAccording to my analysis, MercadoLibre offers a staggering potential upside of 85%, presenting a great opportunity for long-term growth investors.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "3 Big-Box Retail Stocks That Could Double Your Money by 2030",
        "content": "Some large retail stocks, including many major department stores that are focused on apparel, are struggling. Macy’s (NYSE:M) plans to close 150 stores by 2026. History shows store closings for brick-and-mortar-oriented retailers is often the prelude to tremendous financial struggles and, ultimately, bankruptcy. But more generalized, big-box retail stocks, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), are thriving in the e-commerce era. Luring consumers to their stores with low-cost groceries and other necessities, they subsequently benefit from these shoppers’ decision to purchase more profitable items from them — such as TVs and computer accessories. Moreover, in many cases these big-box retailers have successfully launched e-commerce operations. They are also benefiting from the closure of many department store chains over the years. This should set a number of big-box retailers up for success — and should double your money by 2030. Here are three top retail stocks to buy within the category.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget’s earnings per share jumped almost 50% last year to $8.94, while its operating income surged by nearly $2 billion in 2023. Additionally, its operating margin came in at 5.8% during the holiday season, up from 3.7% during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company has launched a service known as Target Circle 360. The service will be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime and Walmart’s Walmart+.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, Target Circle 360 will offer members free same-day or two-day delivery for orders over $35 — in potentially as little as one hour.\n\nAmazon Prime and Walmart+ have successfully increased online sales for the two retail giants. I expect TGT to benefit from a similar trend in the medium and the long term.\n\nIn February, Goldman Sachs added TGT stock to its Conviction List, citing the retailer’s ability to benefit from strong consumer spending trends and its low valuation.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart’s top line rose by an impressive 5.7% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its global ecommerce sales surged 23% year-over-year. Moreover, its operating income soared 13% year-over-year.\n\nThe large increase in its e-commerce sales indicates that its Walmart+ subscription delivery service is helping the firm and bodes well for the company’s longer-term outlook.\n\nMoreover, WMT has become a leader among retailers when it comes to utilizing AI. The firm’s extensive AI initiatives should help cut costs, streamline customer acquisitions and better serve its existing customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitirecently included WMT in its list of “recommended large-cap stocks.” The shares have a very low enterprise value/Revenue ratio of 0.82 times.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies’ (NYSE:TJX) stores may not be traditionally viewed as big-box retailers.\n\nBut its Marshalls stores are fairly large. Moreover, in my experience the firm often places TJ Maxx stores right next to Home Goods stores. This creates a shopping experience somewhat akin to what Target and Walmart provide.\n\nWhat’s more, like Target and Walmart, TJX’s stores offer low-cost products that entice huge numbers of consumers..\n\nMeanwhile, in a note to investors, investment bank Jefferies predicted that TJX could benefit from Macy’s store closures.\n\nFurther, TJX showed confidence in its own outlook by recently raising its dividend by 13% and pledging to carry out $2 billion to $2.5 billion of share buybacks in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Can Help You Get Richer in 2024",
        "content": "Stocks have been on the rise this year, with the Nasdaq Composite index up 8% since the start of 2024. The growth is a trend that has continued from last year when excitement over tech stocks caused the same index to soar more than 43%.\n\nAdvances in budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) have rallied investors as increased demand for such services has boosted the entire tech market. AI growth will likely continue fueling stocks across the industry in 2024, with dozens of companies and related markets benefiting from its tailwinds.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now.\" And the same goes for investing.\n\nHere are three stocks that can help you get richer in 2024.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has an exciting outlook this year and well into the future. The company supplies its hardware to companies across tech, with its chips powering a wide range of devices from cloud platforms to video game consoles, AI models, custom-built PCs, laptops, and more.\n\nAMD's success in the industry has seen its revenue soar by 240% over the last five years, with its free cash flow up by 306%.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is investing heavily in AI. Last December, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI graphics processing unit (GPU). The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly results suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. AMD EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $5 per share by 2025. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47 yields a share price of $257, projecting stock growth of 51% by next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, AMD is a screaming buy in 2024 as it expands its business and benefits from AI growth.\n\n2. Intel\n\nChip demand across tech is skyrocketing, suggesting you can't have too many chip stocks in your portfolio, and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) is another attractive option.\n\nThe company has hit more than a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 41% over the past three years after decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple\n\nHowever, the fall from grace has seemingly lit a fire under Intel again, and it has been making moves to come back strong in the coming years.Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.\n\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from market leader Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently. INTC EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIntel's earnings are projected to reach just over $2 per share over the next year. When you multiply that figure by the company's forward P/E of 28, you get a share price of $65.\n\nConsidering its current position, these projections would see Intel's stock soar 67% by fiscal 2025, making it a must-buy right now.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has climbed 81% over the last year, making plenty of people richer along the way.\n\nThe company's business has soared over the last decade as it has become a leader in e-commerce and the cloud market, with its annual revenue and operating income up 546% and 20,000% since 2014.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts this year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools, which could lead to a major boost to earnings in the coming years. AMZN EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAccording to the table above, Amazon's earnings could achieve $5 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD and Intel, multiplying that figure by Amazon's forward P/E of 44 yields a stock price of $237, which would see its stock rise 28% by fiscal 2025.\n\nThis projected growth might not be as significant as AMD and Intel, but it would still exceed the S&P 500's 26% rise over the last year. As a result, Amazon is worth considering right now and is a stock that could make you richer in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 High-Growth Biotech Stocks Investors Shouldn’t Sleep On in April",
        "content": "It’s been a volatile start to the second quarter for many sectors. However, investors continue to seek out undervalued biotech stocks for robust returns over the long term. Plenty of options exist in various niches within the biotech sector. That said, investor focus remains on key sectors, including weight-loss drugs, Parkinson’s treatments and drugs aimed at Alzheimer’s.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that biotech stocks are among some of the higher-risk options in the market. These companies’ massive capital spending budgets with uncertain future revenue streams make most stocks very speculative bets by their inherent nature.\n\nBut some stalwarts in key spaces are worth considering for the long haul. Aging demographics and other tailwinds in key areas make these three stocks worth buying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) continues to capitalize on the booming weight loss drug market with Zepbound, targeting the obesity epidemic. Zepbound’s injectable solution is proven to yield significant weight loss for patients, with analysts projecting potential annual revenue of more than $25 billion.\n\nEli Lilly has also partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pharmacy to distribute medications, including Zepbound. LillyDirect offers telehealth consultations for prescriptions and home delivery. The move targets weight-loss drug demand, competing with traditional pharmacies. LillyDirect currently offers 14 medications, with growth plans to expand this assortment.\n\nEli Lilly’s demand for its drug has led to significant Zepbound shortages, which are expected to be seen through the end of this month. This could lead to underwhelming results, given where expectations are for the company’s growth trajectory.\n\nThat said, I think the company’s strong demand for its core weight-loss drug offerings is a sign of immense value creation over the long-term. Those seeking a true winner in the biotech space should consider this stock on any significant dips.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter receiving their approval for their gene therapy project, pharmaceutical giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is raising capital to start production. The company’s pipeline includes a revolutionary cystic fibrosis treatment with a combination of its drugs, Kalydeco and Trikafta. The company anticipates FDA approval for VX-548, expanding the indications beyond cystic fibrosis to other ailments.\n\nVertex has surged over the past year, with a 41% move higher in 2023 alone. Many analysts expect this trend to continue, with the stock’s rise tied to Vertex’s solid financials and a robust drug pipeline. Since its IPO, VRTX stock has outperformed the S&P 500, offering rewarding upside to investors who bought into the company’s innovative drugs and strategic partnerships in its key business segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals launched the late-stage phase II/III AMPLITUDE study on inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease. The study now includes adolescents. It aims to assess kidney function improvement compared to placebo. An interim analysis at week 48 may prompt FDA accelerated approval.\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPioneering some of the most innovative therapies with the help of advanced genetics, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is undoubtedly a biotech stock worth paying attention to. The company has grown drastically since 1980, providing relatively steady growth in this sector. This has allowed Amgen to be among the few biotech stocks to pay dividends, with a 3.3% yield at the time of writing. So, this stock is more than just a growth story – there’s also an income component to consider.\n\nWith a valuation of roughly $145 billion at the time of writing, investors in Amgen benefit from the company’s size and scale. Amgen is another player exploring obesity drugs, with its MariTide offering similar to those provided by its peers (monthly injections). Should Amgen generate significant traction in this market, it could be an under-appreciated stock. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) seems to think so, rendering a conviction buy rating on AMGN stock.\n\nAlthough Amgen faces growth challenges similar to other large-cap pharma names, the company has weathered the storm relatively well. The stock has traded roughly flat over the past year, providing an intriguing entry point for long-term growth and dividend investors to get in right now. The company also fortifies its portfolio against biosimilars with a robust pipeline and international presence. So, for those seeking long-term upside in this sector, this is a company to put on your watch list now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is being hailed as “the new Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).”\n\nThe idea is it has cool cars, it has a clear path toward scaling and profits, and it doesn’t have a crazy CEO. Instead, it has R.J. Scaringe, a 41-year old Florida native and the son of an engineer.\n\nBut as a stock, the new Tesla is not much different from the old one. Shares are down 57% this year, the market cap below $10 billion. The problem isn’t supply, but demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNice Car You Got There\n\nI got to see a Rivian R1T truck in Atlanta recently. It’s impressive and, unlike the Tesla Cybertruck, it looks familiar. That is, until you look inside. Then it becomes very simple indeed. Open the hood and you don’t see an engine, just a front-end trunk.\n\nAll EVs are simple machines. A low-level platform holds the batteries that power it, the motor is just a rotor spinning inside an electromagnet.. The transmission is simple, supporting just 1-2 gears.\n\nAll the moving parts of the EV rest at the platform level, so the top can be anything you want. (The platform is usually called a skateboard.) The R1T looks like a truck because people are accustomed to trucks. Change the body and it’s a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), the R1S. Change it again and it’s a delivery van, which may be more important.\n\nRivian’s main task now is downsizing the platform. A smaller R2 platform will lead to cars costing just $45,000. Rivian believes the even-smaller R3 platform will deliver cars at $35,000. This is what most excited people at its recent press conference. The passenger car version of the R3 is a “crossover,” like my Toyota (NYSE:TM) Scion XB of blessed memory.\n\nReviewers are excited.\n\nGetting From Here to There\n\nRivian’s challenge is getting from the R1 to the R3.\n\nDespite a lot of hype, RIVN stock made fewer than 14,000 vehicles in the last quarter. The production target for 2024 is just 57,000. It’s a tiny fraction of the 387,000 Tesla made, a result that tanked the stock and overwhelmed demand.\n\nRivian lost $5.4 billion last year, ending the year with $7.8 billion in cash. It lost $4.86 billion of cash on operations, raising $3.13 billion, mainly convertible notes.\n\nYou can see why RIVN stock put off development of its Georgia plant, preferring to continue operations in Normal, Illinois, where it has 8,000 employees.\n\nIt doesn’t have the money.\n\nGetting the Cash\n\nKey to getting the cash will be re-tooling the Normal plant for the R2 this summer. The hope is this will result in a gross profit on the cars by the fourth quarter. Half the savings would come from unspecified “design changes, supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs.”\n\nStory continues\n\nA gross profit should raise the stock price, and make stock easier to sell. Tesla now sells at 5 times sales, Rivian at 2 times, because Tesla makes money at scale and Rivian does not.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt’s going to be tight.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has only gotten 10,000 of the 100,000 delivery vans it ordered five years ago. That, and stock purchases from Amazon and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) (Ford has since sold out), put Rivian on the map.\n\nExclusivity on the vans ended late last year, prompting a big order from AT&T (NYSE:T). To get to 2025, Rivian must make money on the vans.\n\nThe van’s design illustrates the hope I still have in the EV market. It’s built on the same skateboard platform as the R1T. As battery costs decline, this simple design will overpower complex ICE machines and change the world.\n\nWhether Rivian will be part of that world will be answered in 2024. If it is, you’re speculating near the lows. If the numbers let it commit to Georgia, then you buy with both hands.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks offer more stability than most stocks. Corporations in this category are profitable, and some of them are still growing at good rates.\n\nWhile the year started off strong, March was a bit slower. The S&P 500 only gained 3% during the month while it gained 5% in February. An April upswing can move blue-chip stocks higher.\n\nIt’s nice to see stocks move higher in one month, but investors should prioritize what a stock will look like after a few years. These blue-chip stocks exhibit promising signs that indicate they have more room for long-term gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a steady record of outperforming the stock market and delivering gains for shareholders. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and offers a 0.71% dividend yield.\n\nThe company’s dominance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries has prompted many analysts to feel bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests an 11% upside. Microsoft is also rated as a “Strong Buy” among 35 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 29% gain from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft Azure continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. This major catalyst grew by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 and contributed to more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue. Cloud computing has also helped Microsoft expand its profit margins. That has led to a lower P/E ratio and high dividend hikes each year. The rising demand of artificial intelligence should increase Microsoft Cloud’s runway.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is an enticing dividend growth stock thanks to its valuation, consistent financial growth, and high-profit margins. The stock has a 20 P/E ratio and a 1.26% dividend yield. American Express recently announced a 17% dividend hike amid good financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 23% year-over-year. American Express also announced that it intends on generating 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects EPS growth rates to range in the mid-teens during the same time.\n\nThese announcements are a part of the company’s growth plan which started in January 2022. American Express generated record revenue and profits in 2023 by adding 12.2 million new cards over the past year. The number of “cards-in-force” issued exceeds 140 million. People will use their credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express offers more insulation than many corporations when the economy slows down.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is an emerging athletic apparel brand that is stealing market share from top competitors. The company’s Hoka and Ugg brands have been a big hit with consumers. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach a record $1.56 billion. The company’s fiscal 2024 revenue guidance suggests it will generate 14% more sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company’s profits grew by 40% year-over-year and helped Deckers Outdoor secure a 25% net profit margin. Ugg has been doing most of the work and reached $1.072 billion in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hola came in second with $429.3 million in revenue but is growing at a faster rate. Ugg brand net sales increased by 15.2% year-over-year while Hoka brand net sales grew by 21.9% year-over-year.\n\nDeckers Outdoor has received more attention ever since it was added to the S&P 500. Even before its inclusion, the stock has comfortably outperformed the market by delivering a 480% gain over the past five years.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells essential home care and grooming products that won’t go out of style during an economic bust. The stock has only delivered a 49% gain over the past five years which is below the S&P 500’s gains during the same time period. However, this blue-chip stock doesn’t experience as much volatility.\n\nPG stock only has a 0.43 beta compared to the S&P 500’s 1.00 beta. Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility. While many growth investors want to forget 2022, Procter & Gamble only lost 7% of its value during that year. The company’s 2.41% dividend yield helped to offset some of those losses.\n\nSpeaking of the dividend, it’s one of the most reliable payouts in the market. Procter & Gamble has distributed dividends for 133 consecutive years. The includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Procter & Gamble has the flexibility to raise prices during inflation and reward long-term investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in the e-commerce industry. Amazon’s vast logistics network makes it easy for most people to receive any product within 1-2 days. The tech giant also has same-day shipping available at some locations.\n\nThe company has a deep moat for its online marketplace, and that competitive advantage resulted in record revenue in Q4 2023. Amazon increased its net sales by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon grew its international revenue by 17% year-over-year while revenue from North America was up by 13% year-over-year.\n\nAmazon also has a competitive moat with its cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services exhibited a 13% year-over-year growth rate to reach $24.2 billion. The company is also expanding into advertising, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. These growth opportunities can result in higher revenue growth and rising profit margins. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has plenty of fans on Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another blue-chip stock to consider after the social media giant has rented its focus on rising profit margins. Analysts have cheered on the company’s recent results and currently view the company as a “Strong Buy.” The highest price target of $609 per share suggests a 16% upside from the current price.\n\nThe stock has been getting more attention due to its recent dividend. Meta Platforms announced its first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth and 201% year-over-year net income growth in that quarter. The dividend was the icing on the cake.\n\nMany advertisers flock to Meta Platforms to reach more of their potential customers. The company has a comfortable lead over other social networks. A TikTok ban would push Meta Platforms higher up on its pedestal. Meta Platforms doesn’t need a controversial TikTok ban to gain market share, but it is a catalysts that investors should monitor.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) offers stability since many people will use credit and debit cards during various economic cycles. These plastic cards are more convenient than carrying around spare change and can also help with credit building (credit cards only) and have enticing rewards programs.\n\nYou aren’t earning 2% cashback if you use paper cash for your purchases, and credit cards let you access money that you currently don’t have. These financial products can put you into a lot of debt, but they are useful for many people.\n\nVisa has been using this formula to deliver impressive returns for shareholders. The stock has gained 7% year-to-date and is up by 74% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.75% dividend yield and has a compounded annual growth rate of 18.18% over the past five years. The stock only has a 21.50% dividend payout ratio, which suggests it has plenty of room to increase its distributions.\n\nThe fintech company also boasts solid financials. Visa reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, DECK, and AMZN.

        "content": "It is valued at nearly $2 trillion already, but Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) sure doesn't seem to be approaching maturity. Wall Street is excited about several of its massive growth initiatives, led by the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) throughout its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.\n\nShares have soared in the past year, jumping 80% compared to the 27% rally in the S&P 500. Yet there's room for further growth ahead for this business, which is valued more like a retailer than a tech specialist right now. Let's look at why you might want to pick up a few shares of Amazon while they're priced at less than $200.\n\nThe attractive services platform\n\nIt's hard to overstate the success that Amazon is having with its cloud services platform. Enterprises are increasingly putting more work onto its system, with demand being lifted by new AI functionality.\n\nAWS expanded at a 13% rate in the most recent quarter to cross $24 billion in revenue. Sure, Microsoft's Azure platform is growing more quickly. But Amazon is fully participating in the booming market for enterprise services and AI.\n\n\"[N]ew [AI] capabilities like Bedrock, Q, and Trainium have resonated with customers and are starting to be reflected in our overall results,\" CEO Andy Jassy said in an early-February press release.\n\nHigher margins\n\nOne of the biggest knocks against Amazon's stock is the company's low profit margin. It's a byproduct of the tech titan's e-commerce business, which requires lots of capital to maintain and is situated in the competitive online retail space. Amazon's best operating margin performance in the past decade has only been about 6% of sales, in fact, compared to the 30%-plus rate generated by Meta Platforms and Apple. AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon finally seems ready to break out of that profitability slump. Operating income more than tripled in 2023 to $37 billion. The AWS segment made the biggest contribution to that boost, but it was also powered by Amazon's expanding digital advertising business and several other innovations that are early on in their growth stories.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"[O]ur teams are delivering at a rapid clip, and we have a lot in front of us to be excited about,\" Jassy said.\n\nThe surest path toward continued positive momentum for the stock is through Amazon's profit margin moving toward -- and eventually past -- 10% of sales.\n\nThe price is right\n\nAmazon's collection of businesses is unique, making it hard to compare its valuation directly against peers. Yet there's a good chance that Wall Street is undervaluing the company even after the stock's recent rally.\n\nShares exchange hands for less than 4 times sales, which puts the stock's price closer to Costco's premium of 1.3 times revenue than to Apple's premium of 7 times sales. Amazon's weak profitability means it deserves a lower valuation than pure tech peers like Microsoft and Apple, of course, but it should close that gap as its annual earnings power expands in the coming years.\n\nInvestors who'd rather watch the stock for now should follow Amazon's operating income and the pace of growth in the AWS platform for more signs of further improvements. A stumble in either category could push shares lower and produce a more attractive buying opportunity. If you don't mind taking on some risk, meanwhile, consider owning Amazon stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-And Action! Amazon leans into video in emerging Europe's online marketplace fight",
        "content": "By Anna Koper and Michael Kahn\n\nWARSAW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Amazon and Temu are taking different tacks to challenge Poland's online marketplace leader Allegro, with the U.S. e-commerce giant leaning into video and the fashion-focused Chinese company relying on low prices to win customers.\n\nThe two retailers see opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe's biggest economy and the region as a whole, where growth rates are set to outpace those of more mature Western markets as incomes rise and more shoppers move online.\n\nAmazon plans to add more original Polish-language shows to the five it has launched on its Prime Video service since 2023, its country manager for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and expansion markets Rocco Braeuniger told Reuters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Where we have seen a good response was Prime Video and we will double down on this,\" he said. \"We will invest in Prime Video and local productions within the region.\"\n\nAmazon's documentary about soccer star Robert Lewandowski is its most-watched title ever in Poland.\n\nAmazon Prime, which includes video-streaming alongside other services, costs 49 zlotys a year in Poland. Most Polish subscribers use the video benefit, which the company sees as key to attracting and keeping users, Braeuniger said.\n\nAmazon, whose Alexa voice-assistant software was developed at its technology centre in the Polish city of Gdansk, also plans to invest more across the region, including in logistics.\n\n\"We see a tremendous growth potential in CEE,\" Braeuniger said.\n\nROOM TO GROW\n\nIndustry bodies EuroCommerce and Ecommerce Europe recently valued the overall European online market at 900 billion euros ($975 billion), of which 67% was in Western Europe.\n\nCentral and Eastern European countries accounted for just 8% and 2% of total turnover respectively, leaving plenty of room for growth.\n\nOnline marketplace sales in Poland, with nearly 40 million people, are dominated by Allegro, which was founded in 1999 and made its debut on the Warsaw stock exchange in 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon entered the Polish market in 2021.\n\nChina's Temu - owned by PDD Holdings - followed in 2023 and quickly gobbled up market share to lap Amazon with low-cost fashion offerings that have helped make the discounter into a global e-commerce behemoth.\n\n\"We have received encouraging feedback from consumers in the CEE region,\" Temu said in a statement.\n\nIn February, Amazon had almost 5.9 million users in Poland, lagging far behind Allegro, with 18.2 million, and Temu's 13.7 million, according to Mediapanel Gemius Polska and PBI data quoted by news agency PAP Biznes.\n\nPawel Szpigiel, an analyst at DM mBank, said Allegro's loyal customer base and wide range of services made it a tough market leader to unseat but that Amazon's ability to build slowly and Temu's capacity to compete on prices posed a potential threat.\n\n\"Allegro definitely can't sleep peacefully because the e-commerce market is very dynamic, as evidenced by the success of Temu around the world,\" Szpigiel said.\n\n\"Amazon's strategy is different and has always been different from that of Chinese companies,\" he added. \"Amazon has a strategy of very long trench warfare.\"\n\nCLOSE TO CUSTOMERS\n\nProximity to its customers has helped Allegro defend its leading position in Poland and push its flagship brand into the neighbouring Czech Republic in 2023 and Slovakia this year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Eastick told Reuters.\n\nThe company - which operates in six countries following the acquisition of Mall.CZ - plans to launch the Allegro brand in Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia in 2024.\n\n\"Our strength, especially in a place like the Czech Republic or Slovakia, is that they're adjacent markets to Poland,\" Eastick said. \"The Polish merchant offering is not a perfect match for tastes in those countries, but it's pretty close.\"\n\nBut competing against deep-pocketed Amazon could weigh. Trigon analyst Dominik Niszcz forecasts that Allegro's 2024 adjusted EBITDA loss from international operations could top 500 million zlotys, depending on expenses in the fourth quarter related to entering the Hungarian market.\n\nAnother challenge in the region has been inflation, which has ranked among the highest in the European Union and pushed consumers to keep a tighter grip on their spending.\n\nPoland's annual inflation in peaked at 18.4% in February 2023 and has since eased to 1.9%, although analysts expect it to tick up again due to the government scrapping the zero value-added tax rate on food and potentially unfreezing energy prices.\n\nSome analysts also point to Poland's relatively low household savings rate, saying private consumption could recover more slowly if households opt to first rebuild their savings cushion, something Allegro's Eastick also identified as a risk.\n\n\"The recovery (in consumption) seems to be coming a bit slower than the economists expect. So we're cautious from that perspective,\" Eastick said.\n\nNevertheless, \"this year we will also be in a good position to benefit from the move back towards discretionary spending\", he added.\n\n($1 = 0.9230 euros)\n\n(Writing by Michael Kahn, Additional reporting by Anna Pruchnicka in Gdansk and Karol Badohal in Warsaw; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best penny stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nThe markets were off to an impressive start in 2024, driven by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will embark on interest rate cuts. However, data is now showing that inflation remains sticky and the labor market tight, causing new concerns regarding the Fed's possible path towards rate cuts. In this environment it makes sense to look towards masters of the money game.\n\nKen Griffin is one of the hedge fund managers well-positioned to benefit from the ever-evolving financial landscape. The mastermind behind Citadel Investment Group, which he founded in 1990 with $4.2 million, continues to experience a surge in success. The legendary investor set a record with a remarkable return of 153% in 2022 as he got everything right with his strategic bets on inflation and interest rates.\n\nWith a portfolio value of over $460 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street's most tracked hedge funds, consistently surpassing 25% annual returns since 2016. While the hedge fund operates several portfolio funds, its lead fund is Wellington, which invests in various asset classes and sectors as part of its diversification strategy.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin’s flagship Wellington fund delivered 38% returns above the 26% returns that it delivered in 2021, upon topping the 24% gain in 2020. The fund was also up 19.4% in 2019, more than double the 9.1% gain in 2018.\n\nGriffin's hedge fund deploys a multi-strategy investing method that allows it to take advantage of long and short-term investment opportunities. In 2023, when the hedge fund industry came under immense pressure and ended up averaging a 4.4% gain, Citadel outperformed the entire industry, delivering solid returns of 15.3%.\n\nThe flagship fund had an excellent start to 2024, achieving a 1.9% increase in the first month as all employed strategies across commodities, equities, fixed income, credit, and quantitative sectors yielded positive results. Griffin expects the momentum to continue throughout the year as he remains bullish about the US economy amid the expected interest rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Federal Reserve can start cutting rates this summer, and we will see unemployment increase slightly. But the overall economy looks pretty damn good right now,” Griffin said at the MFA Network event in Miami. “This is a real change in mindset from where we were September, October last year.”\n\nCitadel Group generated a profit of $7 billion in 2023. Nevertheless, it was an underperformance, considering a 38% profit jump in 2022 to $16 billion. Similarly, Citadel Investment Group has kept its tradition of returning significant value to shareholders. It has returned over $25 billion since 2018.\n\nGriffin's impressive performance in the market has everything to do with his focus on large-cap, high-growth stocks. Citadel Investment Group boasts significant holding in the magnificent 7 stocks led by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stocks posted double-digit gains in 2023.\n\nAmid the aggressive investment style focusing on high-growth technology stocks, Griffin is also a value investor who often looks for opportunities in small-cap and penny stocks. With a net worth of $35 billion, the billionaire investor employs 18,000 people to scan the best high-risk reward opportunities. 13 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned billionaire Griffin's portfolio and picked 13 penny stocks he's holding. We also checked price targets of these stocks set by Wall Street analysts and mentioned upside potential of these equities based on these targets.

The sector is attracting a lot of speculation, which can risk the loss of capital. However, some AI stocks are the real deal and look ready to deliver long-term returns for their shareholders.\n\nIt’s not too late to invest in the best AI stocks to buy. These are some of the stocks that you may want to monitor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

The company has an excellent recurring revenue model that grew by 34% year-over-year (YoY) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

Cybersecurity firms are fortifying their defenses with AI tool offerings.\n\nCrowdStrike recently launched Charlotte AI, which allows cybersecurity teams to streamline their work and detect threats more quickly. A customer survey revealed the average person saves two hours per day with the company’s generative AI solution.

On Good Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted that higher-than-expected strength in job gains and inflation may delay or reduce interest rate cuts in 2024, markets again sold off interest rate-sensitive stocks such as REITs.\n\nDespite the latest disappointment, there was some good news last week, as analysts upgraded several REITs and raised price targets on many others while still maintaining previous ratings.\n\nTake a look at four REITs that analysts at Bank of America Securities recently upgraded.\n\nTanger Inc. (NYSE:SKT), formerly Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 40 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls with 15.6 million square feet and over 3,000 stores across 20 states and Canada. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers was founded in 1981 and had its initial public offering (IPO) in May 1993. Tanger's occupancy rate at the end of 2023 was 97.3%.\n\nOn Feb. 15, Tanger reported excellent fourth-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.52 beat the estimate of $0.50. Revenue of $127.48 million beat the estimate of $119.04 million and was 9.46% above revenue from the fourth quarter of 2022 of $116.46 million. Additionally, full-year core FFO was announced in a range from $2.01-$2.09 per share, with a midpoint above the analyst consensus estimate of $2.03 per share.\n\nTanger was the second-leading REIT overall in 2023, with a total return of 63.58%, negating the popular notion that in-store retail shopping has lost out to Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online websites.\n\nOn April 5, Bank of America Securities analyst Jeffrey Spector upgraded Tanger from Underperform to Neutral and raised the price target 29.1% from $24 to $31. On March 22, Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman also upgraded Tanger from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $30 to $33.\n\nStory continues\n\nAcadia Realty Trust (NYSE:AKR) is a Rye, New York-based retail REIT with 189 properties (as of the fourth quarter of 2023) across centralized urban areas in 22 states and Washington, D.C. The overall lease rate is approximately 95% with annual rent increases of 3%.\n\nOn April 5, Bank of America Securities analyst Craig Schmidt upgraded Acadia Realty Trust from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target by 11.1% from $18 to $20. This upgrade could not have come at a better time, as many retail REITs, including Acadia Realty, were getting hit hard last week following Powell's remarks.\n\nAcadia will announce its first-quarter 2024 earnings on April 29.\n\nEssex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE:ESS) is a residential REIT that owns and operates 252 apartment communities with 62,000 units in the West Coast states of California and Washington. Essex Property Trust is a member of the S&P 500 and a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nOn March 25, Essex Property Trust acquired JV Partner's 49.9% interest in four apartment communities, with 1,480 units for a total purchase price of $505 million.\n\nOn April 1, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein upgraded Essex Property Trust from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target by 10% from $250 to $275.\n\nAnalyst price targets vary widely. Within the past two weeks, Truist Securities has maintained a Hold on Essex with a $259 price target, and Piper Sandler has maintained an Overweight position and a $291 price target.\n\nHealthpeak Properties Inc. (NYSE:DOC) is an El Segundo, California-based diversified healthcare REIT that owns and operates private-pay facilities such as life science centers, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Although it has properties across the country, most are in the San Francisco, San Diego and Boston areas.\n\nHealthpeak's IPO was created in 1985, and it was added to the S&P 500 in 2008. It owns 477 properties totaling over 50 million square feet with over 2,500 tenants, worth over $20 billion.\n\nOn March 1, Healthpeak officially merged with Physicians Realty Trust in an all-stock-for-stock transaction.\n\nOn April 1, Bank of America Securities analyst Dennerlein upgraded Healthpeak Properties from Underperform to Buy, while raising the price target 38.8% from $18 to $25.\n\nHealthpeak will announce its first-quarter 2024 earnings on April 26.\n\nExplore Opportunities Beyond REITs\n\nWhile publicly traded REITs offer a convenient way to invest in real estate, we believe that some of the most compelling opportunities lie in the private market.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Chinese Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "China is home to one of the biggest economies in the world, and after lifting its long, strict COVID regulations, it is on the rebound. Despite slow growth in the second half of last year, which caused many stocks to take a hit, some stocks have still persevered and produced excellent results.\n\nThese three Chinese stocks have managed to overcome the economic difficulties affecting industries and continue to hold some of the best buy ratings for this year. Investors should consider these stocks for their potential with growing market shares and dominant selling performances in their respective sectors.\n\nLet’s learn about these stocks’ resilience, growth prospects and reassuring financials, which have earned them Strong Buy ratings and should put them at the top of investors’ lists this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPDD Holdings(PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) owns and operates some of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and the world. Its most popular platform is Temu, which has the second-most monthly users behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPDD took a slight hit earlier this year, but after a Q4 earnings beat, the stock saw a considerable boost. Investors were excited by the company’s Q4 revenue of $12.52 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.40.\n\nThis stock’s Strong Buy ratings also come from the optimistic consensus estimates. The company is predicted to see a 35% increase in earnings growth this year and a significant jump in revenue on top of its rebound.\n\nPDD has a dominant hold over the e-commerce market in China and continues to show impressive growth. Investors should buy now and watch as this stock takes off this year.\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is another e-commerce giant based in China. Like many competitors, Alibaba has seen its fair share of trouble alongside the struggling Chinese economy. However, estimates remain confident that this stock will be among the first to return to the top with a hopeful 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese estimates are fueled by Alibaba’s extensive market share and continued performance despite the hurdles standing in its way. The most recent quarterly earnings report boasts $36.669 billion in revenue, showing a 5% growth from the previous year.\n\nWhile it’s not the best growth, considering the economic pressure, Alibaba has showcased some of the best perseverance out of Chinese stocks. In addition, to reignite its stock price, Alibaba shared its massive share buyback initiative involving repurchasing 524 million ordinary shares during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nWith its low price, now is a great time to buy Alibaba, believing in its proven ability to make an exciting return this year.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the significant Chinese competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) reported a fantastic 2023 despite economic slowdowns and high spending. In Q4, Li Auto reported a 133.8% increase in sales from Q4 2022.\n\nThe show didn’t stop there. Not only did Li Auto see an 182.2% increase in deliveries, but it also reported a free cash flow of $6.22 billion in 2023, a 1,861.8 % year-over-year increase. That’s enormous growth despite much higher operating expenses following its first fully electric EV release.\n\nThat cash flow, in line with Li Auto’s current price, makes it a criminally underrated stock, with a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 6.5. Though the company does not expect as massive of growth this year as 2023, many other EV makers report the same.\n\nAll things considered, Li Auto is too good of a deal and has prospects too promising for investors to pass up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Lim is a finance freelance writer who writes content for several companies like LTSE and Realtor, along with financial publications, including Mises Institute and Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "George Soros’ Favorite Picks: 3 Stocks the Billionaire Keeps Buying",
        "content": "George Soros’ hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund’s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price.\n\nWhat follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC.\n\niShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) An investor's analyzing the russell 2000 etf fund on a screen. A phone shows the prices of Russell 2000. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.\n\nWhile the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of “small-cap.” The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market’s top performers over the past year, it’s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAerCap Holdings (AER) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn’t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months.\n\nThe Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street’s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view.\n\nSoros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far.\n\nWall Street’s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, “Given the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant’s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97.\n\nAlphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundationsold off their respective stakes.\n\nIt’s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet’s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars.\n\nAlso, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He’s been investing for over 80 years so there are bound to be a few blow ups along the way.\n\nWhat can we learn from his biggest mistakes?\n\n3 Biggest Value Investing Mistakes\n\n1.       Buying in a difficult industry where there are few moats\n\n2.       Holding the company too long, even when the business has changed or its not performing\n\n3.       Buying an expensive stock\n\nBuffett’s Hits, Misses and Mistakes\n\n1. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of IBM in 2011 around $170 a share. By 2018, Berkshire had sold out of the investment in the range of $140 to $150. Berkshire took a loss.\n\nBuffett later said IBM wasn’t performing as he thought it would and that’s why he got out. But it took him 8 years to finally exit the position completely. During that period, IBM’s earnings fell year-over-year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 with little rebound in 2017 and 2018.\n\nShould Buffett had sold earlier when falling earnings became more than just a 1-off at IBM?\n\n2. Bank of America (BAC)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought Bank of America in the third quarter of 2017. It still owns a big position.\n\nEarnings at Bank of America popped during the pandemic, rising to $3.56 in 2021 from $1.87 in 2020. But earnings are expected to fall this year by 9%.\n\nBank of America is still cheap with a P/B ratio of just 1.1.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Buffett making a mistake in still holding Bank of America?\n\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought Amazon shares in the first quarter of 2019. It’s a small position in the equity portfolio. At the time, many were confused by the purchase because Amazon sported a sky-high P/E ratio and didn’t seem to be a traditional “value” stock.\n\nAmazon is cheaper now, with a forward P/E of 44. Earnings plunged in 2022, but they have been rebounding. In 2023, Amazon made $2.80 per share and the Zacks Consensus is looking for $4.08 in 2024.\n\nShares are up 105.2% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 through Apr 2, 2024. That’s beating the S&P 500, up 84.4% during the same time.\n\nWas Amazon too expensive when Buffett bought it in 2019?\n\n4. Chevron Corp. (CVX)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Chevron in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then bought a bigger position in 2021. At the time, Chevron was dirt cheap on a fundamental basis. It remains cheap, with a forward P/E of 12.\n\nChevron shares are up 90.3% since the last day of the fourth quarter of 2020. That easily beats the return of the S&P 500 during that same time of 39.1%.\n\nDoes it pay to buy the dirt-cheap stocks like Chevron over the long term?\n\n5. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in the first quarter of 2016. It has since become a cornerstone of the Berkshire business and is the largest position in the equity portfolio.\n\nShares are no longer cheap, however. When Berkshire originally bought, Apple was trading around 10x forward earnings. It is currently trading at 25.8x. But earnings growth has stalled out the last few years.\n\nApple made $6.11 in fiscal 2022 and $6.12 in fiscal 2023. It’s expected to see some growth in fiscal 2024 as the Zacks Consensus is looking for $6.55.\n\nIs Apple flashing the warnings signs that maybe it’s business is changing?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Learning from Buffett’s Investing Mistakes?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN and CVX in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amazon.com, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Jeffrey Bezos (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$211b stake in this US$1.9t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There's been a surge in tech stocks over the last year, which has seen the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rise 47% in the last 12 months. Increased interest in budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) has rallied investors, sending countless stocks skyrocketing. Suffice it to say that AI has created a lot of millionaires over the last year. Meanwhile, the sector has shown no signs of slowing.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The trajectory will see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, suggesting that the market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling and it's not too late to invest in AI.\n\nSo, here are three millionaire-maker artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nYou might be sick of hearing about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by now. The company has featured in countless headlines over the last year as bullish investors have sent its stock rising 218% since last April. However, all eyes have been on this chipmaker for good reason, and it likely still has much to offer new investors thanks to its powerful position in AI.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia captured an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models. The company got a head start compared to its rivals, which has likely secured its dominance in the budding market for years.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia remains on a promising growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates seem to support its potential. Data by YCharts.\n\nThe chart above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Considering the overwhelming demand for GPUs over the next couple of years, I'd expect the forward P/E to hover around similar levels under similar macro-economic conditions. So multiplying the expected 2026 EPS by its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,296 -- an upside of 48% form current priec levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 46% over the next two years. The company may not replicate last year's growth, but it would still beat the S&P 500's 15% growth since 2022.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLike Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) role as a leading chipmaker gives it massive potential in AI. The company's stock has climbed 85% over the last year, rallying Wall Street with its growing prospects in the industry.\n\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party as Nvidia beat it to the market. However, AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in AI over the long term.\n\nLast December, AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly earnings suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. Data by YCharts.\n\nAMD's earnings are projected to reach $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. Again like Nvidia, I expect AMD's forward P/E of 50 to continue hovering at similar levels which implies a share price of $350 by 2026, and by extension, a doubling of stock price from today's levels.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nShares in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have risen 77% in the last year, no doubt creating millionaires along the way.\n\nThe company has leading positions in multiple tech areas, including e-commerce, the cloud market, gaming, consumer products, and more. However, all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nAmazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but it also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. Data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon's earnings are expected to reach nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia and AMD, multiplying that figure by the retail giant's forward P/E of 43 yields a stock price of $301, which could see its shares increase by 65% by fiscal 2026.\n\nAs a result, Amazon is a millionaire-maker stock worth considering in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $539,230!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation",
        "content": "Technology stocks have driven the S&P 500 higher over the past year or so, leading the index out of bear territory and to a record high earlier this year, confirming we are indeed in a bull market. These types of markets favor growth stocks, so it's likely technology players will hold onto the momentum and climb higher in the months to come.\n\nSome already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.)\n\nLet's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared more than 200% over the past year on optimism about its dominance in the AI chip market. The company holds about 80% share, and thanks to its increases in research and development spending, and its pledge to continue releasing more and more powerful chips, its leadership is likely to last.\n\nJust recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year.\n\nAmong these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's chip dominance has helped its earnings to soar over the past few years, and in the most recent quarter, revenue and net income rose in the triple digits. Considering this track record and the strengths I mention above, the stock seems reasonably priced at 34 times forward-earnings estimates today.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) shares have climbed more than 130% in a year as the company emerges from a period of cost cuts and ramps up investment in growth. And this growth includes a focus on AI, Meta's biggest investment area this year.\n\nYou probably know Meta more for its social media platforms than for its presence in the world of AI. The company owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and every day more than 3.1 billion people use at least one of these apps. Meta has a rock-solid moat, or competitive advantage, thanks to this brand strength, and that keeps its biggest source of revenue -- advertisers -- coming back to reach users of these apps.\n\nThis has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend.\n\nMeta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has advanced about 70% over the past year as the company emerges from a difficult period and shows it has what it takes to win over the long term.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade.\n\nMoving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term.\n\nThat's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Two years after its historic win, a divided Amazon Labor Union lurches toward a leadership election",
        "content": "Two years after clinching a historic victory at a warehouse in New York City, the first labor union for Amazon workers in the United States is divided, running out of money and fighting over an election that could determine who will lead the group in the near future.\n\nDespite campaigns at several facilities in the past few years, the warehouse on Staten Island still is the only site in the U.S. where the retail giant's workers have voted in favor of union representation. Cracks emerged within the Amazon Labor Union ranks after it lost the votes at a second Staten Island warehouse and at one in upstate New York, spurring disagreements about the group's organizing strategy.\n\nSome felt Chris Smalls, the union’s president, spent too much time traveling and giving speeches instead of focusing on Staten Island, where the union still does not have a contract with Amazon. Prominent members resigned quietly or left to form a dissident labor group, which sued the union in federal court last summer to force an election for new leadership.\n\nAlthough many of the union’s problems are internal, it also continues to face roadblocks from Amazon, which has resisted efforts to come to the bargaining table despite pressure from federal labor regulators to do so.\n\nThe company, for its part, has accused the National Labor Relations Board and the ALU of improperly influencing the outcome of the successful unionization vote. Amazon also claims the results - 2,654 in favor and 2,131 against - do not represent what the majority of employees want. About 8,300 people worked at the JFK8 Fulfillment Center at the time of the April 2022 vote.\n\n“When the law allows management to drag out negotiations over years, and to use legal arguments to delay the progress that the workers have begun, it’s just an enormous hurdle,” said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University.\n\nIn January, months after the splinter group called A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus filed its lawsuit, the union agreed to a court-brokered plan to allow rank-and-file members to vote on whether to hold an election for a slate of new officers. For five days that ended in early March, tables with ballots were set up outside the doors of the massive Staten Island warehouse. Smalls and other union leaders campaigned against the election, but the vote didn’t go their way.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn court documents, Arthur Schwartz, an attorney who represents the dissident caucus, said that of the roughly 350 union members who voted, 60% favored having an officer election in June or July.\n\nThe referendum, which had a low turnout rate, didn’t settle the legal back-and-forth and internal power plays. Last week, Jeanne Mirer, an attorney for the union, argued in a legal filing that the federal court in New York should reopen the court-brokered plan. She called it a “flawed” agreement that violated the union’s constitution.\n\nAccording to Mirer, the current ALU governing document requires members to pass an amendment or arrange a constitutional convention if they want to hold an officer election before a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated with Amazon. The current leaders also say the union has run out of money, which makes it challenging for them to conduct an election.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who’s in the chair,” Mirer said during an interview. “Anybody who is a leader has to get Amazon to the table, and working against each other isn’t going to do it.”\n\nSchwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, called the union’s legal claims “totally baseless,” arguing that the constitution at issue was imposed by Smalls – without a vote - in late 2022. He noted that the neutral monitor overseeing the implementation of the court-brokered plan - labor attorney Richard Levy - has scheduled candidate nomination meetings for May, which could allow an internal election to be held as early as June 11.\n\nSmalls, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the union during the coronavirus pandemic, did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Last year, he told the New York Times that he traveled to help raise money for the union. He also told financial news website Business Insider in December that he would not seek reelection as ALU president.\n\nMeanwhile, two other prominent organizers, Connor Spence, the union’s co-founder and former treasurer, and Michelle Valentin Nieves, the union’s former vice president, have thrown their hats in the ring. Amazon fired Spence last year for violating a company policy that forbids workers from accessing company buildings or outdoor work areas when they’re off the clock, a policy critics say is designed to hinder organizing. He's leading the A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus, while Valentin Nieves is running her own independent campaign.\n\nValentin Nieves, who helps run the conveyor belts at the warehouse that unionized, said she felt frustrated during her time as an ALU officer by how much Smalls traveled, alleging that he missed weekly financial meetings for five months straight. She said she spoke with him about reducing his time away and encouraged him to periodically go to public bus stop near the warehouse, where many workers gathered after their shifts ended. But she said Smalls didn’t take her advice.\n\n“We need someone that is here. We need a contract and we need to organize the building,” Valentin Nieves said. “If we’re not able to do this, it’s going to have a domino effect, and a lot of Amazon workers are going to lose hope.”\n\nOne Amazon worker on Staten Island, Keanu Rivera, 28, said he voted in favor of the union two years ago and sometimes reads the emails he receives from the labor group. Rivera said he used to see organizers talking to workers all the time before the representation vote two years ago.\n\nThese days, he says there’s not much of that, a problem exacerbated by the Amazon policy restricting off-duty activity in work areas.\n\n“It’s all Amazon,” Rivera said. “Amazon got the money to stall them.”\n\nIn addition to the vigorous legal pushback against the union’s win, the company has continued to spend millions on labor consultants who often try to persuade workers against joining a union. In 2023 alone, Amazon spent more than $3 million on such consultants for its delivery network, a target of the Teamsters union.\n\nLast month, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Amazon, alleging the company illegally attempted to disrupt organizing efforts by an independent union associated with the ALU at an air hub in Kentucky. Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said that complaint was “without merit.”\n\n“We will continue to defend our position as the legal process continues,” Paradis said.\n\nBack in New York, organizers pushing for the internal election have their work cut out for them. They still need to secure a new mailing list for all the workers at the Staten Island warehouse, which has high turnover. Schwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, has asked the court to intervene so candidates whom the NLRB determined were illegally fired, such as Spence, can campaign in non-work areas of Amazon's property.\n\n“The hope of the caucus,\" he said, “is that we really use the election process to reenergize people in the plant.”",

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Shopify vs. Amazon",
        "content": "The e-commerce industry has undoubtedly made room for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), but outside these e-commerce ties, the companies have less in common than one might think. Amazon is an online seller with a tech business, while Shopify is more of a software business.\n\nHence, both companies approach e-commerce from different angles, meaning their investment cases differ significantly. However, after looking at both companies, one should stand out as the more lucrative investment.\n\nComparing Amazon and Shopify\n\nAs mentioned, the most apparent difference in these businesses is that only one of them, Amazon, is an e-retailer. Amazon pioneered e-commerce in the U.S. It started by selling books, but over time, evolved into a retailer that \"sells everything.\"\n\nWhile it has become the second-largest retailer in the U.S., the company actually earns its income from other businesses. Amazon's primary source of operating income is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing arm. Moreover, even in its retail segments, businesses such as digital advertising, subscriptions, and online seller services are much larger growth drivers than online sales.\n\nIn contrast, Shopify is not an e-retailer. It developed a fast, highly customizable platform that enables merchants of all sizes to show and sell their products online. It has also ventured into ancillary services such as raising capital, processing payments, and managing inventory for items that sell both online and offline.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon has existed longer than Shopify. It was founded in 1994, versus 2006 for Shopify. Amazon has capitalized on a longer existence and rapid growth to become a much larger company. As a result, Amazon has risen to a market cap of almost $1.9 trillion, approximately 19 times larger than Shopify's market cap of just under $100 billion.\n\nAmazon and Shopify, financially speaking\n\nDespite its large size, Amazon continues to maintain a relatively rapid growth rate. This is mostly because of the smaller, high-margin businesses under its umbrella, which contrast with the low margins and slower growth rate of its massive online sales business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, its $575 billion in revenue grew 12% from last year's levels. Retailing and cloud computing suffered a downturn in 2022. However, profitability recovered in 2023, with net income coming in at $30 billion, well above the $2.7 billion loss in 2022.\n\nA smaller size worked in Shopify's favor, as its $7.1 billion in revenue increased 26% yearly. Nonetheless, its logistics businesses, which it sold last May, weighed on profitability. As a result, it earned just $132 million in net income in 2023, with its Q4 income of $657 million exceeding the yearly total. Shopify lost nearly $3.5 billion in 2022.\n\nThose struggles may explain why Amazon's stock rose faster than Shopify's over the last 12 months. Still, on a five-year timeline, Shopify far outperformed the e-commerce conglomerate. SHOP Chart\n\nWith that performance, Shopify is a comparatively more expensive stock. It sells at a pricey forward P/E ratio of 73. In contrast, Amazon, which rarely sells at a low multiple, trades at just 42 times forward earnings, a differential that could strengthen the case for Amazon amid the higher returns more recently.\n\nAmazon or Shopify?\n\nUltimately, both stocks should beat the market as their technology continues to attract more business. Still, while risk-averse investors might prefer Amazon, investors with some appetite for risk should lean toward Shopify.\n\nShopify has grown revenue at a faster pace over time, and the decision to sell the logistics business has again made it a profitable company.\n\nMoreover, even without a logistics arm, Shopify has an ecosystem that will help it attract more merchants and upsell additional services. Now that the company has again turned profitable, the faster revenue growth should translate into larger earnings increases, a factor that should drive the stock price higher at a more rapid pace.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Here Are My 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The U.S. stock market has been exceptionally volatile since 2020, mainly due to the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing economic uncertainties, and geopolitical tensions. However, despite the tumultuous economic environment, many technology stocks have posted eye-popping returns.\n\nIncreasing adoption of remote work, online shopping, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has played a major role in driving technology stocks. With investors keen on capitalizing on the digital transformation trend, here are my three top technology picks that are well suited to deliver solid long-term returns in the coming years.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nShares of technology giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have surged by roughly 50% in the past year. In late January, the company posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with revenue and earnings surpassing analyst estimates.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company's investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI continue to be the talk of the town. Microsoft has successfully integrated OpenAI's technologies across its suite of products, rapidly acquiring new customers and significant productivity gains.\n\nAzure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, has emerged as a major beneficiary of the company's AI strategy. Azure closed the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, with an estimated 24% share of the market, up 2 percentage points from a year earlier. Customers have been opting for Azure to simplify and speed up their cloud migrations. Microsoft says furthermore that Azure's OpenAI service is being increasingly used by several AI-first start-ups as well as over half of the Fortune 500 companies. Microsoft had 53,000 Azure AI customers at the end of the second quarter, of which over one-third were new to the Azure platform.\n\nGoing beyond Azure, Microsoft's AI-powered assistant, CoPilot, is increasing efficiency and productivity for user of its Microsoft 365 cloud-native productivity platform and GitHub software development platform. CoPilot played a major role in driving Github revenue up over 40% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the adoption of AI technologies has fast-tracked Microsoft's growth strategy, the company's broad geographic presence and diversified product portfolio are also additional reasons to like the stock. The company also boasts a solid balance sheet, with $81 billion in cash and $58.7 billion in free cash flow.\n\nLooking at the long-term potential of Microsoft's AI-powered businesses and solid financial position, the stock seems like a smart buy now.\n\nAmazon\n\nAnother stock looking quite exceptional now is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which also managed to deliver solid revenue and earnings beats in the fourth quarter of 2023. Amazon saw a whopping 383% year-over-year jump in operating income to $13.2 billion. This also played a major role in driving trailing-12-month free cash flow to $35.5 billion at the end of the year, up $48.3 billion on a year-over-year basis.\n\nDespite increasing competition from Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud infrastructure space with a 31% market share. AWS has been growing at a double-digit rate and is on the way to an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. AWS' robust security and access control capabilities have proved to be a key differentiator in attracting customers for long-term projects.\n\nAmazon is also rapidly infusing new features and generative AI technologies in AWS, which uses Nvidia chips as well as its own custom-designed AI chips to provide computation power for AI workloads. Amazon has launched the Bedrock fully managed service to enable clients to access a large number of its foundational models as well as those from other AI players to build proprietary AI applications. AWS also offers a coding companion, Amazon Q, to assist developers and provide valuable insights from multiple data sources.\n\nAmazon is ready to rake in profits from its world-leading e-commerce business. The company's focus on delivery speeds is translating into higher purchase frequency by Prime members. An increasing percentage of third-party sellers is also helping strengthen the company's e-commerce business. Finally, Amazon is monetizing its online platform beyond product sales by offering targeted and relevant advertising to sellers and customers.\n\nAs the leader in multiple high-growth markets, there seems to be plenty of growth yet to come for Amazon.\n\nConfluent\n\nConfluent's (NASDAQ: CFLT) platform enables storage as well as processing and analysis of large amounts of streaming data, empowering clients to derive actionable insights for informed decision-making. Forrester recognized Confluent as a leader among streaming data platforms in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Confluent Cloud cloud-based platform has emerged as a major growth catalyst and is being increasingly adopted by digital-native customers, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. Confluent Cloud saw its revenue reach $100 million for the first time in the fourth quarter, up 46% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nConfluent's recent financial performance underlines the resilience of its business model. After seeing its shares crash due to weak guidance given in the third quarter, the company made a solid comeback with stellar results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue and earnings surpassed consensus estimates. Furthermore, the company also achieved its first positive non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin of 5.3% in the fourth quarter, up 27 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.\n\nWhile free cash flow was negative in 2023, Confluent expects it to break even in 2024. Plus, the company is currently focusing on a target addressable market of over $60 billion. With an annual revenue run rate of just $777 million, there is still much runway left for the company.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 4, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors. Manali Pradhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon, Confluent, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the largest labor force in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go to the 5 Countries with the Largest Labor Force in the World.\n\nA large and skilled labor force is pivotal in driving a country's economy. According to data by the World Bank, the global labor force is 3.62 billion as of 2023, up from 3.55 billion in 2022. The global labor force took a hit because of the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping to 3.43 billion in 2020 from 3.46 billion in 2019. This noticeable fall in global employment recovered within a year, exceeding its pre-pandemic levels in 2021. However, this labor force is unevenly distributed globally, with some countries boasting a larger number of workers than others.\n\nLabor Force in Asia\n\nAccording to data from the World Bank, the total labor force in Asia is in the lead, with 1.27 billion workers in East Asia and the Pacific alone, as of 2023. These numbers are up from 1.26 billion in 2022. According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), labor force participation in the Asia-Pacific region was 63.2% in 2019. Cambodia, Nepal, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had the region's highest labor force participation rates, going above 80%. On the other hand, Papua New Guinea, India, Samoa, Tonga, and Tajikistan had some of the lowest labor force participation rates in the region, all below 50%.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labour Organization, Asia's labor force represents about 59% of the total global labor force. This number is likely to increase as the population of the Asian continent continues to increase.\n\nLabor Force in the European Union\n\nAccording to data by the World Bank, the European Union has a labor force of 219,901,364 people, as of 2023. Germany, France, and Italy take the lead in this region, with a labor force of around 44 million, 31 million, and 25 million people, respectively. The labor force in the region fell to 215,204,661 people in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the numbers recovered in 2021, increasing to 216,664,379 people. 2022 saw a further increase in the EU's labor force, which increased to 219,322,420 people.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother report by Eurostat revealed that men aged 15-24 had an employment rate of 37.0% in 2022, as compared to a 32.3% employment rate for women. Men between the ages of 25-54 had an employment rate of 87.0% in the same year. On the other hand, women in the same age bracket had an employment rate of 76.5%. The gender employment gap, and thus the difference in the labor force based on gender, increased with age in 2022. It went from a 4.7 point difference for the age group of 15-24 years to a 10.5 point difference for the age group 25-54. However, the employment difference was the highest for the age group 55-64 years: 12.5 points. You can also look at 25 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Women in the Workforce.\n\nAccording to the EU Labor Force Survey, the number of workers in the 55-64 age bracket has remained on a positive trajectory despite an overall decrease in the labor force of the region during the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor force in this bracket is also less likely to undergo serious fluctuations in the long term.\n\nNotable Companies with Large Labor Forces\n\nSome of the largest companies in terms of labor force include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TPE:2317).\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported that it has approximately 2.1 million associates in 10,500 stores in 19 countries across the globe as of 2024. The company has 1.6 million associates in the United States alone. On March 12, The New York Times reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) flies a number of its employees to the company's headquarters every few months for the \"Manager Academy.\" This training session focuses on the importance of store managers taking care of workers under them, as well as their customers and the community they serve. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) flew 1,800 store managers to the company's headquarters in 2023. This number is expected to increase in 2024, reaching 2,200.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employs over 1 million individuals, spread across 10,616 retail units across the globe. The company has recentlyintroduced a new smart shopping cart technology called the Amazon Dash Cart at its stores. This technology-infused cart helps customers add, remove, weigh, and adjust items on their total bill. Additionally, they can skip the checkout line entirely and view discounts and deals on shopping items through the cart's technological features. The Amazon Dash Cart is presently only available at certain Amazon Fresh locations.\n\nThe Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TPE:2317) is a multinational Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer with around 1 million employees. The company is known internationally as Foxconn and has manufactured electronics for notable companies across the globe, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), majorly known for assembling the tech giant's products.

        "title": "Love Amazon? This Alternative Stock Might Have Higher Upside.",
        "content": "Tech giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a sensational long-term investment, thanks to the company's apparent disregard for staying in its lane. It went from being an online store for only books to an e-commerce platform for everything. And then it even went beyond e-commerce to develop business operations for shipping logistics, digital advertising, cloud computing, healthcare services, and more.\n\nAnother company with an ever-widening business vision is Singapore's Sea Limited(NYSE: SE). The company has an e-commerce platform and a video game division, and offers financial technology (fintech) services. And it's not content to sit in its core Asian markets. Rather, it aspires to have a growing global operation.\n\nEven though Sea stock is down 85% from its all-time high, I think it's surprisingly a better buy than Amazon stock today. Here's why.\n\nBut first, Amazon is still a great company\n\nDon't misunderstand: Amazon is still a great company. The stock is sitting near an all-time high thanks to its soaring operating profits. Indeed, the chart below shows a strong correlation between Amazon's operating profits and its stock price over the last 20 years. AMZN Chart\n\nOver the last decade, Amazon's operating profits have largely soared because of the success of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services -- AWS supplied 67% of the company's operating income in 2023. But operating profits pulled back in recent years as it invested heavily in logistics to accommodate skyrocketing e-commerce demand.\n\nAmazon's operating profits are now normalizing as investments wind down. Management expects to earn $8 billion to $12 billion in the upcoming first quarter alone. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon stock has more upside.\n\nCompared to Sea stock, Amazon might be a safer bet for making money. That said, Sea stock could have more upside if things go right.\n\nWhy Sea stock is worth buying here\n\nFirst, it's important to note that Sea stock is cheaper than Amazon stock by the price-to-sales (P/S) metric.\n\nStory continues AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nTo value a stock such as Sea at just 2 times sales suggests that investors don't believe the company can grow -- at least not profitably. But I think the company's recent results disprove both opinions.\n\nConsider the chart below that breaks down the financial results for all three of Sea's business segments. Officially, the company calls these segments e-commerce, digital entertainment, and digital financial services. Note that the profit column refers to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nSegment Revenue growth Profit E-commerce 24% ($214) million Digital entertainment (44)% $921 million Digital financial services 44% $550 million\n\nData source: Sea's press release. Chart by author.\n\nOne of Sea's segments has declining revenue, and another has an adjusted EBITDA loss. But as a whole, Sea's revenue was up in 2023, and it was a profitable company. Therefore, the company can grow profitably because it's doing it right now.\n\nTherefore, the question isn't whether this company can grow profitably; the real question is whether it can capture a large opportunity.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the opportunities for Sea. The company does business in growing economies that are digitizing at a fast pace, such as Indonesia, Brazil, India, and more. And with these markets comes the potential for growth.\n\nTake Sea's focus on Brazilian e-commerce, for example. In 2020, the company entered the market. In February, just four short years later, it had already opened its 10th distribution center in the country.\n\nThese Brazilian distribution centers represent significant investment on Sea's part. But as mentioned, it's a big opportunity. Research group Mordor Intelligence estimates that Brazilian e-commerce is a $53 billion market today. But it predicts it will grow at an astonishing 19% compound annual growth rate through 2029. Other research groups similarly predict double-digit growth. And Sea is building the infrastructure to capitalize.\n\nSea is spending heavily on e-commerce. But it's worth noting that its growth is becoming more sustainable. In 2023, the business segment did have an adjusted EBITDA loss of $214 million. But this was almost a $1.5 billion improvement, which shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nIt's not just e-commerce. Sea's financial services division is obviously on fire. It expects a good year for its digital entertainment division as well in 2024, which is fueled by its hit game Free Fire. Management expects a return to double-digit growth this year and could soon relaunch in the massive market of India as it resolves regulatory issues.\n\nWith only $13 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, Sea has ample room for upside given the size of its markets, growth in those markets, and the strong demand for the products and services that it and its competitors offer.\n\nWith closer to $600 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, I'd say the upside potential for Amazon is much lower at this point, which is why Sea is a promising company for investors to consider buying today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sea Limited right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sea Limited wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Growth stocks rocketed in the first quarter as markets priced in Federal Reserve rate cuts. Indeed, based on history, the best growth stocks to buy in April will benefit if the Fed cuts rates.\n\nAccording to Schroders, stocks have had an average return of 11% since 1928, twelve months after the Fed began rate cuts. And, if we are just in the early innings of a bull market, growth stocks could have several years of appreciation.\n\nFurther, the bull case is even stronger based on economic data. First, the unemployment rate is at 3.8%. Secondly, real wage growth has been positive over recent months, which will buoy consumer spending. Thirdly, leading economic indicators have bottomed out and U.S. manufacturing is rebounding.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, this economic and monetary policy backdrop bodes well for these best growth stocks to buy in April. According to Finviz, the following stocks will grow earnings by 30% annually for the next five years. Therefore, expect these stocks to rally further as they outperform expectations going forward.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) A Shake Shack (SHAK) restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSource: JHENG YAO / Shutterstock.com\n\nShake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) has been rallying on good news. First, in February, it reported impressive fourth quarter results that beat expectations. Total revenue was $286.2 million, growing 20% year over year (YOY). Shake Shack sales were up 2.8%, and it opened 41 new restaurants.\n\nAnother reason for the rally was the recent appointment of Rob Lynch as CEO. He has led Papa John’s International (NASDAQ:PZZA) since 2019 and brings in a wealth of experience. His marketing and operational expertise will be valuable in the next phase of Shake Shack’s expansion.\n\nAlso, the restaurant has made significant improvements in profitability. In 2023, restaurant-level operating margins improved by 240 basis points to 19.9%. Management expects more improvements through order customization, tradeups, enhanced labor deployments and supply chain optimization.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, management expects more growth in 2024 through more Shake Shack openings. They estimate 40 licensed openings and 40 domestic company-operated openings. Given these growth catalysts, analysts are bullish. TD Cowen sees upside to $125 driven by margin improvements, minimal leverage and a new CEO.\n\nThus, Shake Shack has a long-term growth runway as it opens more restaurants. With increasing scale, profit margins will expand going forward.\n\nDLocal (DLO) Mobile phone with webpage of Uruguayan payment company dLocal Limited (DLO) on screen in front of logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintechs are disrupting traditional finance and winning in the process. DLocal (NASDAQ:DLO) is an upcoming player that is seeing tremendous success. It supports merchants globally in making and receiving payments efficiently and safely.\n\nGiven its growth trajectory, DLocal is one of the best growth stocks to buy in April. Over the past five years, it has grown total payment volume (TPV) 14-fold to over $17.7 billion. Today, major companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are customers.\n\nIn 2023, its platform served over 600 merchants in 40 countries. TPV was up 67% YOY and revenue was $650 million, representing 55% growth. It is worth noting that most of the growth was from existing merchants as DLocal gained wallet share. Indeed, customers trust the company as exhibited by net revenue retention of 150%.\n\nAlso, management has focused on profitable growth, achieving some of the best metrics among peers. 2023 gross profit grew 37% YOY to $277 million and adjusted EBITDA was $202 million, up 32% YOY.\n\nLooking ahead, DLocal’s prospects are very exciting. Management expects a record total payment volume in 2024, with 40% to 50% growth. They also forecast adjusted EBITDA between US$220 and US$260M, maintaining the focus on profitable growth. DLO stock is a profitable growth story that will roar higher.\n\nNextracker (NXT) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) is a unique way to invest in solar growth without much risk. Unlike solar panels that are heavily commoditized, Nextracker provides proprietary software and controls for large-scale solar projects. Its solar tracker solutions align solar panels with sunlight, enhancing power production.\n\nOn that note, Nextracker is in the midst of a long-term secular growth trend. As utilities retire legacy power generation assets such as coal, renewable sources like solar will fill that gap. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. solar power generation will grow from 163 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2023 to 286 billion kWh next year, representing 75% growth.\n\nThus, customer demand will grow, benefiting Nextracker. According to Mordor Intelligence, the tracker market will expand at a 22.38% compounded annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029. Nextracker is the global leader with over 500 patents and its products have been shipped to over 30 countries.\n\nDue to robust demand, revenue growth accelerated in every quarter last year. In Q2 FY2024 and Q3 FY2024, it was 23% and 38%, respectively. What’s more, it closed Q3 with a record backlog above $3 billion. For FY2024, management expects adjusted diluted EPS between $2.55 and $2.75. NXT stock is among the best growth stocks to buy in April at 20 times FY2024 EPS.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Amazon Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out of Seattle nearly 30 years ago. The innovative company has expanded into multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nAmazon's success has seen its financials flourish, with its annual revenue, operating income, and free cash flow soaring over the past five years. Meanwhile, its market capitalization hit $1.9 trillion in 2024, making it the world's sixth-most-valuable company and comparable to tech giants Alphabet, Nvidia, and Apple.\n\nThe company is on a promising growth path and seems nowhere near to hitting its ceiling as it continues to profit from the tailwinds of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. So, here's why Amazon's stock is a screaming buy right now. AMZN Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nIt's one of the most reliable long-term holds\n\nOne of the best reasons to invest in Amazon is its proven reliability under strain. An economic downturn in 2022 caused a marketwide sell-off, resulting in the Nasdaq Composite plunging 33% during the year. Retailers were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. Shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\n\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business, and its free cash flow has skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising upside over the next two years\n\nAccording to Statista, the e-commerce market is projected to hit $3.6 trillion this year and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% until at least 2028. Amazon's leading 38% market share in online retail therefore looks like the gift that will just keep on giving. The company's role in the industry is paramount, proven by Walmart's second-largest share of just 6%.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue among its three segments.\n\nAWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to develop at a CAGR of 37% until at least 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nSo, it's unsurprising that the cloud company is investing heavily in the budding sector. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-to-physician conversations.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe tech giant is on a promising growth path, and earnings-per-share estimates seem to support its significant potential. The chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44, you get a stock price of $308.\n\nThis projection would see Amazon's stock rise 66% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. The company's shares are a screaming buy right now and worth considering before its share price surges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "\"Big Short\" Investor Michael Burry Has 10% of His Portfolio in 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" AI Stocks",
        "content": "Many people know Michael Burry from the book The Big Short, or the movie that was based on it. Both chronicled the story of a ragtag group of investors who bet against the U.S. housing market before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, shorting mortgage-backed securities at a time when everyone else thought housing was set to go up forever. Burry is still investing today, and runs Scion Asset Management.\n\nIn 2023's fourth quarter, Scion Asset Management reported two purchases that may surprise his value-investing followers: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG). These \"Magnificent Seven\" growth stocks have typically been shunned by value investors due to their high earnings multiples. Yet as of the end of 2023, they made up 10% of Burry's stock portfolio.\n\nSo why did Burry open positions in Amazon and Alphabet?\n\nAmazon: Profits are finally arriving\n\nAt first glance, Amazon seems overvalued. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 62 is more than twice the average of the S&P 500 index (28, as of this writing). However, when you look under the hood, it is clear that Amazon did not show its true profit potential in 2023. Throughout last year, the e-commerce and cloud computing giant expanded its operating margin, leading to approximately 7.5% margins for the last two quarters. That was up significantly from the 2.5% margins it posted in late 2022 and early 2023.\n\nHad Amazon been earning a 7.5% profit margin for the entire year on its total revenue of $575 billion, it would have generated $43 billion in profits in 2023. Against its current market cap of $1.9 trillion, that would have given it a P/E of 44. But even this doesn't tell the full story. Amazon's profit margins should continue to move higher in 2024, for multiple reasons. First, its high-margin cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), continues to shine. Second, it is seeing strong growth from higher-margin e-commerce services such as third-party selling management and advertising. Advertising revenues, for reference, grew by 26% year over year last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Amazon's profit margin reaches 10% in 2024 and its revenue grows by 10% to $630 billion, it will generate $63 billion in earnings this year. That would give it a P/E of 30, or right around the S&P 500's average. Burry likely anticipates that profit inflection happening as well, which would explain why he is buying shares for Scion Asset Management's portfolio. AMZN PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAlphabet: From AI loser to AI winner\n\nBurry's other Magnificent Seven bet, Alphabet, is not optically expensive, but it faced some major negative narratives throughout 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the tech giant traded at a P/E ratio below 15, likely due to investor fears that it was losing the race in AI to upstarts such as OpenAI. Today, it trades at a P/E of 27, which is still slightly below the S&P 500 average, even though the stock is up 77% year to date.\n\nBurry and other investors likely expect Alphabet to maintain its overwhelming share of the search market, which gives it a lucrative digital advertising business. Google Search's market share has remained remarkably steady despite all these new AI competitors, at over 90% according to the latest estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Search revenue grew 12.7% year over year to $48 billion.\n\nAlphabet also has promising businesses in YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube is the dominant player in video streaming worldwide, generating $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter and hitting 100 million premium subscribers. Google Cloud does right around the same in quarterly revenue and is growing sales by 25% year over year.\n\nIf Alphabet maintains its lead in Google Search and keeps growing YouTube and Google Cloud, the stock will likely do well over the long term.\n\nLearn from investing greats, but don't copy them\n\nLooking through the portfolio holdings of famous investors can be insightful. But nobody should be out there blindly buying up every company in Burry's portfolio.\n\nFirst off, we outsiders can't know what Burry's actual theses are on these two stocks. His reasons for holding them may differ from your own, and that could create some discomfort for you if the stocks start falling. Second, the investing public only finds out about hedge funds' moves through their 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are due a month and a half after the end of the quarter they cover, and the most recent ones describe where their portfolios stood at the end of 2023. As such, we can have no idea if Burry has bought or sold Amazon and Alphabet shares in 2024, or if he even has any exposure to the stocks right now. This informational time lag makes trying to copy the moves of famous investors a dangerous idea.\n\nLearn from the investing greats, but don't copy them. It's better to build your portfolio with stocks you believe in, not stocks you believe that others believe in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Top Buffett Stock to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Investing icon Warren Buffett built his legend around decades of market-beating value picks. His strategy has changed in recent years, giving a few high-growth tech stocks a place at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) elite table.\n\nYou might think I'm here to recommend Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio nowadays. Close, but no cigar. I have nothing but respect for the iPhone maker, but its revenue growth has stalled out since 2022, and even Buffett sold 10 million Apple shares last year. The stock still accounts for nearly 42% of Berkshire's stock holdings, but I'm more interested in one of his smaller tech bets.\n\nThat would be Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce retailer and cloud computing pioneer represents just 0.5% of Buffett's stock holdings, and the position is only five years old. However, Buffett is kicking himself for not getting into Amazon earlier -- and it's still one of the most promising tech stocks in today's market.\n\nIf I were starting a long-term portfolio today, Amazon would be one of the first stocks I'd consider. You can buy Amazon shares today, put them under your proverbial pillow, and let them gain value for years or even decades to come.\n\nAmazon's recent roller-coaster ride\n\nThe king of e-commerce in the coronavirus lockdown era lost a step when the inflation crisis started. Amazon's pandemic-inflated sales growth slowed down to a crawl in 2022. At the bottom of that downturn, the company saw $30 billion of negative free cash flow in a single year.\n\nWall Street's reaction was brutal. At the start of 2023, Amazon's stock had fallen 56% from its all-time peak.\n\nI hope you were buying Amazon shares a year ago. As it turns out, the company was busy setting itself up for renewed growth in a healthier economy. Moreover, OpenAI had just kick-started the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy that's expected to power the tech sector for the foreseeable future, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) positioned as a leading platform provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, it wasn't obvious in 2022 that generative AI tools were about to turn the tech sector upside down. The inflation-fighting moves seemed more painful than effective at the time. And Amazon was still burning a ton of cash, adjusting to a weaker retail business and an overly enthusiastic infrastructure expansion during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStill, Amazon always seems to have the right answer for any challenge. Today, its annual free cash flow stands at an all-time high of $32 billion, and year-over-year sales growth has returned to double-digit percentages.\n\nAmazon's stock is also sniffing around record levels again after a two-year retreat. Shares aren't cheap, trading at 64 times trailing earnings and 59 times free cash flow, but I wish I had a dollar for every time people called Amazon \"overvalued\" in its market-stomping three-decade history.\n\nFrom overvalued to invaluable\n\nAlready one of the world's largest and most valuable businesses, Amazon still has a lot of room to continue growing. The AI boom is one active catalyst, along with a vast amount of untapped international opportunity and the fact that old-school brick-and-mortar stores still control 85% of retail activity even in the U.S. market. Amazon's e-commerce muscle can flex much further.\n\nYou shouldn't put all your nest eggs in the Amazon basket, but the stock belongs in any diversified investment portfolio with an eye toward above-average growth prospects. Warren Buffett wishes he had bought Amazon shares earlier, but it's not too late to jump aboard this long-term growth train.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023, and so far this year, its shares are up around 80%.\n\nBut analysts don't expect this sizzling momentum to continue. The consensus price target for Nvidia is barely above its current share price. Here are three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Wall Street thinks will soar more than Nvidia over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a laggard in 2024. It even lost the spot as the biggest company in the world, based on market cap, to Microsoft. However, analysts are more bullish about Apple than any other Magnificent Seven stock right now.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Apple reflects an upside potential of over 9%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April, 32 rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The others recommend holding the stock.\n\nIt might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26.\n\nAnalysts, though, could be anticipating a catalyst with Apple's June developer conference. The company is widely expected to unveil its generative AI strategy at the event.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't delivered Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns. However, the e-commerce and cloud services leader nonetheless pleased investors with a gain of 80% last year and a 20% jump so far this year.\n\nWall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nGenerative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) jumped 58% in 2023. The stock is up over 10% year to date in 2024. Like Apple and Amazon, Alphabet still has more room to run in Wall Street's view.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nAlphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business.\n\nWhy Wall Street could be right\n\nYou can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too.\n\nNvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds.\n\nWall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Hot Stocks: The 3 Best Opportunities for Investing in Web3",
        "content": "Web3 stocks could reshape our digital future, ushering in an era of rapid growth and innovation.\n\nTo put it plainly, the Web3 phenomenon is a paradigm shift, facilitating the creation of an ‘Internet of value.’ It promises a future where digital assets can be seamlessly issued, owned and transferred, effectively revolutionizing digital assets’ ownership, value creation and transfer. With such breakthroughs, money will become more productive, ultimately benefitting the broader economy.\n\nMoreover, despite the short-term concerns, the long-term potential of Web3 stocks is tough to deny. As we venture into this digital frontier, Web3 stocks can potentially drive forward the next wave of internet evolution. That said, here are three Web3 stocks that are leading the charge in the sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) has been dabbling in several emerging technologies, and Web3 is no different. Though not a pure play, its immersive 3D environments and development tools will likely play a critical role in laying the Web3 architecture. Its versatile content creation platform continues to evolve, seamlessly integrating revolutionary new technologies to expand its market share further.\n\nIt added several functionalities last year that aim to effectively weave blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies into its ecosystem. The goal is to empower creators to develop decentralized applications and virtual assets while creating new avenues for gaming experiences.\n\nWeb3 gaming could become massive over time, considering that blockchain-based gaming witnessed a whopping 2000% increase from 2021 to 2022. Unity, in particular, is pushing towards marrying game development with the burgeoning Web3 gaming sphere, potentially adding new chapters to its illustrious growth story.\n\nApplied Digital (APLD) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nApplied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) is another top Web3 stock that powers the infrastructure behind transformative technology. APLD develops and operates data centers that are pivotal in running powerful computer programs, including those needed in crypto mining and blockchain. Its supercharged data centers are energy efficient and facilitate the creation of decentralized apps (dApps), key components of the Web3 vision.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the company is doing well, ending last year with record sales at $55.4 million. Moreover, it maintained momentum in 2024, with back-to-back quarters of spectacular top-line expansion. In its most recent quarter, revenues were up a stunning 243.1% year-over-year (YOY) to $42.2 million, roughly 76% of its full-year sales figure in 2023. As we advance, the company remains incredibly optimistic, projecting the fiscal year 2024 exit with revenue and EBITDA run rates soaring to $500 million and $250 million, respectively.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has its hand in virtually every tech pie, and Web3 is no exception to this trend. It’s poised to play a critical role through its cloud computing behemoth, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nCloud computing provides the muscle needed to run the networks that Web3 relies on, such as blockchain and dApps. Services such as AWS offer the infrastructure and related tools that allow Web3 projects to operate smoothly, securely and at scale. This means that as the sector evolves, AWS stands to benefit tremendously, becoming a backbone of the decentralized web.\n\nMany analysts consider AWS alone a trillion-dollar entity, and its impressive numbers each quarter continue to add more weight to those claims. Amazon ended last year with AWS sales reaching an eye-catching $90.76 billion, up an incredible 13.3% over last year’s $80.10 billion. AWS accounts for about 16% of Amazon’s total sales, which grows steadily each year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Disney",
        "content": "Most investors want a few proven winners in their portfolios, even if they're focused on growth stocks. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Some established industry leaders still have incredible growth prospects, and they come with the added benefit of reliability.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Disney(NYSE: DIS) are both powerhouse leaders that are gaining momentum this year. Which one is the better buy today?\n\nThe case for Amazon: The dominant player in two high-growth businesses\n\nIt's easy to see why Amazon is an amazing stock to own, but the picture becomes even clearer once you dig into the details.\n\nAmazon accounts for almost 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. The No. 2 spot goes to Walmart, which has 6.4%. That's a lead so large it's an impenetrable moat, at least in the near term. Management is making moves to keep it that way and even widen its lead. It's getting more products to more customers faster so shoppers know it's their go-to source for essentials and more. Since e-commerce is growing faster than overall retail, Amazon is well positioned to capture greater market share.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) similarly is the leading provider of cloud solutions for businesses, with 31% of the market according to Statista. Microsoft's Azure is in the No. 2 spot with 24%. It's not the same impenetrable lead as in e-commerce, but it's wide, and Amazon is playing offense to stretch that lead. It's pouring millions into developing generative artificial intelligence (AI) services that could be game changers for its clients, such as tools to create code, images, and full marketing campaigns based on prompts. It also has a strong pipeline of new deals, and management expects that growth will begin to accelerate again sometime in the near future.\n\nOne of Amazon's newer ventures is its advertising business, which accounts for less than 9% of sales but provides a strong growth engine, increasing 27% year over year in the fourth quarter. Like AWS, it's a lean, service-oriented business with high margins, and it's contributing to Amazon's growing operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has a robust streaming business that sits right along the top networks, and it's also making strides in healthcare, where it's just getting its feet wet and learning about the business. Stay tuned for Amazon to launch new healthcare services as it sets out to transform the industry.\n\nThis is only some of what's happening at Amazon today, and there's a lot to look forward to as Amazon continues its journey.\n\nThe case for Disney: All of its parts are working together again\n\nDisney also has multiple parts, but they center around the entertainment industry. Depending on who you ask, Disney is best known for its unparalleled theme parks or industry-dominating films and franchises, but content distribution on linear networks and now streaming are also a big part of its model.\n\nDisney operates 12 global theme parks plus other experiences such as cruises and resorts. Demand is booming for its popular destination parks, and Disney has raised prices several times over the past few years. Parks revenue increased 7% year over year in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 30), and Disney is investing $60 billion in improving and expanding parks to create a broader range of physical experiences for guests.\n\nManagement recently restructured, and all of its media and networks are now reported under a segment called \"entertainment.\" This segment reported a 7% sales decline in the first quarter, mostly due to cord-cutting and pressure in its ad-based networks. But it's making progress in turning Disney+ profitable, and streaming operating loss contracted from $984 million last year to $138 million this year in the first quarter. That's getting close to positive, and CEO Bob Iger reiterated that streaming is expected to become profitable by the end of the year.\n\nDisney has an unbeatable film and content creation system that populates its streaming efforts and consistently accounts for more top box office hits than its competition. Three of the top 10 movies in ticket sales in 2023 were Disney films, and Disney typically releases several sequels or franchise-based films in a given year in addition to developing new characters and franchises. This fuels the cycle of its magic-creation and generates loyalty, fans, sales, and opportunity.\n\nManagement is also working on a deal to turn ESPN into an expanded sports experience. It announced a new streaming service together with Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox to offer a complete network for sports fans and plans to offer other services like e-commerce and betting.\n\nThere's a lot in store for Disney shareholders in 2024 and beyond, and this could be the year that Disney stock finally reaches an all-time high.\n\nTwo amazing stocks to choose from\n\nDisney stock is up 32% this year, and Amazon stock is up 20%. Disney started off the year with more to catch up on than Amazon, which has been soaring over the past year while Disney was still down in the dumps.\n\nBoth of these stocks should continue to reward shareholders this year and in the future. Disney stock is likely to explode when streaming hits profitability and as its business continues to bounce back, but Amazon still has more overall tailwinds. Disney also comes with some added volatility as it needs to choose a CEO to take over for Bob Iger over the next two years. So for today's verdict, I'm going to go with Amazon as the better buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar This Year: My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index has had a great year so far, and we're only a few months into 2024. Technology stocks, which dominate the index, are roaring higher as investors favor growth and innovation such as artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, chip designers, and cloud computing players. This has pushed the index to a record high, confirming that it's reached bull territory.\n\nAnd if history is a guide, the Nasdaq's winning streak may not be over. Over the past six periods of stock market gains dating back to 1990, the Nasdaq has climbed an average of 64% in the first two years of positive performance. The index advanced about 43% last year and so far has climbed 8% this year -- so if it follows historical patterns, the Nasdaq could soar this year. Here are my top AI growth stocks to buy before it does... Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have advanced 20% so far this year, and this top stock could just be getting started. That's because Amazon is an ideal AI stock to buy: The company is using the technology to improve its e-commerce operations, and it's also selling AI products and services to cloud computing services customers through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit. So, it's benefiting from AI in two ways.\n\nFor example, Amazon uses AI to help it streamline fulfillment center operations and select the shortest delivery routes. This is key because it could reduce the company's cost to serve.\n\nAnd AWS has made addressing every level of AI needs a priority, so it offers customers the basics like chips for their training and inference programs as well as a fully managed service that allows them to customize top large language models (LLMs) for their own use. Considering AWS is the world's leading cloud services player, it already has an enormous audience present -- and ready to launch AI projects.\n\nSo, it's clear AI could have a significant impact on Amazon's earnings growth over time through streamlining e-commerce processes and reducing costs there, and by boosting AWS revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for 43 times forward earnings estimates, which looks like a reasonable price for a growth stock -- especially one with a solid profitability picture and a compelling AI strategy.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has struggled to keep up in the AI race, but the tide recently may have turned. The chip company late last year introduced a portfolio of AI products that could up its game and drive a new era of growth. An example is the Intel Core Ultra mobile processor family, a key step to kick off the age of the AI personal computer -- these are high-power computers that can carry out many AI tasks.\n\nIntel also announced its latest Intel Xeon processor family with AI acceleration and its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. I wouldn't expect these innovations to threaten chip market giant Nvidia's leadership, but that's OK. Considering the opportunity -- with the AI market forecast to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- there's room for more than one company to carve out market share and benefit. Intel could be one of them thanks to its new and upcoming innovations.\n\nOn top of this, Intel's move to open its manufacturing network up to others, with the goal to become the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030, could supercharge growth. It's a big bet, but one that could bring major rewards down the road. Intel already has won commitments from four customers for its 18A process and signed five advanced packaging deals.\n\nIntel shares trade for 29 times forward earnings estimates, a bargain considering the company's AI and foundry prospects as well as analyst estimates for double-digit annual growth over the next five years. So Intel could be ripe for a rebound, making now an ideal time to get in on this technology giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Revenue: $170 billion, up 13% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange impact. Operating Income: $13.2 billion, up 383% year-over-year. Free Cash Flow: $35.5 billion trailing 12-month, up $48.3 billion year-over-year. Advertising Growth: Up 26% year-over-year, driven by sponsored ads. AWS Revenue Growth: Up 13% year-over-year in Q4, nearing $100 billion annualized run rate. Cost to Serve: Decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018. Prime Member Delivery: Over 7 billion items delivered same or next day. Third-Party Seller Services Revenue: Grew 19% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange impact. Third-Party Seller Unit Mix: Reached highest level ever at 61%. North America Revenue: $105.5 billion, up 13% year-over-year. International Revenue: $40.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange impact. AWS Operating Income: $7.2 billion, up $2 billion year-over-year. CapEx: $48.4 billion for the full year, down $10.2 billion year-over-year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nRelease Date: February 01, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nRevenue of $170 billion, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income of $13.2 billion, up 383% year-over-year or $10.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year. Advertising growth remained strong, up 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by sponsored ads. AWS revenue grew 13% year-over-year in Q4, approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion.\n\nNegative Points\n\nThe results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and changes in global economic conditions. Guidance incorporates order trends to date and assumptions which may not accurately predict demand for goods and services. The cost to serve has been reduced for the first time since 2018, indicating previous years of increased costs. International segment reported an operating loss of $419 million, despite an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. CapEx is expected to increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of AWS.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024? A: AWS revenue growth accelerated to 13.2% in Q4, with an expectation of accelerating trends into 2024. Cost optimization has largely occurred, migrations have picked up, and larger new deals have accelerated. Interest in generative AI products like Bedrock and Q is also contributing to growth. CapEx will increase in 2024, primarily driven by infrastructure CapEx to support AWS growth, including investments in generative AI and large language models.\n\nQ: How are you going to market within the application layer of the generative AI stack, and could you expand on the strategy for gen AI on the consumer-facing side of the business? A: Customers want choice and the ability to experiment with different models for different applications. AWS's Bedrock is resonating with customers for its ability to manage transitions and changes in generative AI applications. The coding companion, Q, is also gaining interest for its productivity benefits. On the consumer side, Amazon is building dozens of generative AI applications across the company, including the newly launched Rufus, a shopping assistant. These applications are expected to improve conversion rates and overall consumer engagement on retail apps.\n\nQ: Can you walk us through some of the key operational blocking-and-tackling that is to happen to continue to drive down the cost to serve back to 2018 levels or however you're thinking about your north star from that perspective? A: Amazon is focused on improving cost to serve by honing regionalization improvements, reevaluating the fulfillment network, and focusing on inbound processes and inventory placement. These efforts are expected to lower costs while delivering faster for customers. The company does not see 2018 as the north star for cost to serve but believes there is meaningful upside for further improvements.\n\nQ: How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases or some type of capital return programs to help shareholders out? A: Amazon is pleased with the improvement in free cash flow and debates and discusses capital structure policies regularly. While there is nothing to announce currently, the company has strong investments ahead and is glad to have better liquidity at the end of 2023, aiming to continue building it.\n\nQ: Can you talk about some of the levers in moving into positive operating income for International and how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? A: Amazon has seen improvement in International profitability, driven by cost to serve reductions, advertising strength, cost attention, and wise investments. The company is focused on customer inputs and improving efficiencies within operations. In established countries like the U.K., Germany, and Japan, strong revenue growth contributed to profitability, while emerging countries are on a trajectory toward breakeven and income contribution.\n\nQ: Can you provide any color or context on expectations around Amazon Prime Video ads? A: Advertisers are excited to access Amazon's Prime customer base, and the company is looking to increase advertising in streaming properties, including Fire TV and Prime Video. The ads are expected to be an important part of the business model, allowing continued investment in content and growth. Amazon anticipates the ads will not have heavy loads and will be useful for customers.\n\nQ: Can you talk a bit about the progress in unifying the grocery offering between dot com Fresh and Whole Foods and the opportunity in reverse logistics? A: Amazon is making progress in unifying the grocery offering, with a focus on improving the customer experience and leveraging logistics capabilities. The company is working on making it easier for customers to shop between nonperishables and Whole Foods and Fresh selections, with the potential to lower costs and increase traffic and revenue in the grocery business.\n\nQ: Could you talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in health care? A: Amazon sees an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing the health care experience, particularly in primary care and pharmacy. The company's vision includes improving the customer experience through services like Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical, which offer convenient access to medications and primary care. Amazon believes that integrating health care services with its retail offerings can lead to a better customer experience and potentially expand into wellness and diet-related services.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has risen nearly 80% over the past 12 months. The e-commerce and cloud leader grappled with a post-pandemic slowdown and tough macro headwinds in 2022, but its core businesses have been stabilizing.\n\nAmazon still remains a few dollars below its record high of $186.12 set on July 8, 2021. But could it rally even more and set new all-time highs over the next 12 months? Image source: Amazon.\n\nWhat happened to Amazon over the past year?\n\nIn 2020, Amazon's revenue surged 38% after the pandemic drove more people to shop online and more businesses upgraded their cloud-based services. Its sales rose another 22% in 2021.\n\nBut in 2022, its revenue only increased 9% as the pandemic waned, inflation curbed consumer spending, and companies reined in their cloud spending to cope with higher interest rates and other macro headwinds.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon's sales climbed 12% after its North American, international, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) businesses rebounded. That acceleration suggested the company had finally passed its cyclical trough and was primed to grow again.\n\nMetric Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 North America sales growth (YOY) 13% 11% 11% 11% 13% International sales growth (YOY) (8%) 1% 10% 16% 17% AWS sales growth (YOY) 20% 16% 12% 12% 13% Total sales growth (YOY) 9% 9% 11% 13% 14%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = year over year.\n\nAmazon's recovery in North America was driven by faster delivery speeds, more orders for everyday essentials, and the expansion of its advertising business. Its overseas growth was fueled by its move into more emerging markets.\n\nAWS benefited from increased cloud infrastructure upgrades to support bigger workloads and new generative AI applications. That stabilization and acceleration in the second half of 2023 was a bright spot, because Amazon usually leverages AWS' higher-margin cloud revenue to subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin retail businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts profit growth is stable... if we ignore Rivian\n\nAmazon's revenue growth is stabilizing, but its profit growth is lumpier. Its earnings per share (EPS) jumped 82% in 2020 and 55% in 2021, but it reported a loss in 2022 as its investment in the struggling EV maker Rivian withered. It returned to profitability in 2023, but its EPS was still 11% lower than 2021's result.\n\nSo to get a clearer view of Amazon's profitability, we should exclude its underwater investment in Rivian and focus on its operating margin, which expanded from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.4% in 2023 after it cut costs and laid off thousands of workers.\n\nRivian, which is still obligated to deliver 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon by the end of the decade, could remain a deadweight on its net income growth for the foreseeable future. But Rivian's production rates are stabilizing, it's gradually narrowing its losses, and it looks dirt cheap at 2 times this year's sales. All of those factors could limit its downside potential and prevent it from causing another annual net loss for Amazon.\n\nIs Amazon ready to fire on all cylinders again?\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Amazon's revenue and EPS to rise 12% and 42%, respectively, as its e-commerce and cloud businesses stabilize. However, its e-commerce marketplaces still face stiff competition from newcomers like PDD Holdings' Temu and Shein, while Microsoft's Azure is becoming a major threat to AWS in the cloud infrastructure and AI race. Amazon needs to move quickly to neutralize those threats.\n\nIn 2025, analysts expect Amazon's revenue and EPS to grow 12% and 26%, respectively. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they imply that the worst is over and that it can overcome its macro and competitive headwinds. Based on those expectations, Amazon's stock trades at 43 times forward earnings.\n\nThat multiple might seem high, but it also trades at just 3 times this year's sales. That's a reasonable price-to-sales ratio for an e-commerce leader; eBay and Etsy shares also fetch about 3 times this year's sales. So over the next 12 months, I believe Amazon's stock continue to outperform the S&P 500 as investors recognize it as one of the simplest ways to profit from the secular growth of the e-commerce, cloud, digital advertising, and AI markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article5 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nYet another stronger-than-expected jobs report published on Friday is further dampening investors’ hopes of seeing the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June. Analysts have started to predict that the Federal Reserve might further delay its first rate cut to avoid seeing a strong rebound in inflation down the road. Piper Sandler said in its fresh note that latest data is showing the US labor market is “even stronger than we thought and maybe getting stronger.” Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, also said in a note that investors are beginning to digest the possibility of not seeing three rate cuts this year. He thinks the Fed could cut rates twice this year, but it’s still early to say anything.\n\nPossibility of No Rate Cuts in 2024?\n\nMoving expectations from three rate cuts to two won’t be a big deal for the market, given the resilience of the labor market, strong household savings and the AI revolution that keeps pushing stocks higher. But what if the Fed kills the possibility of any rate cuts this year because of sticky inflation and strong hiring? A few months ago this would have sounded like an impossible thing to say. Today, it’s totally a possibility.\n\n\"If the economy is running the way it's running now through most of this year, then it might be likely that the Fed does not cut interest rates this year,” Saglimbene added.\n\nCan Smaller Companies Benefit from the AI Rally? Taking Guidance from History\n\nDespite this backdrop, more and more market experts have been saying that the AI-led rally that boosted large-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and many others, is starting to broaden out to smaller companies. They say for long-term investors it’s time to pile into small-cap stocks in the technology sector. Hartford Funds in a report last month said that historically, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks but this trend averages out and reverses after ten years. The report noted that small-cap companies have been trading at low forward P/E ratios when compared to their large-cap counterparts for years, and if we use history as our guide, a “switch to small-cap outperformance is due.”\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in High-Quality Small-Cap Stocks\n\nThe last thing any sane investor would want in this uncertain environment is volatility and turbulence. So why would it make sense to invest in penny stocks or small companies? After all small-cap stocks have become synonymous with volatility. Small-cap proponents say that not all small-cap stocks are equal. For long-term investors who want to make money investing, opportunities lie in the small-cap universe. A GMO report published in 2022 talked about the importance of investing high quality small-cap stocks. What are high quality small-cap stocks? According to GMO, which said it has been investing small-cap quality stocks since 2004 as part of its “Quality Strategy”, high quality companies have “high margins, high returns on capital, low debt, and stable fundamentals.” This is what the firm found out about high quality small-cap companies:\n\n“High-quality small cap companies have delivered stronger returns than the small cap universe, with lower volatility. Since 1976, small cap quality has outperformed the small cap asset class in the U.S. by 1.8% annualized and has also outperformed the all-cap U.S. market by 2.8% annualized. These more predictable, long-term winners are very often undervalued by the market, buried under the buzz of stocks long on narrative but short on fundamental stability.”\n\nPerformance of Small Companies So Far in 2024\n\nBut how have small-cap and micro-cap stocks been performing this year? Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT), which invests in small-cap technology stocks, is up just 5.80% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500’s return of 27%. So far this year, the ETF is down 3.56%. But artificial intelligence is doing its wonders in the small-cap space too, since smaller names like Super Micro and MicroStrategy, part of the small-cap focused Russell 2000, poste huge returns on the back of the AI wave. A recent Wall Street Journal report said, citing data from LSEG, that these two companies collectively accounted for about a third of the Russell 2000’s 5.2% return in the first quarter.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, it would be interesting to see which smaller tech companies hedge funds are investing in. In this article we first scanned Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds and their holdings and picked 11 penny technology stocks (trading under $5) with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now\n\n11. Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nMobile advertising and app growth solutions company Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) ranks 11th in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in now according to hedge funds.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds had stakes in Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS). The biggest stakeholder of Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) during this period was D. E. Shaw which owns a $13 million stake in Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS).\n\n10. Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nVirginia-based IT and cybersecurity company Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) ranks 10th in our list of the best technology penny stocks hedge funds are piling into. Earlier this month Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.09, beating estimates by $0.02.

        "title": "Why \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Meta and Amazon Rallied Today, While Tesla Stock Tapped the Brakes",
        "content": "Since the beginning of last year, the group of stocks collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has helped push the market higher. The combination of industry-leading positions and connections to artificial intelligence (AI) has made this group of high-profile stocks a must-have for many investors. However, since the beginning of 2024, there's been a divergence, and while some members continue to pull their weight, others have fallen short.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) climbed 3.1%, e-commerce and cloud pioneer Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) rose 3.1%, and electric vehicle (EV) specialist Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) tumbled 1.9%, as of 1:45 p.m. ET. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBusiness-based drivers\n\nMeta Platforms investors were optimistic today after the social media company responded to allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it violated a 2020 privacy agreement. The settlement banned the company from profiting from data related to minors.\n\nThe FTC sought to amend the accord, but Meta pushed back, saying it \"voluntarily disclosed the technical errors\" detected in its Messenger Kids app. The FTC is looking to impose additional restrictions on Meta, which could ultimately be more costly. Investors welcomed the company's response to regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of things appear to be moving Amazon stock. Reports have emerged that the company is cutting a number of jobs in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment as it seeks to rein in costs. The company is reportedly eliminating hundreds of positions, including those in marketing, sales, and global services.\n\nFurthermore, in an overhaul of its Amazon Fresh stores, the company announced it is eliminating its \"Just Walk Out\" technology from stores in the U.S., replacing the costly systems with smart shopping carts. This move will also likely save Amazon money over the long term, and investors applauded the cost-saving measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are also a couple of reports that are driving Tesla. Unfortunately for investors, the stock is headed in the other direction. In the wake of what some market watchers called a \"nightmare quarter\" for Tesla, there are reports the company is slashing prices on the Model Y -- its most popular vehicle -- by as much as $7,000 in the U.S.\n\nThe move is designed to clear out the company's massive backlog of inventory, as Tesla reported manufacturing 46,000 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter. This will likely have a negative impact on Tesla's bottom line for the current quarter.\n\nAdditionally, according to a report by Reuters, Tesla has decided to scrap plans to build a lower-priced model. The project has been on the drawing board for years, and a less-costly model was seen as a way to appeal to a broader cross-section of the car market. If Tesla were to abandon this long-term goal, this could impact how investors view the company's future prospects.\n\nIt's worth noting that CEO Elon Musk reportedly refuted the claims on social media.\n\nA parting of the ways?\n\nIt seemed the Magnificent Seven could do no wrong last year, with the group often moving higher in unison. Eventually, however, investors will demand performance from even the most viral businesses, and that appears to be happening thus far in 2024. Meta and Amazon, along with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are all outpacing the S&P 500 this year, while Tesla and Apple -- which have both faced headwinds -- are lagging the broader market.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Meta is the cheapest of our trio of stocks, selling for just 26 times forward earnings, compared to multiples of 44 and 59 for Amazon and Tesla, respectively.\n\nTo be clear, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks has the potential to lead the market higher again, but investors will require strong business and financial performance before fueling further gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.36 billion and $715.6 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold Nvidia and Alphabet Shares Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. Here Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers.\n\nHe correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest.\n\nIt raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA changing of the guard\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.\n\nThe sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million.\n\nIn this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead\n\nIn moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.\n\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.\n\nThe company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.\n\nAnd with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.\n\nA timely investing lesson\n\nSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.\n\nThere's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.\n\nInfluential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "It’s less stressful to buy reliable companies and hold onto them for many years than it is to trade stocks and strategically plan your entries and exits. Even the most reliable companies go through down cycles and you will have to remain patient during those stretches. This reality has led to the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nWhile every stock goes through ups and downs, reliable long-term growth stocks continue to gain instead of puttering out after a big rally. Long-term stocks exhibit competitive moats and expand their profit margins. These corporations have multiple years of sustainable growth and catalysts that still look strong.\n\nInvestors looking for some long-term stock ideas may want to consider the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) Graphic of green and blue arrow against pale green background pointing up and to the right, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ex_artist\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage company that offers healthier alternatives than many of its competitors. The company’s drinks have been flying off the shelves. Revenue increased by 95% year-over-year to $347 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income came to $39.1 million compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nThose growth rates are impressive, but those results have been regular. Investors have noticed and have bid up the stock by 5,500% over the past five years. The stock has double-digit net profit margins and has a compelling growth opportunity that can result in more gains.\n\nCelsius Holdings is expanding internationally. Almost all of its sales currently come from North America. It’s still in the very early innings of its international expansion and recently got into Australia and New Zealand. The company will launch its beverages in those regions in Q4 2024.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates in multiple business verticals. Its two largest segments are e-commerce and cloud computing, but it’s also gaining market share in advertising, video streaming, and groceries. The Magnificent Seven stock is expanding its net profit margins and currently comes with a $1.9 trillion market cap. The stock is up by 76% over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech conglomerate once again posted strong financials. Revenue increased by 14% year-over-year to reach a record-breaking $170.0 billion. The online marketplace achieved double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets. Amazon Web Services grew by 13% year-over-year. Net income reached $10.6 billion in the quarter. This make it one of the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nAmazon continues to invest in its product delivery network to ensure a lengthy lead over its competitors. Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and has effectively used its capital to explore other ventures. Amazon’s latest opportunity is artificial intelligence which it has incorporated into Amazon Web Services.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) Hand pointing upward next to upward trend stock chart in purple and blackish blue lighting, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an edtech company that helps people learn new languages and skills. The app recently began to offer educational resources for math, music, and additional subjects that stretch beyond learning new languages.\n\nThe green bird has been producing positive returns for investors. Shares are up by 49% over the past year. The stock’s only weakness is its 130-forward P/E ratio. The most compelling growth stocks often have high valuations, but investors have a few reasons to believe that Duolingo can grow into its valuation.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year in Q4 2023 amid a 65% year-over-year increase in the number of daily active users. The company’s $12.1 million in net income was a big development as the firm had recently been unprofitable.\n\nDuolingo’s scaling efforts can translate into profit margin expansions that will make the stock look more attractive for long-term investors. The firm has the potential to be a great long-term stock and will look more enticing after a pullback. It’s one of the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH and AMZN.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 most Buddhist countries in Asia. If you would like to skip our discussion on the global influence of Buddhism, you can go to the 5 Most Buddhist Countries in Asia.\n\nBuddhism is the fourth-largest religion in the world, with over 500 million followers as of 2020. Buddhists make up almost 7% of the world’s population, and almost half of the world's population of Buddhists live in China. Despite having the largest population of Buddhists in the world, only 18% of China’s population identify as Buddhists. The remaining Buddhists live primarily in Asia.\n\nThere are many Buddhist-majority countries in Asia, including Bhutan, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. However, there are only four countries in the world where the official religion is Buddhism. These are Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. Despite originating from Nepal and India, Buddhism is not a commonly practiced religion in either country. According to the Pew Research Center, only 1% of Indians and 10% of Nepalese are Buddhists.\n\nIt is interesting to note that only 1.4% of the world’s Buddhist population lives outside Asia. Buddhists are heavily concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, with 98.7% of the world’s Buddhist population in the region. Meanwhile, 1.2% of American adults identify as Buddhists, and amongst those, two-thirds are Asian-American. Around 1% of Canadians also identify as Buddhists. However, despite these low Buddhist populations, North America is being significantly influenced by the Buddhist philosophy, leading to numerous meditation centers, temples, and cultural practices of Zen across the region.\n\nAccording to the projections by the Pew Research Center, the United States will be amongst the top 10 countries with the largest Buddhist population by 2050. This would be a significant change as the list has previously been dominated entirely by Asian countries. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to see a decline in the number of Buddhists, while other regions such as the Middle East-North Africa, North America, and Europe are expected to see growth in the total Buddhist populations. Despite the increase in Buddhist populations across various regions, Buddhists are expected to make up only 5% of the global population in 2060.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike the other major religions in the world, Buddhism is considered a philosophy and a lifestyle by a majority of Buddhists. It plays multiple roles in people’s lives. Many Buddhists also believe that it is a culture and ethnicity that one is born into. While many Asians follow Buddhist customs and practices, they may not consider themselves followers of Buddhism as a religion. The symbol of Buddhism is the Dharmachakra (Wheel of the Law). The Dharma Wheel is a symbol of Gautama Buddha himself. It has eight spokes, each one representing one of Buddha's Eightfold Path milestones.\n\nIntegration of Buddhist Practices in Corporate Culture\n\nPublic companies and organizations such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been increasingly incorporating Buddhist practices and principles into their operations, often to enhance employee well-being, productivity, and corporate culture. A study published in the Kelaniya Journal of Management shared that utilizing Buddhist principles and methods in organizational management can prove highly beneficial, given their broad applicability and potential to enhance productivity within the organization.\n\nOne notable example is Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AmaZen program, which incorporates yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practices to improve employee mental well-being and productivity. Many corporations have been adopting Buddhist practices to help manage workplace stress and enhance employee satisfaction. However, some have criticized this approach, arguing that it could be seen as an attempt to co-opt Buddhism for corporate gain.\n\nSimilarly, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), has been recognized for integrating principles of Servant Leadership and Buddhist values into his leadership approach. This integration has led to significant cultural and strategic shifts within Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), fostering an environment that prioritizes employee well-being, ethical practices, and a sense of community. Furthermore, Marc Benioff of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another leader who has successfully integrated Buddhist principles into his leadership style, leading to positive organizational changes. In addition to personally engaging in \"mindfulness\" sessions several times per week, he also incorporated meditation rooms into some of Salesforce’s (NYSE:CRM) newly constructed office spaces, aiming to promote this practice among his employees. 20 Most Buddhist Countries in Asia\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 most Buddhist countries in Asia, we consulted renowned sources such as the Pew Research Center and Data Pandas.

        "content": "Dividends offer income and increase your total return on stocks. And, this income will grow with the best dividend growth stocks to buy in April.\n\nWhen choosing, consider two critical factors. First, candidates must be in stable industries that guarantee earnings growth in any economic environment. While some cyclical companies might pay high yields currently, these dividends are prone to cuts when earnings fall during a downturn.\n\nSecondly, the following three companies already have a strong dividend record. For starters, their forward dividend yield is above 2% and each has recorded over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. Even better, they have grown their dividends by more than 10% annually over the last five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven their stellar dividend growth, these stocks are a great source of portfolio income. You can buy them today below the 21 times earnings in which the market is trading.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis regulated utility with a growing renewable energy business has a 3.25% forward dividend yield. Additionally, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years.\n\nAlso, the utility has achieved a 10.8% five-year dividend growth rate and this record is likely to continue. First, it owns Florida Power & Light Company, the largest electric utility in the U.S. As a regulated utility with a monopoly position in Florida, it charges prices that allow a good earnings return on capital.\n\nSecondly, it’s the largest producer of renewable energy from solar and wind through NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra has some of the best sites for renewable power generation on its portfolio. Moreover, it has entered into purchase power agreements with terms exceeding 20 years. These contracts include escalator clauses that guarantee the renewable business will earn good returns.\n\nGiven the stability of its regulated utility business in Florida and the growth from the renewable business, NextEra presents as one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy. With a payout ratio below 60%, ample room for future dividend growth exists.\n\nStory continues\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ) A zoomed in image of one Oreo cookie leaning on another Oreo cookie with cookie crumbles in front and a white background.\n\nSource: DenisMArt / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnacking is a favorite pastime for many people, regardless of their financial situation. That’s why Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) continues to be a stable revenue grower. At 20 times forward earnings and a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, it’s a no-brainer buy.\n\nMondelez is a huge international player, with 70% of its sales from outside the U.S. Notably, the snack company has some of the most popular brands and garners significant shelf space in retail stores.\n\nIndeed, its dominant position is undisputed. According to management, it has a 17% market share in biscuits and a 13% share in confectionery. Its leading brands have supported steady demand growth and market share gains. As a result, over the last 5 years, revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.7%.\n\nImpressively, the company has achieved volume growth while raising prices. This highlights consumers’ affinity for its top brands, such as Oreo and Cadbury. Also, Mondelez has achieved impressive profits, with operating margins exceeding 15% in the last five years.\n\nAs of this writing, Mondelez International has a 48% payout ratio. Management expects 3%- 5% organic sales growth in fiscal year 2024. Moreover, they forecast adjusted EPS to grow at a high single-digit rate, meaning the 10-year dividend growth record will be extended.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) is one of the retailers that has managed to fight off competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and grow. By creating a fulfilling in-store experience and a broad assortment of essentials, home goods and apparel, it maintains customer interest. At the same time, it has built its omnichannel fulfillment capabilities to cater to the online shopper.\n\nIndeed, Target has established itself as one of the leading retailers in the U.S. Although fiscal year 2023 sales declined 1.6%, they were still 37% above fiscal year 2019 levels.\n\nEven more impressive is Target’s dividend record. The retailer is a dividend aristocrat that has grown its dividend for 55 consecutive years. As earnings have grown, it has upped its dividend growth, increasing the dividend by 11.5% annually over the last five years. As of this writing, it yields 2.47% and has a low payout ratio of 48.8%.\n\nFundamentally, the stock is also attractive at current levels. It has resolved most of the shrink and inventory issues it experienced over the past two years. Fiscal year 2023 GAAP EPS of $8.94 rose significantly from $5.98 in fiscal year 2022. And management expects even more improvements in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — For years, Amazon.com Inc. has been the stingiest among tech megacaps to give back capital to shareholders. Now, it’s generating so much cash that some on Wall Street are anticipating more generous returns.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car Fizzles Kim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios Texas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 Billion TSMC Facilities to Resume Production Overnight After Quake A Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead\n\nAfter a record haul of $32 billion in free cash flow last year, Amazon is projected to nearly double that in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With Big Tech acquisitions increasingly facing regulatory opposition, Amazon has fewer options on how it chooses to deploy that cash, according to Robert Schiffman, a senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“This suggests not only rising share buybacks, but a more aggressive capital return policy that could include a dividend,” said Schiffman. “If returns don’t increase, cash balances could soar above $100 billion later this year.”\n\nAmazon had more than $86 billion in cash at the end of 2023.\n\nFor most of its three decades in existence, Amazon has opted to plow its cash back into the business. The last buyback was for $10 billion in 2022, which is a pittance compared with similar sized peers.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet Inc. repurchased more than $60 billion in shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. spent more than $20 billion on buybacks in the same period and in February pledged an additional $50 billion, while initiating its first-ever quarterly dividend.\n\nAmazon, by contrast, didn’t buy back any shares in 2023. A change in its capital-return policy would signal a shift as the company evolves under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took the reins from co-founder Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon shares have managed to outperform even in the absence of big buybacks. The stock has climbed 20% this year, pushing its market value to $1.9 trillion as analysts continue to hike profit estimates and traders grow increasingly optimistic about artificial intelligence helping to reinvigorate growth at Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has gained 8% over the same period.\n\nStill, while Amazon is on the cusp of setting a new all-time high, it’s alone among the five biggest US tech companies that isn’t yet in record territory. Microsoft Corp., for example, is trading about 20% above its 2021 record, while Meta is up more than 30% from its previous peak in the same year.\n\nNaveen Jayasundaram, senior research analyst at ClearBridge Investments, expects Amazon to announce a buyback in the tens of billions of dollars sometime this year, but sees a dividend as unlikely.\n\n“I think Amazon views itself as being earlier in the growth cycle compared with Alphabet and Meta, so I would be surprised if we got a dividend this year,” said Jayasundraram. “However, it does seem like something that could come in the next four to five years.”\n\nAmazon is expected to report first-quarter earnings later this month. Even though the company is still cutting costs, it has plenty to spend on. Amazon plans to pour almost $150 billion in the coming 15 years on data centers to handle an anticipated explosion in demand for digital services related to AI.\n\nThat type of spending is critical to Amazon defending its turf from competitors and should take precedence over capital returns, according to Cyrus Amini, chief investment officer at Helium Advisors.\n\n“I wouldn’t be disappointed if it did a buyback, but I would be surprised,” he said. “Amazon is still growing, and it needs to keep spending to protect its moat.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, which is made up of 30 chip companies, has rallied nearly 60% over the past 12 months. The chip benchmark, also known as SOX, has been boosted by strong showings from AI beneficiaries including Nvidia Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., helping it outperform the S&P 500 Index.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc. has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, a field with the potential to become one of the company’s ever-shifting “next big things,” according to people familiar with the situation. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the automaker has been boosting pay for artificial intelligence engineers as it faces a war over talent. After several grueling months waging a costly, $40 million campaign to win over investors, battling opponents in the press, settling a thorny political spat in Florida and unfurling a series of initiatives, Bob Iger has finally defeated billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz. SK Hynix Inc. plans to spend $3.87 billion building an advanced packaging plant and research center for artificial intelligence products in Indiana, marking a win for the Biden administration as it seeks to increase semiconductor output on American soil. Taiwan’s semiconductor industry restarted operations and emergency personnel worked to help injured and trapped citizens as the island begins to recover from its worst earthquake in 25 years.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n—With assistance from Matt Day and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future How Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Canada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil EV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China’s Car King\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring.\n\nWith digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\n\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\n\nHerbalife Ltd is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased the competitiveness in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon’s entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially.\n\nIn North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials.\n\nThe industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy’s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon’s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market.\n\nIn October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately, accelerate customer service and ensure the right quantities of medications in stock.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market. With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon’s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in recent times in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments.\n\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%) and text messages (29%). The companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, placing it in the bottom 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 29.7%. The S&P 500 Composite has risen 28.4% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.50X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.38X and the sector’s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X.\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus and 1 to Avoid\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. The company is investing in emerging technology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for its constituents. CVS Health’s solid digital engagement and enhanced capabilities should strengthen its ability to drive seasonal flu and RFD immunization awareness and connect patients to the CVS locations for these important health services.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a 3.6% rise from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 9.1%.

The company’s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach. At present, Walgreens Boots 11 micro-fulfilment centers currently support 4,600 stores.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.4% from the 2023 reported figure. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently experiencing a decline in sales. Herbalife's direct-selling business model and product range, which includes weight management and nutrition products, are facing challenges amid a complex economic environment.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a plunge of 18.5% from the 2023 reported figure. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is -4%. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Amazon has said it is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AWS cloud computing unit as part of a strategic shift.\n\nThe company aid it is axing “a few hundred roles” in the team that oversees technology used in its physical stores, and follows the announcement that it is ending its use of its self-service checkout “just walk out” tech in grocery stores in the US.\n\nThe tech giant said it is also cutting several hundred roles in the sales, marketing and global service teams at AWS.\n\n“These decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” AWS said in a statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt added that it will continue to hire in other, priority areas and that it has thousands of AWS job openings posted online.\n\nThe company has not said in which countries the layoffs will take place, but said it will also try to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are affected.\n\nLee Sustar, principal analyst at research and advisory firm Forrester, said changing economic factors post-pandemic and the rise of artificial intelligence are likely factors in Amazon’s decision.\n\n“AWS has been adapting to customers’ cost-cutting efforts following the spike in cloud IT spending during the pandemic, assisting them in that process,” he said.\n\n“The resulting moderation of demand is a factor in these layoffs as well as enterprise cloud spending on AI flowing to Microsoft Azure, challengers like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and new AI-focused cloud companies.”\n\nThe cuts follow previous layoffs announced in January across Amazon’s Prime Video and MGM Studios unit, with streaming service Twitch, also owned by Amazon, cutting more than 500 jobs in the same month to save on costs.\n\nIt continued an ongoing trend of job cuts in the tech sector over the last 18 months, with thousands of layoffs across many of the industry’s biggest firms.",

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks are companies that have been performing at a consistently high levels for a very long time. Most investors consider these to be some of the safest investments you can make. These companies are usually industry leaders that have a long history of growth and stability. Adding a foundation of strong, blue-chip stocks can be a great way to diversify and build your portfolio for the long term.\n\nOften, blue-chip stocks can be considered boring and vanilla. Nonetheless, we see certain blue-chip picks as opportunities for excellent growth for shareholders, and in some cases, a generous annual dividend. In this article, we will set our eyes on three undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy into April as the second quarter kicks off.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American multinational eCommerce and technology company. As of April 2024, it is the sixth-largest company in the world by market cap and is considered one of the Magnificient 7 stocks. Despite already gaining 20% in 2024, its average one-year price target still gives almost 10% more to grow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter ending March at an all-time high monthly closing price, Amazon is well positioned to climb back to all-time high prices later this year. Like its big tech peers, Amazon is making major bets on the AI industry. This includes everything from integration into its marketplace to improve user experience to leveraging its industry-leading AWS for developers. Amazon has also made multi-billion dollar investments into OpenAI competitor Anthropic which has a ChatGPT rival called Claude AI.\n\nIs Amazon undervalued? Shares currently trade at just 3.2x sales, nearly half of that of Alphabet and a fraction of Microsoft, Tesla, and NVIDIA. With a 5-year revenue CAGR of 20%, Amazon’s price certainly has more room to grow.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screen\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an American content streaming service that is available by subscription in over 190 countries around the world. This blue-chip stock currently trades at a slight premium to its average analyst price target.\n\nFor the first time in years, the company has the platform firing on all cylinders. Back in 2022, Netflix started a cheaper subscription price that comes with viewable ads. Last year, Netflix finally cracked down on password sharing. Not only has the platform seen a boost in subscribers, but Netflix has also been able to raise the monthly cost for both basic and premium subscribers. The platform is also adding live sporting events including boxing matches and a new long-term deal with the WWE.\n\nComing back to its valuation, we’ve noticed that Netflix has always traded at a historically higher valuation ratio. Currently, it is trading at about 8x sales and 35x forward earnings. Nonetheless, comparing it to its past four-year price-to-sales ratio and taking into account its healthy 5-year revenue CAGR of 16%, there looks to be plenty of upside for NFLX moving forward.\n\nThe Home Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) is an American home improvement retail brand that was established in 1978 in Marietta, Georgia. Home Depot is a stock that both shareholders and analysts love. In March, Yahoo Finance analysts rated the stock as a Hold or higher, with 21 reiterating Buy or Strong Buy ratings.\n\nThe company recently announced an $18.25 billion acquisition for SRS Distribution, which is the largest deal in Home Depot’s history. Home Depot believes this will improve its reach to professional contracts and increase its total addressable market to more than $1 trillion! While the company expects this acquisition to dilute earnings-per-share for fiscal 2024, the long-term benefits of increasing its pro-builder market should outweigh any short-term pain for shareholders.\n\nAs with most blue-chip stocks, Home Depot trades at relatively safe multiples. The stock is trading at about 2.5x sales and 24x forward earnings. As revenues have plateaued post-pandemic, however, we notice that its P/E ratio has now settled slightly higher than its ten-year historical range. Nonetheless, we see its historically great shareholder returns and 35 consecutive years of strong dividends as reasons to stay bullish on this company into the coming months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter",
        "content": "The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.\n\nThe quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.\n\nSpeaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.\n\nOh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe good\n\nLet’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.\n\nAlso this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US. Nvidia's founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, meanwhile, made headlines for ending its electric car project. According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.\n\nFinally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe bad\n\nThings weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.\n\nThe FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”\n\nThe upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nThe DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball though, and are looking into whether they’re complying or not.\n\nThe hits kept coming for Google during the quarter, after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.\n\nCongress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.\n\nThe ugly\n\nNothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.\n\nFinally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat.\n\nIt’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement. That is to say, the good stories could flip and become bad or ugly and vice versa. On to Q2.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Most of those cuts are related to business changes in AWS training and certification programs as well as sales operations. The tech giant said it was also making cuts elsewhere so it can invest in other business priorities.\n\n“These decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham said in a statement.\n\nThe AWS layoffs follow other layoffs that happened at Amazon and its subsidiaries this year. In January, the company cut several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. That same month, Twitch, the popular social media platform owned by Amazon, laid off more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs. The online audiobook and podcast service Audible also laid off about 5% of its workforce.\n\nAmazon says it will continue to hire in priority areas.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 1 Other Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC tried to get to the bottom of the recent market decline amid rising yields and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plan. Cramer said that the latest market decline was not \"consequential\" because if the upcoming jobs report comes in weaker than expected, the market will rebound as people would expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to avoid a hard landing. Cramer said it's been a while since we saw a broader selloff, so we \"forgot\" how to \"handle\" one.\n\nCramer Explains the \"Real\" Reasons Behind the Latest Selloff\n\nThe CNBC host tried to get to the \"real reasons\" behind the latest selloff and found them in earnings, which he said are always important for him. Cramer first talked about payroll solutions company Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) which recently posted downbeat sales for the fiscal third quarter ending February 29, 2024. Cramer specifically highlighted Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO comments delivered during the company's latest earnings call where he talked about some trends he's seeing in the jobs market.\n\n\"But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now.\n\nOur clients tell us they still can’t find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients.\" [read the full earnings call transcript here.]\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer then turned to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he believes does not deserve to be in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks anymore. Cramer said that the problems Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing have to do with the overall declining demand for EVs in the US. He said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing what Ford and GM had already faced.\n\nCramer said that the \"real problem\" with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is that it turned out to be a car company instead of an \"immortal tech company.\" However, Cramer said Tesla is a \"headline grabber\" and it always will be.\n\nCramer Recommends Investors to \"Hunker Down\" and Wait\n\nJim Cramer reiterated that we should always expect a 10% pullback on average every two years, based on the analysis of legendary economist Peter Lynch.  He also said that there weren’t \"many\" stocks that saw declines in the latest selloff. Instead, he thinks most of the losses were seen by individual stocks based on specific events and catalysts. Cramer thinks the market was overbought and the selloff was due, and he said it's not over yet. Cramer recommend investors to \"hunker down\" and wait for the markets to rebound.\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending mega-cap quality names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past few months as he's highly bullish on the AI revolution that is boosting several names under his coverage. Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few weeks and picked some of the most important stocks he discussed. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, where applicable. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nOn March 26, when Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) was skyrocketing, Cramer said on CNBC that if I were Donald Trump \"this is the moment\" when you'd say it's time to release more shares.\n\n\"I am not sure where Mr. Trump's head is, but this is a moment where he could say, look, the stock's up 286%. No one would mind if I sold stock, so please let me do it.\"\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) shares have pared gains since. The stock is down 26% over the past five days as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) recently revealed that it had a net loss of about $58 million in 2023, while revenue in the period was $4.1 million.\n\n10. AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer is highly bearish on mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). A caller recently asked Cramer whether he should buy AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) stock for dividends. Cramer’s reply was a resounding “No.” He asked the questioner to see how the stock has performed over the past few years, or “any period” for that matter. Cramer said this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” Cramer is bearish on AGNC but recommends buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for the long term.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). The biggest stakeholder of AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) during this period was Karim Abbadi and Edward Mcbride’s Centiva Capital which owns a $16 million stake in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC).\n\n9. Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nWater handling and recycling solutions company Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about recently. Cramer said that he’s a bit late to the stock since Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have “almost doubled.” Cramer said he’d wait for a pullback in the stock price.\n\n“Let’s see if we can get it back to $10.”\n\nAris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have gained about 64% so far this year.\n\n8. Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nTexas-based software company Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) stock is a Buy, according to Jim Cramer. When asked about the stock, Cramer said that it's a very \"well-run\" company. He also said that a government business is a \"good business.\"\n\nTyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) is one of the stocks seeing heavy insider selling activity this year. John S Marr Jr, Tyler Technologies Inc's (NYSE:TYL) former CEO and current executive chairman of the board, sold 7,500 shares of Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) on March 13 at $425.07 per share.\n\nHere is what Andvari Associates has to say about Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. Companies with high growth prospects, like Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), also declined. A third group also declined: our investments in fixed income and preferred securities for retirement accounts naturally declined in value as the prices of these securities go down when interest rates go up.”\n\n7. Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on automated electronic broker platform company Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR). When asked about the stock in a latest program, Cramer said that it’s an “incredibly well-run company” and “everybody feels that way.” In the same vein Jim Cramer also recommended investors to consider buying Charles Schwab shares. In addition to IBKR, Cramer is recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nInteractive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) shares have gained about 39% over the past one year.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Third quarter’s earnings were above consensus estimates, aided by the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses. Despite the beat, its shares lost -4% due to reduced expectations around inorganic account growth as two new Asian broker relationships have been pushed out.”\n\n6. Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 51\n\nJim Cramer hit the “Buy, Buy, Buy” button on Texas-based construction engineering company Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) during a latest Lightning Round segment of his program Mad Money on CNBC. Cramer said that Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is “just fantastic.” He said Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is a great infrastructure player.\n\n“I think you’ve got a winner there.”\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Along with DexCom, notable adds in the quarter included Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) and Jabil. Quanta provides outsourced skilled labor for maintenance and construction services, primarily to utilities. We have followed the company for over a decade and have witnessed its shift from oil and gas to renewables. The energy transition (solar and wind farms, electric vehicles, etc.) requires investments in the US energy grid to support greater electrification. At the same time, climate change is increasing stress on the existing grid, forcing utilities to increase maintenance spending. Furthermore, Federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, will help fuel Quanta’s long-term growth given its expertise in transmission and distribution connections as renewable energy infrastructure seeks to connect to the grid. The stock sold off early in the quarter on concerns that higher interest rates would lead to a pullback in renewables investments by utility customers. However, based on our industry research, we think Quanta’s key customers are well resourced and committed to meeting long-term electrification needs via infrastructure investment. We used the selloff as an opportunity to move the position into the CropSM at a more attractive valuation.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Retail Pharmacy Stocks to Watch and One to Avoid Amid Industry Headwinds",
        "content": "The three-year-long historic public health crisis significantly altered the structure and trend of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry. On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\r\n\r\nHerbalife Ltd HLF is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased the competitiveness in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon’s AMZN entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy’s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon’s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. In October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately, accelerate customer service and ensure the right quantities of medications in stock.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market.  With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon’s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in recent times in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments.\n\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%) and text messages (29%). The companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #234, placing it in the bottom 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 Composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 29.7%. The S&P 500 Composite has risen 28.4% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.50X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.38X and the sector’s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus and 1 to Avoid\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. The company is investing in emerging technology capabilities such as voice, artificial intelligence and robotics to automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for its constituents. CVS Health’s solid digital engagement and enhanced capabilities should strengthen its ability to drive seasonal flu and RFD immunization awareness and connect patients to the CVS locations for these important health services.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a 3.6% rise from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 9.1%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CVS\n\nWalgreens Boots continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company’s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach.  At present, Walgreens Boots 11 micro-fulfilment centers currently support 4,600 stores.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.4% from the 2023 reported figure. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nPrice and Consensus: WBA\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently experiencing a decline in sales. Herbalife's direct-selling business model and product range, which includes weight management and nutrition products, are facing challenges amid a complex economic environment.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a plunge of 18.5% from the 2023 reported figure. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is -4%.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying 2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has created substantial shareholder value in recent months. The stock has soared 517% since the beginning of 2023 amid surging interest in artificial intelligence (AI). But several billionaire hedge fund managers sold down their positions in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, while purchasing other AI stocks.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%. David Tepper of Appaloosa sold 235,000 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 23%.\n\nThose three billionaires have two important traits in common. They rank among the 15 most successful hedge fund managers in history, and they beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past three years. Those qualities lend them credibility.\n\nWith that in mind, all three hedge fund managers bought shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the fourth quarter. Englander and Tepper also started positions in HubSpot(NYSE: HUBS). Those companies have already achieved a strong presence in certain AI markets -- Amazon in cloud AI developer services, and HubSpot in AI sales assistant software -- but both are leaning into AI product development in a way that could create more shareholder value.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is working from a position of strength in all three markets. To elaborate, Amazon runs the most-visited online marketplace in the world, which has naturally made it the largest retail advertiser in the world. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, as well as several subcategories, including artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.\n\nAmazon is leaning into AI to improve its standing in all three markets. It recently launched a generative AI shopping assistant called Rufus, and it uses machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes for its logistics business. Amazon also introduced a generative AI tool that creates marketing content for advertisers, and the company continuously tweaks its machine learning models to make product recommendations more relevant.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, AWS has made its cloud platform more compelling with two new products: Bedrock is a service for customizing large language models and building generative AI applications, and Amazon Q is a generative AI business assistant that queries and summarizes data from various internal and external sources. CEO Andy Jassy believes generative AI alone will create \"tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nAmazon reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion, operating margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter, and non-GAAP net income improved to $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\nGoing forward, Amazon has a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. I say that because retail e-commerce sales are forecasted to increase at 8% annually, the digital advertising market is expected to expand at 15% annually, and the cloud computing market is projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030.\n\nWall Street analysts have similar expectations. The consensus calls for Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years. That makes its current valuation of 3.3 times sales appear reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in this stock today, especially as part of a larger basket of AI stocks.\n\n2. HubSpot\n\nHubSpot specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its platform includes applications for marketing, sales, customer service, and operations teams, as well as tools for commerce and content management. Those products help businesses generate leads, convert leads into customers, and maintain lasting relationships with those customers.\n\nHubSpot designed its CRM platform with small and medium-sized businesses in mind. Customers in that underserved market segment find its user-friendly interface, simple software, and freemium pricing attractive. As a result, HubSpot has achieved a strong presence in several product categories, especially sales and marketing software. Indeed, Morningstar sees HubSpot as a leader in both spaces, and IT consultancy Gartner recently recognized its leadership in marketing automation software, highlighting investments in AI as a key differentiator.\n\nHubSpot delivered a solid financial report for the fourth quarter, surpassing expectations on the top and bottom lines. Its customer count climbed 23% to top 205,000, while the average subscription revenue per customer increased one percentage point. In turn, revenue rose 24% to $582 million, due to especially strong momentum in sales software, and non-GAAP net income increased 53% to $98 million.\n\nGoing forward, HubSpot aims to drive adoption of higher-end products by adding more sophisticated functionality and engaging larger businesses. To accomplish that, the company is rolling out a slate of AI capabilities during the first half of this year, most of which are exclusive to more expensive product tiers. Those capabilities include predictive AI for sales forecasts and content recommendations, as well as generative AI for marketing copy and content summaries.\n\nWall Street expects HubSpot to grow sales at 17% annually during the next five years, but that estimate leaves room for upside. HubSpot is a recognized leader in AI sales assistant software for small businesses, and ongoing investments in AI could be a powerful growth driver. That said, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales seems reasonable even if the Wall Street consensus is correct. Now is a good time for long-term investors to buy a small position in this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion's share of the heavy lifting has been done by the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have taken Wall Street to new heights\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%. MSFT Chart\n\nThe second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter. Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in April: Meta Platforms\n\nAmong the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.\n\nBut there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta.\n\nAs noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta.\n\nSomething that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028.

The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nSomething else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace.\n\nAs I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers.\n\nRegulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nLast but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend. This makes Nvidia a stock worth avoiding in April.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "'Just walk out' technology allowed shoppers to grab items and leave without paying at the checkout - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\n\nAmazon is scrapping its “just walk out” technology in the US after years of trying to gain traction for its checkout-free offer.\n\nThe decision to ditch the grocery store technology was revealed on Tuesday, although the move will not affect outlets in the UK.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, the system has allowed shoppers to grab items and leave without paying at the checkout, with customers instead charged through their Amazon accounts.\n\nTony Hoggett, the senior vice president of Amazon’s grocery stores, told The Information that it will now prioritise smart trolley technology in the US rather than just walk out equipment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmazon’s so-called Dash Cart system was launched in 2020 and tracks items as shoppers put them in their trolleys.\n\nThis includes being able to weigh items and give people real-time receipts. Customers subsequently leave stores through special lanes where their cards are charged.\n\nThis system allows shoppers to track their spending in real-time rather than waiting for a receipt under the “just walk out” model.\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said the company had invested “a lot of time redesigning a number of our Amazon Fresh stores over the last year”.\n\nThey added: “We’ve also heard from customers that while they enjoyed the benefit of skipping the checkout line with just walk out, they also wanted the ability to easily find nearby products and deals, view their receipt as they shop, and know how much money they saved while shopping throughout the store.”\n\nAmazon opened its first checkout-free supermarket in London in early 2021 as part of its push into physical stores.\n\nHowever, in August 2022, it paused a roll-out of its cashierless grocery stores in the UK.\n\nEarly last year, it unveiled a wider hiatus as said it would be closing some sites. This led to the online retail giant taking a $720m (£590m) writedown on its bricks-and-mortar portfolio.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, said the company was “not going to expand the physical Fresh stores” until it had established how it could provide a “different offering”.\n\nRival supermarkets have dipped their toes into checkout-free shopping. However, many have directed spending towards cheaper alternatives such as more self-service tills.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.\n\nThe company’s well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.\n\nWhile redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convivence of skipping the checkout line.\n\nAmazon's decision was first reported by The Information.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\n\nDespite predictions Amazon’s entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that Amazon was working to find the right formula that will allow it to have a larger impact on physical grocery. The company has shut down some Amazon Fresh and Go stores that weren’t living up to their promise and said early last year that it was pausing expansion on Fresh stores.\n\nIn November, the company reopened three Fresh stores in Los Angeles, California. Golden, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company is now focused on “selectively” opening new Fresh stores and remodeling the majority of its existing stores.\n\nJust Walk Out technology will continue to be offered in Amazon Go stores and some smaller Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K., the company said. It will also continue offering the technology to third-party retailers.",

        "content": "Generally, when new technology is introduced, investment opportunities are speculative and risky. This happened first with personal computers, and now, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. By now, nearly every big tech company has its hands firmly inside the AI cookie jar, with most small and mid-cap companies also following suit. It’s not an overstatement to say that AI has the potential to be the biggest game-changer in technology since the internet itself.\n\nThe best AI investments will provide a platform for other tangential businesses. Not only will they be utilizing AI to better serve their customers, but they will be also building new AI-driven products and services to forever change industry dynamics. Here are our three picks for the best AI stocks to consider for your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s largest companies and owns several dominant brands in the tech industry. These include Google Search, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Currently, the stock’s median price target of $163.12 represents a potential 10% upside from its current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite facing a couple of missteps at the start, this big tech company has been one of the first to jump right into the AI waters. Google Bard, for instance, made headlines for producing inaccurate responses that put it a level below ChatGPT. Now though, beyond simply Google Bard, Google has launched AI appliances such as Vertex AI and Project IDX to help websites, workspaces and workflow. As Gemini (a rebranded Bard) slowly becomes the leading generative AI platform integrated into Google’s suite of applications, investors can be optimistic about this company’s strength as one of the AI industry’s leaders.\n\nAlphabet also remains one of the cheapest mega-cap stocks relative to its competitors, trading at just 22.27x forward earnings and 6.25x sales. In terms of earnings, this makes GOOGL cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Alphabet’s strength is also demonstrated by its 14 consecutive quarters of increased revenue and five-year revenue CAGR of 18%. As far as AI and blue-chip tech stocks go for us, GOOGL is a no-brainer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company most recognized for its flagship products including Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, and Premiere. Yahoo Finance analysts currently give a consensus average price target of about $574.00, 15% higher than today’s closing price.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, you might not immediately think of Adobe. Nonetheless, the company has been leveraging generative AI to give its creative customers some of the most comprehensive artistic tools. These include the Adobe Firefly platform which will drastically grow the scale of deliverable AI-generated branded content for enterprise users and content creators. In fact, one of the early adopters of Adobe Firefly was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which used the platform to create its Dreamworld campaign.\n\nLooking at its financials, we see a stock that trades at roughly a fair value compared to its tech industry peers. However, where Adobe truly stands out is its profitability. Adobe currently has an 88.08% gross margin, over 80% higher than its sector median of 48.62%! With a 10-year net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as well, we see Adobe as a profitability cash cow in the AI space.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American multinational cybersecurity company that was founded in 2011. Yahoo Finance analysts almost all rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a median one-year price target nearly 20% higher than its current price.\n\nThe bull case for Crowdstrike and AI is twofold. The first case is based on its Falcon platform. This platform is trained on trillions of historical security events and utilizes AI and machine learning to identify, detect, and neutralize potential threats. Additionally, Crowdstrike also has a generative AI security analyst named Charlotte that can help users with its diverse range of products. As elevated cybersecurity concerns arise due to the increase in AI used for malicious reasons, we see Crowdstrike as an investment at the forefront of solving these issues.\n\nCRWD has already gained nearly 150% over the past 52 weeks. While its valuation is slightly elevated over its sector mean, we find confidence in its outstanding balance between growth and profitability. For instance, despite growing at a five-year revenue CAGR Of 65%, CRWD has still managed to maintain incredibly strong gross margins of over 75%!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is removing its cashierless Just Walk Out technology from grocery stores, a retreat from an ambitious system designed to let shoppers skip the line.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead Trump Media’s Business Doesn’t Matter Iran Vows to Punish Israel for Strike on Embassy in Syria Caribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU Crackdown Erdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal Elections\n\nAmazon will remove the system as it remodels existing Fresh grocery stores and won’t feature it in new locations that will start opening later this year, an Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nTony Hoggett, Amazon’s senior vice president of grocery stores, joined the company in 2022 and launched a far-reaching revamp of the company’s grocery business, which has struggled to build market share in an industry dominated by the likes of Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co.\n\nAmazon has also scaled back its ambitions for the Dash Cart, which let shoppers scan items as they go. The carts initially relied on cameras to identify what shoppers had grabbed from the shelf. Now they mostly identify items with a traditional scanner, although shoppers can still use a touchscreen to ring up merchandise without bar codes.\n\nThe Information reported the scrapping of Just Walk Out technology earlier.\n\nThe system used ceiling-mounted cameras and shelf sensors, backed by algorithms, to determine what a shopper took from a store. Customers were charged automatically upon exiting.\n\nThe company began developing the technology more than a decade ago, part of a push by Jeff Bezos, then chief executive officer, to develop a unique offering to accompany Amazon’s move into physical stores.\n\nThe system debuted in 2018 with the opening of a convenience store in the lobby of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. The company built dozens of Amazon Go branded convenience stores and later installed the cashierless technology in Fresh Stores and a pair of Whole Foods Market locations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe technology alienated some shoppers, who were put off by entry gates or the feeling that Amazon had turned a visit to the grocery store into a high-tech vending machine. Receipts, which arrived digitally a few minutes to hours after a shopper checked out, also weren’t practical for big shops.\n\nAmazon Go stores will still use Just Walk Out technology, and the company will continue to license it to other retailers. Smaller stores in the UK also will keep using the system.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned FTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Thinking Small, Winning Big: 7 Small-Cap Stocks to Supercharge Your Portfolio",
        "content": "If you’re searching for the best small-cap stocks to buy right now, look no further. Small-cap stocks are set to continue their record run as indices like the S&P 600 begin building momentum in light of rate cutting expectations and an improved economic outlook. Since nearly all companies, even the largest, started as small-caps, the sector tends to outperform larger indices in the long term.\n\nWe’re in a particularly unique position, as a year’s worth of higher rates means the worst or least viable companies are on their way out or didn’t survive the financial realignment. Today’s small-cap stocks, therefore, tend to be the strongest of the bunch, with management adept at navigating monetary policy changes and rapidly shifting economic conditions. These seven small-cap stocks stand out as some of the best of the bunch and could prove a solid foundation for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: PubMatic Inc (PUBM) The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital advertising is quickly becoming a perennial sector that tends to retain strength even amid poor economic conditions. While consumer spending may dip and eat into sales growth, the best digital advertising companies successfully navigate shifting conditions to stay afloat, if not thrive. PubMatic Inc (NASDAQ:PUBM) is among just a handful of small-cap digital advertising and media stocks that are successfully adapting to changing preferences – and thriving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year, record revenue figures for the small-cap advertising company hit $267 million in sales. Staying true to its small-cap growth stock designation, the company is plunging excess earnings into a comprehensive growth strategy to build on that momentum. Plans include improved customer acquisition strategies, revenue stream expansion, and increased machine learning emphasis to “[build and scale] ROI and outcomes-based advertising solutions that rival the walled gardens,” with walled gardens being a term describing the largest and impenetrable advertising heavyweights with closed ecosystems like Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAligned much more closely with the “value” side of the value/growth continuum than PubMatic, Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is nevertheless a standout small-cap stock offering investors long-term upside potential alongside short-term stability. To the latter point, the company’s gained nearly 50% over the past year and currently offers a 3.06% forward dividend yield – not bad for a company with less than $1.5 billion in market capitalization!\n\nBut investors looking for small-cap value stocks to buy shouldn’t focus on dividends alone. Instead, look to Steelcase’s steady revenue and rapidly increasing net income, which hit $777 million and $30.8 million in the most recent quarterly report. To that end, the company’s fiscal year 2025 outlook is especially enticing as it capitalizes on a steadier economy and continued remote work trends. Management reported 10% higher sales in the first three weeks of the fiscal year alone and is targeting 1% – 5% revenue growth and EPS between 85 cents and $1.00. Steelcase reported a year’s end EPS of 68 cents, so the rosy executive outlook should be enough to spark interest in small-cap value investors.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor stocks surged over the past year, but mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). As semiconductor demand remains high, but the biggest names tilt toward massive overvaluation, investors will increasingly turn to small-cap semiconductor stocks to find the “next big thing.” Few small-cap semiconductor stocks are as robust as indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI). The company’s offerings focus primarily on automotive and self-driving car semiconductor applications, which are increasingly in demand as new car sales climb and drivers demand state-of-the-art luxuries like driver assistance and enjoyable infotainment displays.\n\nThe company’s 2023 revenue was record-setting, climbing more than 100% to hit $223.2 million. Likewise, the company’s profit margins are beyond reproach at 52.5% in 2023, more than 2.5% higher than the prior year. This margin expansion indicates that the company is not only navigating shifting economic conditions but also thriving as it finds ways to improve efficiencies and cut costs without sacrificing quality.\n\nChegg Inc (CHGG) a child takes notes while attending an online class. represents education stocks. edtech stocks\n\nSource: Travelerpix / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) is a small-cap tech stock capturing one of the AI-adjacent sectors I’m particularly bullish on: education and EdTech. This year saw increased scrutiny and even dismissal of legacy learning institutions, even the most elite, and I think artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging remote work and learning tech will be among the next massive social revolutions. Chegg is adapting AI to a range of learning applications, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant. The tool is built on the back of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and represents one of the few, if not only, broadly successful adaptations or applications of the tools within the EdTech sector.\n\nOf course, new and next-gen tools tend to be costly and unpredictable early in their lifecycle. To that end, Chegg shares dropped more than 30% since 2024 began, primarily on the heels of a less-than-desirable earnings report that included a more modest forecast than analysts expected. Still, Chegg’s management acknowledged the rough patch as part of its R&D into AI EdTech applications, telling investors that its development is “ongoing and iterative” but that R&D costs mean it’s also “too early to predict when we will return to revenue and margin growth.” Still, at its current price point and relatively low valuation, Chegg is a top small-cap stock to capitalize on EdTech’s AI-enabled future.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: H&R Block (HRB) a man in a suit pulling a large bag of money with a rope. hot small-cap stocks for January 2024\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHave you filed your taxes yet? If not, you may be one of many Americans scrambling over the next two weeks, setting H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) for another solid earnings season. One of the primary concerns about companies like H&R Block is the inherent cyclical nature of their business – tax time comes every April, so customers tend to flock to the platform in January but fall off by mid-spring. However, H&R Block’s recent initiatives to smooth its sales cycle are bearing fruit, as spin-off initiatives like its Spruce mobile banking platform set increasingly higher client acquisition and retention rates.\n\nH&R Block’s last financial filing attributed more than $26 million in quarterly revenue to the banking platform. At roughly one-fourth of tax prep sales, that’s still a solid stat – especially when considering $26 million represents customer deposits quadrupling. As rates stay steady or fall, H&R Block will be able to capitalize on increasing deposit rates more and ultimately see income from peripheral financial services surge.\n\nValley National Bancorp An image of a cellphone with a bank on top, surrounded by people and piles of money, a credit card and calculator. fintech stocks\n\nSource: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock\n\nI wrote about Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) last week, focusing on the company’s potential strength as a cannabis stock. However, there’s far more to this small-cap regional bank than its cannabis-centric initiatives. Trading at just 0.6x book value and 7.5x earnings, the small-cap financial stock is undervalued and, in many cases, under-appreciated. Valley’s strong balance sheet and relatively low debt load (a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56, compared to the industry’s 1.2 average) means that management is positioned to adapt to whatever economic conditions may come, as evidenced by its newest stock buyback plan and 5.71% trailing dividend yield.\n\nAnalysts broadly see Valley National as undervalued, with an average $9.50 price target that sits about 20% above today’s per-share pricing. Likewise, they’re increasingly bullish about the small-cap bank stock as 56% call the stock a “hold”, compared to 50% calling for investors to sell during the previous polling period.\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) a photo of someone typing on a laptop on a wooden table with computer-related images\n\nSource: My Life Graphic/Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has been on a wild ride thus far in 2024, surging to nearly $45 per share after a solid earnings report before falling back down to pre-earnings levels where it sits today (slightly above $25 per share). But much of that decline seems to be investors merely taking profit rather than a substantial statement about GigaCloud’s long-term potential. The company, whose closest analog is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trades at just 11x earnings. Those looking at the stock with skepticism considering Alibaba’s fall from grace should consider one major differentiator: GigaCloud services B2B markets and, more than just offering product sourcing, is an all-in-one vendor management platform to navigate cross-border payments and other tricky facets of global eCommerce that small businesses tend to struggle with.\n\nThe small-and-medium-sized business (SMB) market is largely unaddressed, and GigaCloud’s solutions include payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and even warehouse storage. This all-in-one package is a boon to SMBs struggling to compete with or work through larger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As time goes on and companies like Amazon increasingly squeeze SMBs through fee and fulfillment rate hikes, those going it alone will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Wall Street ended the first quarter on an impressive note after a solid 2023. All the major indexes hit fresh record highs, and the rally is expected to continue as the Federal Reserve has indicated at least three rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nThe Dow and the S&P 500 were the first to hit a record high. The Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up in the race but did so in February end. In the first quarter, the Nasdaq gained 9.1%.\n\nTech stocks were responsible for the broader market rally in 2023 and the momentum has continued into this year.\n\nThe tech rally is being fueled by the ongoing optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, spearheaded by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nAI holds immense potential and the world is yet to witness it, several experts believe. NVIDIA’s success over the past year has inspired several other tech companies, big and small, to shift focus to AI to ensure more business opportunities in the coming days.\n\nThe advancement of smart devices is greatly influencing this domain, as they necessitate computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nSuch operations demand high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and enhanced graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are fostering favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry to thrive.\n\nInterestingly, the Nasdaq rally comes despite inflation coming in hotter than expected in the first two months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 0.4% sequentially in February, higher than a rise of 0.3% in the prior month and the biggest increase since September 2023. Core PPI also rose 0.4% month over month in February.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve said last month that it still plans three rate cuts of 25 basis points each by the end of this year. Although the Fed didn’t give a timeline, market participants believe the first rate cut is likely to happen in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Logitech International LOGI and Microsoft Corporation MSFT, whichhave strong potential in 2024.

        "title": "The 3 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "The best cloud computing stocks may have taken a backseat to some of the higher-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, specifically those in the semiconductor scene. Still, many leading cloud players also stand to gain from continued interest and investment in AI-related things.\n\nFrom the massive public cloud players to some less obvious plays focusing heavily on their AI-focused data center capabilities, cloud computing plays are definitely still worth following. Further, the cloud may actually be a source of reasonable valuations as investors begin to insist on some of the AI-at-a-reasonable-price (a potential variant of GARP?) types of plays. As AI’s influence works its way into other tech sub-sectors, I think growth rates could be in a spot to surprise over the next year or two.\n\nLet’s look to the best cloud computing stocks for potential growth stocks that value-conscious investors may wish to focus on heading into April.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Amazon Web Services (AWS) gearing up for the next generation of AI, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands to be a cloud computing stock that you simply cannot ignore. Yes, it’s one of the more obvious public cloud players that will benefit from the AI boom. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean an investment in AMZN stock can’t do well over time, especially at today’s multiples, which I view as very reasonable.\n\nAs Amazon gets its hands on the latest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell line of AI chips, don’t expect momentum in the AWS business to grind to a halt anytime soon. As the economy heats up and enterprises crank up their AI-related spending, AWS will be ready to pick up where it left off before the last few years of mild macro headwinds.\n\nFarther out, the Amazon Bedrock platform, its foundation model Titan, and its own chips (Trainium and Inferium for training and inference purposes, respectively) could become bigger needle movers for AMZN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another cloud darling that stands to be a big winner in the AI revolution as it continues to advance Einstein for its CRM customers. However, the company isn’t just equipped to thrive in that corner of the enterprise.\n\nAs Salesforce embeds next-generation AI technologies into Slack, its workplace communication platform, the firm seems poised to become one of the most influential beneficiaries in the corner of enterprise AI.\n\nSlack AI can save many employees tons of time as various aspects of the workday become automated. From AI-generated thread summaries to the incorporation of AI-driven Slack apps, I think there’s no denying the power of Salesforce’s ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wild card, though, is CEO Marc Benioff’s focus on AI ethics and safety. In the AI age, such a focus is key to steering clear of potential regulatory roadblocks in the future as Salesforce’s innovations are built to play by the rules.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) stock has been subject to big analyst price targets and rating upgrades in recent weeks following its wonderful quarter. The company isn’t merely hopping on the AI bandwagon now that it’s moving; it’s been investing aggressively across many aspects of AI for quite some time now.\n\nFollowing the firm’s recent quarter, we’ll have to throw Oracle into the conversation when discussing AI-leveraging cloud kings. As AI flies into the cloud, look for the $345 billion giant to “floor it” as it hopes to close the gap with some of its even larger rivals in the enterprise AI scene.\n\nAt this pace, it may be a matter of time before Oracle breaks into a league alongside AWS. Of course, only time will tell. Regardless, I’d look for the Fusion Cloud applications suite to act as a potential needle-mover in future quarters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon and Salesforce.

        "title": "When You Look Back in 5 Years, You'll Wish You'd Bought This Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began as an online bookseller when it was founded in 1994. E-commerce remains the company's largest source of revenue, but it has also expanded into other areas of the technology sector, including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI could be one of the greatest financial opportunities in history, and Amazon is tackling it from multiple angles. The company just made the final payment of its agreed $4 billion investment into leading AI start-up Anthropic, a deal that will accelerate Amazon's progress on both the hardware and software sides.\n\nAmazon is one of six companies valued at $1 trillion or more, and all of its peers have a presence in AI. However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch. Here's why investors might regret not buying it when they look back on this moment in five years.\n\nAmazon is cementing itself as a leader in artificial intelligence\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services platform in the world. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI.\n\nThe hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads.\n\nHowever, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.\n\nBut some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nReady-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Amazon-Anthropic deal will accelerate progress on all fronts\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.\n\nAnthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code.\n\nAnthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider.\n\nMicrosoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race.\n\nAmazon is the cheapest trillion-dollar stock by this metric\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).\n\nNevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2.\n\nAs the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google). NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation.\n\nHowever, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nTherefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential. As it grows to become a larger contributor to Amazon's overall revenue, it will make the entire organization more profitable. When investors look back on this moment in a handful of years, they might be glad they bought Amazon stock at its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCould Goldilocks Run in Q2 Be Even More Thrilling?\n\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\n\nSolid Fundamentals of the U.S. Economy\n\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\n\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.\n\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Saga to Continue in the Long Term\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\n\nStrong Expectations for Q1 2024 Earnings\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\n\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nFed’s Rate Cut Indications\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AMZN has surged 18.8% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.\n\nBy the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock may be in a bubble\n\nOver the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nNvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.\n\nNvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.\n\nThe chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.\n\nHere are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.\n\n1. Alphabet: $1.88 trillion current market cap (Class A shares, GOOGL)\n\nThe first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nThe reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.\n\n2. Amazon: $1.87 trillion current market cap\n\nLike Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nHowever, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: $1.24 trillion current market cap\n\nEven though social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.\n\nMeta's \"secret sauce\" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.\n\nThe other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match. BRK.A Chart\n\n4. Berkshire Hathaway: $908 billion current market cap (Class A shares, BRK.A)\n\nA fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!\n\nOne of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the \"Oracle of Omaha's\" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.\n\nWarren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.\n\n5. Visa: $573 billion current market cap\n\nThe fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa(NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.\n\nWhat makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nVisa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: You'll Regret Not Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) became a Wall Street darling last year when it cornered the market on artificial intelligence (AI) chips and earned its spot in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a phrase used to describe the seven most prominent tech companies. As a result, the company's stock is up 242% since last March, almost entirely based on excitement over its AI prospects.\n\nWith the industry projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030, it's no wonder investors have flocked to the market. However, plenty of companies are moving into AI and could have more room to run than Nvidia or might be trading at a better value than the chipmaker.\n\nConsequently, it's a good idea to look for alternative ways to invest in the budding sector. Other companies in the Magnificent Seven are an excellent place to start, with many known for their reliability over the long term and heavy investment in AI.\n\nSo forget Nvidia. You'll regret not buying these Magnificent Seven stocks instead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai describes the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" This year, a poor debut for its new large language model Gemini created doubt over its potential in the industry. However, the company remains a behemoth in tech, with significant cash reserves that will likely see the company retain its dominance and eventually catch up to its AI rivals.\n\nIn-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and Google have granted Alphabet a powerful position in tech. These brands attract billions of users and have helped the company's annual revenue rise 90% in the last five years, with operating income up 135%. Meanwhile, Alphabet's many products create almost endless opportunities to boost its business with AI.\n\nImproving Gemini could see Alphabet offer more effective advertising, develop a search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, better analyze viewing trends on YouTube, and expand its AI cloud services on Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe chart above shows Alphabet's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. These are helpful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health, and the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's free cash flow of nearly $70 billion, compared to Nvidia's $27 billion, suggests it's potentially better equipped to keep investing in its business and overcome current headwinds.\n\nThe Google company may have hit a few roadblocks this year, but that's precisely why now is the perfect time to make long-term investments in its stock. The Magnificent Seven company has an exciting outlook for the coming years and trades at a bargain, compared to Nvidia.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) delivered impressive growth in 2023 after facing declines from an economic downturn in 2022. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion.\n\nA solid recovery in its e-commerce earnings over the last year has seen the company's free cash flow soar 904% to surpass $32 billion. This indicates it has the financial resources to continue expanding and manage possible hurdles.\n\nAmazon has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out of Seattle almost 30 years ago. The tech giant has expanded into multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nAmazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, the table above indicates Nvidia's earnings could reach $36 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Amazon's may achieve $7 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios (Nvidia's 36 and Amazon's 43) yields stock prices of $1,309 for Nvidia and $301 for Amazon.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 45% by fiscal 2026 and Amazon's increase by 67%. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and expanding position in AI, Amazon is a Magnificent Seven stock worth considering over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $180.97, moving +0.33% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.6%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.11%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the online retailer had gained 1.21% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.13% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.81, signifying a 161.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $142.42 billion, up 11.83% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.08 per share and revenue of $641.36 billion. These totals would mark changes of +40.69% and +11.58%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.46% higher. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at valuation, Amazon is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 44.19. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.33.\n\nAlso, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Commerce industry stood at 0.69 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 59, this industry ranks in the top 24% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Amazon (AMZN) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in AMZN?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $4.08.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

        "title": "Snub VIX's Climb, Focus on S&amp;P 500's Striking Rise: 4 Picks",
        "content": "An out-of-the-ordinary thing happened in the stock market in the first quarter. Wall Street’s fear gauge, better known as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), and the broader S&P 500 climbed northward in the period.\n\nNow, VIX is always associated with distress among investors, and the stock market may be bracing for a selloff. However, the S&P 500 hasn’t witnessed a pullback of more than 2% in quite some time and has instead registered its strongest first-quarter gains since 2019.\n\nThe VIX has jumped 4.5% since the beginning of the quarter to around 13, which is way below its long-term average of 20. On the other hand, the S&P 500 surged 10.2% during the first three-month period of this year and notched its 22nd record closing high of the year. The index achieved its first 17 record-high close in the first 50 trading sessions of this year, per Bespoke Investment Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 also outpaced other major bourses like the Dow and the Nasdaq, which gained 5.6% and 9.1%, respectively. Thus, it can be safely assumed that investors aren’t nervous this time around. Moreover, the VIX gained traction after hitting a closing low in December due to the mean reversion nature of implied volatility.\n\nNonetheless, the S&P 500’s marvelous rise was driven by AI optimism and expectations that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates later this year. Tech stocks particularly advanced by leaps and bounds as AI contributed toward countless technological developments. Meanwhile, the Fed assured three interest rate cuts in the second half of 2024, and Chair Jerome Powell was not taken aback by the recent uptick in inflation. The Fed disregarded the jump in February’s PCE index.\n\nConsumer outlays, by the way, picked up last month after a lull at the commencement of the year.  In that way, household spending boosted economic growth and helped the stock market scale upward as well. Consumer spending in the United States increased by 0.8% in February, its biggest gain since January 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, with recession worries on the ebb and the S&P 500 moving up, it’s prudent for astute investors to place their bets on solid stocks listed on the index that have not only gained in the first quarter but also are positioned to advance in the near future.\n\nThese stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK, W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11.2% over the past 60 days. AMZN’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 40.7%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is a leading producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear. Deckers Outdoor currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.4% over the past 60 days. DECK’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 38.7%.\n\nW.W. Grainger is a business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating products and services. W.W. Grainger currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GWW’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.1%.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 19.5% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 84%.\n\nShares of Amazon, Deckers Outdoor, W.W. Grainger and NVIDIA have soared 18.7%, 40.8%, 22.8% and 82.5%, respectively, so far this year.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks You Can Buy Right Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "My favorite holding period is forever. Imagine owning a piece of a timeless business, one that grows its profits year in and year out, slowly generating life-changing wealth for you and your loved ones. Of course, those companies aren't easy to find. Most stocks don't earn a lifetime membership in an investor's portfolio.\n\nHowever, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hershey(NYSE: HSY) could qualify. I'll explain what makes them so special and why they're worth buying today and holding forever.\n\nA three-headed wealth machine\n\nThere's a good chance Amazon affects your life somehow. It's the dominant e-commerce company in America, with a whopping 38% of the market. Amazon Web Services, its cloud segment, underpins much of the internet.\n\nAnd if you are a football fan, Amazon is a media giant that streams National Football League games -- along with thousands of movies and shows -- making billions of dollars in ad revenue by doing it.\n\nNot only is Amazon's presence in these three industries impressive, but the size of these markets has also given Amazon the virtual real estate to grow into a multitrillion-dollar business. Today, it makes over $570 billion in revenue, pumping out $85 billion in operating profits that are reinvested into the company.\n\nIts advantage over the competition starts with its e-commerce business, which has become so large that it's tough to replicate. Its supply chain handles nearly a quarter of all packages shipped in the United States. That size, combined with its aggressive culture of innovation, makes it hard to see Amazon going away anytime soon. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nI like valuing the stock on its operating cash flow because Amazon invests heavily in growing the business, even at its current size. If you compare the share price to the operating cash flow per share, the stock is still cheap relative to its long-term average.\n\nInvestors can confidently add Amazon to their portfolios. And barring an unforeseen disaster, don't let go.\n\nStory continues\n\nSweet never goes out of style.\n\nHershey is on a completely different end of the spectrum. It makes chocolate and salty snacks. It's not a complex business model, but that can be good.\n\nIt's the brand that makes Hershey special. There are other confectionary companies on the market, but Hershey's name goes back over a century and its brands are routinely among Americans' favorites year-round. Who doesn't love a Hershey bar, Kit Kat, Twizzlers, Heath Bar, Jolly Rancher hard candies, or a Reese's peanut butter cup?\n\nThe company's popularity means it gets prime shelf space at points of sale, much like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do in the beverage industry. Hershey has an estimated 24% of the U.S. confectionary market, an impressive figure considering any company can make chocolate bars. It's the brand that makes the magic.\n\nThat translates to financials, too. Hershey is a simple and highly profitable business that earns an impressive 22% return on invested capital. That means that when Hershey pumps a dollar into its business, it gets $1.22 back. This signals that Hershey has pricing power, which is helping the company deal with a surge in cocoa prices that threatens to pressure its profit margins. HSY PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's bad news for the company, it's creating an opportunity for long-term investors. Shares have fallen to a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, below the company's long-term average.\n\nOver time, it should adapt to the higher cocoa prices, and there's a good chance the shortage will end and prices will normalize again. In other words, use a short-term problem to buy this excellent stock and enjoy the following years of dividends and price appreciation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Here's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "\"April showers bring May flowers.\" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.\n\nYou might not think the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.\n\nCrossing names off the list\n\nWe can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.\n\nIt's a similar story for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.\n\nWall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.\n\nThe \"A team\"\n\nThat leaves the \"A team\" as the top contenders: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.\n\nApple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Apple?\n\nI'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.\n\nBut Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI because of its \"incredible breakthrough potential.\" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.\n\nIt's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the \"wow\" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "20 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 20 most refugee-producing countries in the world. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the refugee crisis, you can directly go to the 5 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World.\n\nRefugee Situation Around the Globe\n\nThe UNHCR defines a refugee as someone forced to flee their country of origin as a result of persecution due to armed conflict, violence, or their identity, beliefs, and religion. The 2022 UNHCR Global Trends Report revealed that at the end of the year, there were 35.3 million refugees around the globe, 29.4 million of whom had a mandate of protection from the UNHCR. Another 5.9 million are cared for by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an organization set up particularly for Palestinian refugees. The total number of refugees at the end of 2021 had been 27.1 million, and hence, the growth till the end of 2022 was the largest yearly increase ever, according to the UNHCR database. In 2022, 339,300 refugees managed to return to their country of origin, and 114,300 were resettled.\n\n52% of the world’s entire refugee population comes only from three countries: the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. 70% of all refugees are hosted in countries neighboring the country of origin, which makes them some of the most refugee-hosting countries in the world. Low and middle-income countries host 76% of the world’s total displaced population. Türkiye is one of the world’s largest refugee hosts, home to almost 10% of the displaced population. Germany hosts 6%, whereas Europe as a whole hosts 36% of all the refugees currently displaced around the globe. Within the refugee population, 41% are children, 48% of whom remain out of school. Refugee children are 30% less likely than non-refugee children to complete primary school and 50% less likely to complete lower-secondary school. Only 68% of refugee children enroll in primary school, 37% in secondary school, and 6% in higher education or university.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmployment Conditions\n\nThe process of becoming a refugee carries a tremendous economic burden. Displaced individuals can often spend up to thousands of dollars in order to reach their country of refuge, which leaves them stranded without money for other essential needs. The UNHCR reports that two-thirds of refugees live in poverty. Thus, in this scenario, the provision of adequate employment opportunities becomes indispensable for refugee communities.\n\nIn 2016, the European Commission reported that refugees had an average employment rate of 56%, and it could take them up to two decades to achieve an employment rate similar to native-born individuals. The Commission also reports that almost 60% of all tertiary-educated employed refugees in the EU are overqualified for their positions, perhaps due to a lack of better opportunities.\n\nThe UNHCR further reports that 62% of refugees live in countries with restricted employment access, and 56% live in countries that do not recognize UNHCR or government-issued ID as a valid legal document for opening a bank account. Within Türkiye alone, 1 million Syrians are employed in the informal sector, and 75% earn less than the minimum wage. Furthermore, 59% of refugees live in countries with restricted access to registering and opening a business. This severe lack of opportunities is further worsened by issues such as language barriers and disproportionate discrimination against refugee populations. You can also take a look at the 15 Countries with the Most Climate Refugees in the World.\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe UNHCR runs several programs, such as cash-based interventions and microfinancing programs, that enable refugees to find employment and fend for themselves, but businesses also play a crucial role in this regard. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced on June 19, 2023, that it planned to employ 5,000 refugees in Europe within the next three years. This news came less than a year after Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had announced hiring 5,000 refugees within the US by the end of 2024. This was an excellent opportunity for countries with the most refugees in the US, as the program also provides access to other opportunities such as skills training and legal advice. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also working to provide training to almost 10,000 Ukrainians within its ITSkills4U program, a free opportunity for Ukrainians to advance their careers in IT.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another company providing opportunities to refugees. On June 19, 2023, the Tent Partnership for Refugees announced that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had been one of the 40 companies to pledge refugee support at the Tent European Business Summit. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) pledged that over the next three years, it would train around 5,000 refugees in essential IT skills, such as coding and cybersecurity, while also helping them gain a better understanding of the European job market. The company also provides entrepreneurial training to refugees so that they may be equipped with the tools required to set up one’s own business.\n\nWhile the general focus continues to be on the idea that refugee populations can cause economic burdens for host countries, a 2019 report by the American Immigration Council revealed their contributions as well. According to the report, in 2019, refugees in the US had contributed $25 billion in taxes and generated $5.1 billion in business income. Refugee populations across 17 states were showcased to have a combined spending power of $1 billion. Hosting refugees poses a critical situation, but the examples of companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) prove that refugee populations can be empowered to deliver economic benefits to themselves and the host country. With this context, here are the 20 most refugee-producing countries in the world whose displaced populations require continuous actions by businesses and host governments alike.  20 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World\n\n20 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile this list of the 20 most refugee-producing countries, we consulted the World Bank dataset on refugees by country of origin. The countries are listed in ascending order from least refugees to most, based on the total number of refugees the country had in 2022. Any refugee outflows during 2023 have not been accounted for in this dataset. Further insights have been added from recent UNHCR reports on refugees. Based on this methodology, here are the 20 most refugee-producing countries in the world:\n\n20 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World\n\n20. Cameroon\n\nNumber of Refugees: 147,359\n\nIn 2022, the UNHCR reported that while 30,800 Cameroonian refugees had managed to return to the country from Chad, 147,359 were still displaced. Most refugees are from the northwest and southwest regions of the country, where there’s an active conflict between the government and activist groups. Most Cameroonian refugees are hosted in Nigeria.\n\n19. Sri Lanka\n\nNumber of Refugees: 148,082\n\nMost Sri Lankan refugees reside in India after having fled from their country due to economic turmoils. With almost 150,000 refugees by 2022, Sri Lanka is one of the world’s most refugee-producing countries.\n\n18. Ethiopia\n\nNumber of Refugees: 149,245\n\nMillions of Ethiopian refugees have been forced to flee the country in the past few decades due to ongoing ethnic violence. The country itself is home to thousands of refugees from the surrounding countries of Eritrea, South Sudan, and Somalia, which puts the region in the middle of a complex refugee situation.\n\n17. China\n\nNumber of Refugees: 161,234\n\nMost of the displacement in China happened due to natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, and tropical storms. Economic sustainability is another reason thousands of people are fleeing the country to seek a better lifestyle. This is why China is one of the most refugee-producing countries in the world.\n\n16. Mali\n\nNumber of Refugees: 226,720\n\nThe UNHCR reports that in 2022, 28,500 Malian refugees, mainly in Mauritania and Burkina Faso, were recognized as refugees on a group basis. Violence and threats by armed groups are one of the main reasons why the Malian population has a considerable number of refugees.\n\n15. Venezuela\n\nNumber of Refugees: 234,376\n\nOf all the new asylum applications received in 2022, more than 2 in 5 were made by individuals from Latin America and the Caribbean, which included a high proportion of Venezuelans. Political turmoil and socio-economic instability are two of the main reasons why people are fleeing Venezuela.\n\n14. Rwanda\n\nNumber of Refugees: 249,685\n\nThe ethnic hostility that has been going on in Rwanda for decades is why it is still one of the most refugee-producing countries in the world, with a refugee population of 249,685 in 2022. Most Rwandan refugees remain scattered in neighboring countries, and only a small percentage has been able to return home.\n\n13. Iraq\n\nNumber of Refugees: 288,261\n\nAt least 36,000 Iraqi nationals filed asylum applications in 2022, which was the second-highest number in the Middle East and North Africa region after the Syrian Arab Republic. During the year, 2,600 Iraqis also received resettlement in Canada, which was one of the biggest resettler countries of the year.\n\n12. Burundi\n\nNumber of Refugees: 320,536\n\nIn 2022, 10,100 Burundian refugees had managed to return home from Uganda, but another 320,000 are still in refugee status. The contested elections and violence of 2015 are some of the main reasons why people have fled Burundi, making it one of the most refugee-producing countries in the world.\n\n11. Nigeria\n\nNumber of Refugees: 391,074\n\nIn 2022, 26,400 Nigerians applied for new asylum applications, with the country having produced a total of 391,074 refugees. Furthermore, 27,200 Nigerians, mainly hosted in Cameroon and Niger, received refugee recognition on a group basis. 10,700 Nigerian refugees also managed to return to the country from Niger.\n\n10. Eritrea\n\nNumber of Refugees: 508,291\n\nIn 2022, Eritrean refugees showcased a 27% increase in asylum applications, with applications being filed by 38,000 individuals. 6,100 Eritreans also received resettlement in Canada, whereas 4,700 received permanent residence or citizenship in their host countries. Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan are among some of the top countries hosting Eritrean refugees.\n\n9. Central African Republic\n\nNumber of Refugees: 748,327\n\nConflict and violence in various regions of the country are the reasons behind the huge refugee population from the Central African Republic. In 2022, 404,600 internally displaced people within the country managed to secure their return.\n\n8. Somalia\n\nNumber of Refugees: 790,513\n\nThe ongoing conflict, floods, and droughts are forcing Somalians to flee their country, even in 2023 and 2024. Climate change is one of the biggest reasons countries in the Horn of Africa continue to become hotter and drier, pushing more and more individuals into a state of insecurity.\n\n7. Sudan\n\nNumber of Refugees: 836,756\n\nThe conflict between armed groups in Sudan has placed the region in a state of dire insecurity. The country has millions of internally displaced individuals and thousands of its own refugees while also hosting refugees from other conflict-ridden countries in the region, such as South Sudan. This is why Sudan is one of the most refugee-producing countries in the world.\n\n6. Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nNumber of Refugees: 931,903\n\nAs insurgencies and conflict escalated in the North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces, millions of Congolese individuals had to be displaced inside and outside the country. This is why the Democratic Republic of Congo ranks sixth on our list of the world’s most refugee-producing countries.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Countries with Highest GDP per Capita by 2024 15 Fastest Declining States in the US 20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World\n\nDisclaimer: None. 20 Most Refugee-Producing Countries in the Worldis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

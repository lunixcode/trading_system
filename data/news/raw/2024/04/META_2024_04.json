        "title": "Judge dismisses Meta shareholder lawsuit claiming that directors' obligations extend beyond company",
        "content": "DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware judge on Tuesday dismissed a shareholder lawsuit asserting novel claims about the roles of corporate leaders and arguing that the loyalties of Meta directors and company founder Mark Zuckerberg should not lie exclusively with the social media giant.\n\nJames McRitchie, who runs a website focused on corporate governance and shareholder activism, argued that Meta’s directors have breached their duties to the company by putting profits over broader societal and economic interests, including Meta shareholders’ diversified investments in other companies.\n\nIn a 101-page opinion citing court rulings dating back more than 200 years, decades of law review articles and legal treatises, and even a Sherlock Holmes short story, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster rejected McRitchie’s claims.\n\nLaster noted that, under the “standard Delaware formulation” of corporate law, directors of a corporation owe duties to the stockholders as investors in that corporation.\n\n“The plaintiff has not made a persuasive case for change,” Laster wrote. “At most, he has shown that some academics — primarily from the law and economics school — have assumed that a diversified-investor model is the norm. He has also shown that some investor advocacy organizations would prefer that model.”\n\nWhile Delaware law requires corporate directors to act in the best interests of their stockholders, including maximizing the value of their shares, attorneys for McRitchie argued that Delaware courts should recognize a “portfolio theory” of corporate governance that takes into account external factors.\n\nThey argued, for example, that Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has prioritized profits while downplaying the detrimental effects of its products on society and the global economy. That, in turn, they said, can negatively affect the investment portfolios of Meta shareholders who also have invested in other companies.\n\nAmong the “negative externalities” the lawsuit blamed on Meta’s social media platforms are mental health problems among young Instagram users, online human trafficking, “vaccine hesitancy,” incitements to violence, and “election misinformation.”\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is not purposefully trying to crash the economy, but it might end up doing so anyway. Because out-of-hand government spending reignited inflation’s rise, the Fed is no longer eager to cut sky-high interest rates. It’s even being whispered the central bank could even raise rates again.\n\nThreading the needle between interest rates, politician-induced inflation and the economy is no easy task, and why central bankers are a problem for the average consumer. The whole enterprise can end up in a so-called hard landing with devastating results for families already hard-pressed to make ends meet.\n\nAlthough there’s no will in Washington to change the status quo, it doesn’t mean you need to accept things as they are. You need to protect your downside by finding stocks to buy for the coming market crash. Buying stocks that can weather the storm and grow with the eventual recovery is essential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s why the three stocks to buy below should be on your radar. They have been through multiple market corrections before and come out stronger. Add them to your portfolio today to boost your chances of coming through the other side of a crash in even better shape than you went in.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nMany investors might scratch their heads over recommending a real estate investment trust (REIT) as a stock to buy for a downturn, but Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is different. It is the world’s largest owner of data centers, with well over 300 properties in its portfolio. It counts Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and both AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) among its biggest customers.\n\nBusiness continues to move its data to the cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly critical component for ensuring the health and integrity of the information. The need for data centers won’t abate during a market crash. It would be just as important that data is accessible and viable — if not more so, particularly considering the caliber of Digital Realty’s clients.\n\nFounded in 2004, the data center REIT came through the financial crisis of the late 2000s just fine as well as after the global pandemic. And where the S&P 500 suffered a loss during the ensuing recession, the Digital Realty stock generated returns for investors.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend stocks will be an important component of surviving and thriving in a market crash, and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is an excellent dividend growth stock to buy. Because it is tied to the healthcare industry, it is a naturally recession-resistant business.\n\nStory continues\n\nHealth is not something people will skimp on simply due to being in a downturn. The number of people needing healthcare coverage only increases over time. For the past quarter century, UnitedHealth Group stock generated total returns of more than 8,500% versus 560% returns by the popular benchmark index. UNH has increased its dividend payment at a compounded annual growth rate of 20% over the past decade.\n\nThe insurer produced revenue of over $372 billion last year and forecasts it will grow sales at over 14% annually over the next few years. That’s the same rate Wall Street expects UNH to increase its earnings. Those are powerful numbers and show just how resilient UnitedHealth Group stock is through thick and thin.\n\nDomino’s (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of dividends, few stocks have been bigger dividend powerhouses than Domino’s (NYSE:DPZ). Its payout has grown by over 20% CAGR over the past decade while delivering total returns of 626%. More impressive, since its 2004 initial public offering (IPO), the pizza shop outpaced both the S&P 500 and UnitedHealth. It returned over 3,665% for investors versus 1,478% for UNH shareholders and 346% for index investors.\n\nThe power of compounding and interest will get you through many a tight spot. And there is good reason to think that will continue.\n\nAccording to data from Euromonitor and Morningstar, Domino’s has taken some 210 basis points of market share from the quick-serve pizza category since 2018. Its global share of sales now stands north of 20%.\n\nIt achieved this status through its strategy of fortressing or flooding a market with stores. While it can lower individual restaurant sales, total combined sales grow. It also improves profitability because it creates greater mindshare amongst consumers while reducing the costs of marketing. With other chains now adopting the strategy, DPZ stock is way out in front, and ordering a pizza will remain a relatively cheap, convenient fast-food option during a market crash.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Snap Finally Advances On The Ad Front\n\nLast Thursday, Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) reported its first quarter financials, showing that the improvements it made to its advertising system showed results faster than anticipated. Upon the earnings beat, strong revenue growth as well as the rise of daily active users to 422 million, shares surged 21% during after-hours trading.\n\nFirst quarter results show Snap’s efforts to rebuild its ad business are working.\n\nFor the first three months of the year, Snapchat-parent reported revenue rose 21% to $1.19 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $1.12 billion. More importantly, Snap finally reported double digit sales growth, after six consecutive quarters of single-digit growth and declines. Advertising brought in $1.11 billion to the revenue table, while Other Revenue grew 194% YoY to $87 million, fueled by more than 9 million Snapchat+ subscribers. As a result, adjusted EBITDA of $46 million surpassed expectations as StreetAccount expected a loss of $68 million. Adjusted EPS amounted to 3 cents, also greatly surpassing LSEG’s estimate of a 5 cents loss. Net loss narrowed to $305.1 million or 19 cent loss per share.\n\nSecond quarter guidance also surpassed estimates\n\nFor the current quarter, Snap guided for revenue in the between $1.23 billion and $1.26 billion, while StreetAccount expected $1.22 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA outlook is between $15 million and $45 million, also greatly surpassing Wall Street’s average expectation of $15.5 million.\n\nSocial media companies are benefiting from a stabilizing economy.\n\nLast week, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), surpassed both top and bottom line analyst estimates with its latest earnings report. However, Meta shares plunged due to a weak revenue guidance. For its first quarter, Meta reported its revenue rose 27% to $28.65 billion, which is its fastest growth rate since 2021, with net income more than doubling to $12.37 billion as besides the revenue acceleration, it did a great job in lowering sales and marketing costs by 16% YoY. Ad business, that makes most of Meta’s revenue, rose as much as 27% to $35.64 billion.However, Meta also increased its capital expenditures forecast due to ramping up AI investments. It guided for the 2024 capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion. Although Meta still hasn’t delivered its metaverse promise, its track record when it comes to social media and ads is as strong as it gets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Snap is still far behind Meta, both in terms of size and growth, they are facing similar challenges and after all, Snap is targeting a narrower niche of younger social media users. At the end of the day, Snap showed its business is improving faster than expected, providing hope that the Snapchat parent is finally on the right track to monetize its value proposition.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Amazon Results to Bring More Scrutiny for AI-Tethered Stocks",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s “show-me” moment will arrive on Tuesday when its earnings become the latest litmus test on appetite for heavy artificial intelligence spending.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Binance and CZ’s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Even in Jail Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System S&P 500 Falls 1% at End of Worst Month in 2024: Markets Wrap Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter\n\nThe message so far from investors: shares of firms that demonstrate progress in monetizing AI will be rewarded, while firms that don’t will see their stock price punished.\n\nLast week’s misfire by Meta Platforms Inc. triggered a roughly $400 billion selloff in tech stocks amid concerns about the benefits of heavy spending on artificial intelligence. Later results from Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. eased those fears.\n\nWhen Amazon reports, scrutiny will be on its web services segment, where it uses generative AI. Options traders are pricing in a move of nearly 8% in either direction for the stock a day after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“It’s all about AWS, how much they’re maintaining market share and then what they’re doing in AI to increase the bottom line,” said Paul Marino of GraniteShares.\n\n“Amazon has an incredibly steady retail business and that’s all great and they’re a dominant player — but none of that means anything if what they’re doing in the cloud, and what they’re going to do with AI, doesn’t bear fruit.”\n\nShares of Amazon fell as much as 1.4% on Tuesday, after advancing 4% over the previous two trading days.\n\nAmazon believes generative AI cloud services can generate billions in revenue in the coming years, and has invested heavily in the technology to ramp up.\n\nCrucial to how well its report is received is how Amazon communicates its outlook, with Meta’s slump last week partly coming down to what investors regarded as a lack of clarity. That’s key at a time when traders are rapidly reassessing whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.\n\n“They were not very clear about what the next couple of quarters look like, they were not very clear about what AI gains will mean to them in terms of profitability,” said Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., of Meta.\n\n“The focus is a little bit less right now, I think, on the near term results from the last quarter,” he added. “It’s more about what is your guidance looking like, knowing that interest rates are now going to be higher for longer.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Alphabet’s Cash Boom Is Raising Dividend Hopes on Wall Street\n\nThe last few megacap earnings reports have also put the return of capital to shareholders in focus. Google parent Alphabet’s share price jump last week was also driven by its announcement of a new dividend and additional $70 billion in buybacks in its earnings release.\n\nThat leaves Amazon as the final big tech company that doesn’t currently offer a dividend. Investors are awaiting a potential announcement, alongside a possible expansion of its buyback program.\n\nAmazon is well-liked by Wall Street, with no analyst sell recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average price target implies more than 17% upside from current levels.\n\nStill, if Amazon doesn’t meet expectations in the quarter or fails to give solid-enough commentary, Meta’s earnings rout offers an uncomfortable example of where investor sentiment currently lies.\n\n“It’s priced to perfection. It’s an unbelievable company, it’s a monopoly and very macro-related. I just think it’s over-owned,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\n\n“AWS has to see material acceleration,” or Amazon stock will be sold, Mortonson said.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nThe US push to ban TikTok marks a new phase in its approach to data security that could eventually impact everything from electric vehicles to health care, reshaping trade relations between the world’s biggest economies. Huawei Technologies Co.’s profit rose for the fourth consecutive quarter, a sign the Chinese tech company is taking market share from Apple Inc. and other smartphone rivals. Meta’s social media platforms Facebook and Instagram are under investigation from the European Union amid concerns they’re failing to cull targeted disinformation peddled by Russia that aims to sow discord on the continent. Samsung Electronics Co. topped analyst earnings estimates after its semiconductor division returned to profitability, as companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. led a surge in spending on artificial intelligence services. Microsoft Corp. will invest $1.7 billion to build out cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Indonesia, betting on Southeast Asia’s biggest economy to spur growth.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nPayPal Gartner Corning Zebra Tech CommVault IPG Photonics ACI Worldwide Postmarket\n\nAmazon AMD Super Micro Computer Pinterest Skyworks CCC Intelligent Solutions Littelfuse Blackbaud Mirion Technologies A10 Networks\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\n(Updates share move in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India’s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Here Are 3 Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "One of the pillars of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom is the semiconductor. And when it comes to high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), \"Magnificent Seven\" member Nvidia is at the forefront of the discussion. But even as demand is soaring for the company's A100 and H100 chips, smart investors realize that there are other opportunities alongside Nvidia.\n\nConsidering that stock is up 200% over the last year, it might be worth checking out the competition and looking for a better value. Let's dig into three of Nvidia's primary competitors and assess why each company could be a good buy right now.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIn early April, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) made waves with an announcement about its new AI chip, the Gaudi 3. According to Intel, the Gaudi 3 has 1.5 times faster training and inferencing power over Nvidia's H100. Moreover, the chip uses 40% less power than Nvidia GPUs, offering customers nice savings.\n\nAlthough Nvidia holds an estimated 80% share of the AI chip market, I'm cautiously optimistic that Intel can eat away at its rival's lead. Providers of IT architecture solutions -- including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and Super Micro Computer -- will all be designing systems that use the Gaudi 3. And Intel announced that early Gaudi 3 customers and partners include IBM and SAP.\n\nInvestors got a nice surprise during the company's first-quarter 2024 earnings report when CEO Pat Gelsinger said he now expects over $500 million in accelerated revenue in the second half of the year following the release of Gaudi 3.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is still the 800-pound gorilla in AI semiconductors, I see Intel's latest product release as an encouraging sign and am impressed by the initial success of Gaudi 3. With AI applications constantly evolving, I think Intel has a good chance to compete with Nvidia at a high level in the long run. Image Source: Getty Images\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nThe second company on my list is Nvidia's closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). As with Intel, Nvidia has a big lead on AMD. But this is not all good news for Nvidia, whose management has reminded investors that demand is outpacing supply, thereby creating a bottleneck for new business.\n\nThis is an opportunity for the competition to step in and take advantage. In late December, AMD announced its release of the MI300X accelerator. To date, this is the company's closest competing chip to what Nvidia offers.\n\nWhile it's still early, the MI300X launch has been encouraging so far. During the fourth quarter, the company's data center GPU business outperformed expectations by $400 million thanks to accelerated demand for the MI300X. Moreover, management believes that the addressable market for such chips will reach $400 billion by 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe combination of early success for the MI300X and an enormous market opportunity in data center GPUs gives AMD the opportunity to gain some momentum on Nvidia and become a more prominent player in the chip space over the long run.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nI'll admit that Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might look like the most unconventional company on my list. Indeed, today the company is largely an advertising leader thanks to its large Internet surface area covered by applications such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nHowever, as competition in social media heats up from TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and others, Meta is demonstrating that its impressive cash pile is being used for lucrative new opportunities. During the company's first-quarter earnings call, investors learned that management expects between $35 billion and $40 billion this year in capital expenditures. This is a noticeable increase from prior guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nThe reason behind the increased capex is Meta's efforts to build its own chips internally. The company's Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip could be a gold mine. First, a successful deployment of the MTIA would allow Meta to move away from its current infrastructure using Nvidia's H100 chips. This could lead to massive cost savings in the long run because the company would have its own customer chips and be less reliant on Nvidia over all.\n\nThe more subtle reason MTIA could unlock gains for Meta is that it provides a path for Meta to internalize as much of its tech stack as possible. The company is harvesting loads of data from its various social media platforms, so integrating its own chips into this workload could lead to more efficient operations as Meta seeks to continuously hone its targeted advertising capabilities.\n\nThe MTIA accelerator could be an enormous differentiator for Meta compared to peers, and I think it represents an entirely new source of growth for the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this social media company have returned -12% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.6%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.26 indicates a change of +15.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $38.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.2%. The $159.18 billion and $179.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and +13%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here Are My 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution is in full swing, as evidence by the strong results reported by several big tech giants last week. There is perhaps no stronger medium-term tailwind than AI spending and investment; however, for investors putting money to work today, many AI-related stocks have soared this year, pricing in a very strong future.\n\nSo which are the best AI stocks to buy now? Perhaps those companies likely to benefit from the AI revolution, but which have either pulled back or trailed higher-profile peers based on near-term concerns.\n\nThat makes these three storied tech stocks prime pickups this week for your new AI investment dollars.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) plunged following its recent earnings report, but let's keep things in perspective. The stock had rallied some 50% at one point earlier this year, so it needed an absolutely perfect report to go higher.\n\nInstead, there were some legitimate concerns. Though Meta beat Q1 estimates, management guided somewhat conservatively, for \"only\" 18% growth in the coming quarter, a deceleration from last quarter's booming 27% growth. While revenue guidance came in a tad light, CEO Mark Zuckerberg actually increased his forecast for capital investments in artificial intelligence (AI) this year.\n\nLighter-than-expected revenue and increased spending is certainly a recipe for a sell-off. But that's probably shortsighted. After all, there's a good reason the company is ramping up AI investments this year. Not only are current AI investments benefiting Meta's core social media platform recommendation engines today, but Meta also has the potential to be an AI leader outside of its current core businesses. After all, its Llama 3 large language model has become a best-in-class LLM, especially in the open source community.\n\nMark Zuckerberg said on the conference call with analysts:\n\nSo with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. So that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data, and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf AI is really going to transform the world, Meta is one of only a handful of companies with the financial resources and talent to lead it. And it looks as though Zuckerberg isn't shying away from the opportunity.\n\nHe also has credibility here. Meta was doubted in being able to transition to mobile, then Stories, then Reels. But each time, Meta's investments paid off and the company was able to adapt to monetize the new opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta trades at only 22 times this year's estimates and about 19 times 2025 earnings estimates. Not only is that not a demanding valuation, but it also incorporates tens of billions in losses in the company's Reality Labs segment, which are running at a $15 billion loss rate. Meanwhile, investors don't seem to be counting on any payoff for that investment at all.\n\nBasically, the post-earnings dip is a great long-term opportunity for what could be the leading consumer AI company in the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhile Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) should benefit handsomely from the AI revolution, its stock only just getting back to its highs from 2021.\n\nBut could a breakout be in the cards? Amazon has been thought of as a laggard in the AI races, and its cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is currently growing at the slowest pace its competitors.\n\nBut those concerns may be overblown. After all, AWS is the largest cloud platform, so it's more difficult for it to grow at high rates compared with its smaller competitors. Moreover, Amazon has flexed its scale during the past downturn, in which customers asked to control costs, by lowering prices in exchange for longer-term commitments. And since Amazon is ahead of the game designing its own in-house processors called Graviton and its AI accelerators called Trainium and Inferentia, it's able to direct customer workloads to those lower-cost options when appropriate. Buy these undervalued AI stocks today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMoreover, Amazon offers perhaps the most diverse set of large language models from third parties in its Amazon Bedrock service, along with its own in-house LLM called Titan. And while Amazon missed out on investing in OpenAI, Amazon made a strategic $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic back in March. It's very early in the AI races, and it's quite possible OpenAI won't dominate the space even though it's the biggest private AI startup today.\n\nBedrock also continues to improve. Just last week, Amazon rolled out several new features. These include allowing businesses to create their own custom models and use that model from the same API as popular third-party models, a model evaluation and comparison tool that helps customers select the right model for their specific needs, and two new Titan models, one optimized for image generation and another optimized for question-and answer chatbots.\n\nFinally, generative AI has the potential to greatly advantage any business with lots of proprietary data. As the world's largest e-commerce retailer, Amazon will very likely utilize AI to improve its core e-commerce and advertising businesses, along with new scientific ventures like the Kuiper satellite broadband project. Amazon has a history of inventing new products and services that are difficult to build, so AI is likely to also greatly aid the company's innovation engine.\n\nIntel\n\nFor a higher-risk but much higher-reward pick in the AI space, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) may be an intriguing choice. Unlike other AI chip companies that have boomed, Intel's stock has badly lagged. Having fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) several years ago on process technology, which all of Intel's competitors use as their foundry, has really hurt its cause.\n\nBut CEO Pat Gelsinger has seemingly righted the ship, as Intel's \"five nodes in four years\" road map seems to be on track, with Intel hitting its innovation timelines over the past year-plus.\n\nOf course, the ambitious technology investment is taking a toll on Intel's bottom line, as it not only invests heavily in leading process technology for its own processors, but also builds out capabilities for third-party chipmakers to use its foundry.\n\nAll of the uncertainty on execution and the multiyear plan has caused investors to flee to the sidelines for now. That's especially true as Intel's core market, the PC market, seems to be recovering slowly from its post-pandemic downturn. But that's why Intel stock today can be bought at just 1.3 times book value.\n\nYet if Intel executes, there's a chance it could make big inroads into the AI chip market. Management now forecasts over $500 million of revenue from its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator in the second half of this year, which Intel claims outdoes even Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 on certain workloads. Even better, Intel believes that 2025 will see it catch up to rivals on process technology in CPUs, when it releases the Xeon processor Clearwater Forest. Gelsinger believes that chip may be able to handle some key AI inferencing tasks that may be more cost-effective for CPUs to do than GPU accelerators. And 2025 should also see Intel's introduction of \"Falcon Shores,\" which actually combines Gaudi and Xeon technology into an AI superchip with the potential to rival Nvidia's Grace-Hopper or Grace-Blackwell superchips.\n\nWill Intel really overtake Nvidia in AI computing anytime soon? Probably not. But at its market cap at a just $135 billion versus Nvidia's market cap of $2.2 trillion, Intel only has to make some mild share inroads in AI for the stock to work.\n\nWhile an investment in Intel is riskier than other AI players, as it's highly execution-dependent, it also has much higher potential rewards, should the Gelsinger turnaround plan work out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story)\n\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Cathie Wood kicked off the new trading week looking to shake things up. The co-founder and CEO of Ark Invest added to 11 of her existing positions. She's had a rough start to 2024, but anyone who saw her breakthrough performance in 2020 knows that you never count Wood out.\n\nWood bought shares of Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) on Monday, building up some of her largest positions. Let's take a closer look at these three purchases.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nOne of last year's hottest stocks got off to a strong start through the first two months of 2024. Palantir was nearly a four-bagger in those 14 months, up a wealth-altering 291%. With shares of the software developer for the intelligence community moving lower for the second month in a row, Wood is a buyer.\n\nShe's not the only one who sees this as a potential buying opportunity. The once-bearish Monness Crespi upgraded Palantir on Friday, boosting its rating from sell to neutral. With Palantir a week away from announcing its first-quarter results, the timing of the upgrade is noteworthy. The company's execution and government contracts remain spotty, and the stock isn't cheap. But with the shares pulling back in recent weeks, Monness Crespi isn't comfortable going into Palantir's upcoming financial update with a bearish rating. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nExpectations are high for Palantir. Analysts see revenue rising 19% to $625.3 million for next week's first-quarter report. They also see Palantir's earnings per share soaring 60% to $0.08. Those are ambitious targets, but reality has been more than up to the task, as Palantir has posted double-digit percentage beats on the bottom line in three of the past four quarters.\n\nMomentum is on Palantir's side despite the recent downticks. After three years of decelerating top-line growth, Wall Street pros see the top line accelerating in 2024. Why? In part because after a long history of serving the the U.S. military and Western allies with its big data analytics, Palantir is gaining ground with private companies. U.S. commercial revenue rose 36% last year, more than double Palantir's overall growth in 2023. That's just a fifth of the revenue mix at Palantir, but it's a segment that could be at the heart of the accelerating revenue in 2024.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta is another stock that nearly tripled in 2023, roughly quadrupling in the 14 months through end of February before sliding March and April. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp saw its stock tumble 15% after posting mixed financial results last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first quarter itself was solid. Revenue growth accelerated 27% through the first three months of the year, up from a 22% increase in the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings also topped analyst profit targets. It was Meta's uninspiring guidance that tripped up the bullish narrative.\n\nThe sell-off seems like a dinner bell. Meta continues to be a master of monetizing social media platforms, and if rival TikTok is banned in the U.S., it will only drive that app's young user base to one of Meta's digital watering holes. The stock is also cheaper than you might think for a stock that's up 269% in the past 16 months. Meta is trading for a reasonable 23 times this year's projected earnings and 20 times next year's market forecast. Put another way, you could've bought Meta at the beginning of last year for just six times what it's likely to earn in 2024.\n\n3. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm isn't like Palantir and Meta. The patent-rich designer and provider of chips and software found in mobile devices, wireless networks, laptops, and other gadgetry didn't see its stock nearly triple or even double last year. It has struggled with growth lately, though its shares are trading nicely higher since the end of February. And unlike with Palantir and Meta, which are among Ark Invest's 18 largest collective holdings, Wood has a much smaller stake in Qualcomm.\n\nIt's also reporting fiscal second-quarter results later this week. Investors aren't holding out for much. The consensus estimate calls for a 6% decline in revenue and flattish bottom-line growth. Qualcomm has rattled off three quarters of accelerating bottom-line beats and a forward earnings multiple in the high teens, and it's close to revisiting the all-time highs it reached two years ago.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union said Tuesday that it's scrutinizing Facebook and Instagram over a range of suspected violations of the bloc's digital rulebook, including not doing enough to protect users from foreign disinformation ahead of EU-wide elections.\n\nThe EU's Executive Commission said it's opening formal proceedings into whether parent company Meta Platforms breached the Digital Services Act, a sweepting set of regulations designed to protect internet users and clean up social media platforms.\n\nBrussels has been cracking down on tech companies since the DSA took effect last year, opening investigations into social media sites TikTok and X, formerly known as Twitter, and ecommerce platform AliExpress. TikTok last week bowed to EU pressure last week and halted a reward feature on its new app after the Commission started demanding answerse about it.\n\n“We have a well established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.”\n\nThe Commission said it's looking into whether Meta is doing enough to curb the spread of “deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns and coordinated inauthentic behaviour” that could pose a risk to “electoral processes” and consumer protection.\n\nOfficials said it didn't appear that the company has an effective mechanism for content moderation, including for advertisments made with generative AI, including deepfakes - a shortcoming that they said appears to have been exploited by malicious actors for foreign interference.\n\nThe EU also suspects that Facebook and Instagram might be reducing the visibility in recommendation feeds of political content from accounts that pump out a lot of it - a practice known as shadowbanning - and not being transparent about it with users, which would be in violation of the DSA.\n\nA third concern is that Meta is phasing out the use of Crowdtangle, a tool used for real-time election-monitoring used by researchers, journalists and civil society. The Commission is giving Meta five days to respond with information on any “remedial measures” it's taking to make up for its loss.\n\nEU officials are taking measures to safeguard elections as citizens of the bloc's 27 nations prepare to vote for lawmakers in June.\n\nThe Commission is also investigating whether Meta's mechanism for users to flag illegal content is good enough under the DSA, because it suspects that method isn't easy to access and user-friendly.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Shhh! 3 Secret Virtual Reality Stocks Flying Below Wall Street’s Radar",
        "content": "Thanks to weaker-than-expected forecasts, top virtual reality (VR) stocks Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Unity Software (NYSE:U) are trading at discounts to 52-week highs despite the broad upswing in the stock market as the Federal Reserve prepares three rate cuts.\n\nAs for growth and inflation, Goldman Sachs forecasts that the U.S. GDP will grow by 1.8% from Q4 2023 to Q4 2024 and by 2.1% for the whole year. Once core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation goes below 2.5%, Goldman Sachs believes prices will drop dramatically.\n\nApart from these macroeconomic projections, by 2025, the world VR market is expected to be worth more than $22 billion, up from less than $12 billion in 2022, giving an added impetus to the trio we will explore.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite its long history as a tech giant, Microsoft’s broad business strategy makes virtual reality stable. Because of short-term sales predictions, the stock is cheap, making it a good option.\n\nMeta’s strong interest in virtual reality can be seen in the Meta Quest Pro, even though the company’s stock price has recently gone down because of low sales projections.\n\nUnity offers fantastic gaming tools, and its forthcoming improvements will make VR programs simpler.\n\nLet’s explore further!\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) microsoft stock\n\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft may seem odd among virtual reality stocks since it’s a legacy company. However, you should buy this stock because Microsoft’s diversification provide it an advantage over other VR stocks.\n\nMSFT stock is down owing to lower-than-expected quarterly revenue expectations as its AI aspirations ratchet up. However, it provides an attractive entry point and a potential upside of over 17%.\n\nMicrosoft is already an important player in VR. Microsoft Mesh is a tool for sharing mixed-reality experiences across different devices. It gained massive attention during the pandemic and continues to hold interest as more work shifts online.\n\n​Additionally, Microsoft has been keeping OpenXR Tools for Windows Mixed Reality up to date. Recent updates also improve motion reprojection techniques. These algorithms are very important for making virtual worlds smoother and more realistic.\n\nMicrosoft offers several resources for mixed reality (MR) developers. Developers may construct MR apps using tutorials, development kits and thorough documentation. MSFT also provides a video series for mixed reality novices that covers low-code/no-code platforms and sophisticated cloud services.​\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms is in much the same category as Microsoft. The reason for that is simple enough. Both these companies are legacy enterprises and Meta, with over 3 billion daily active users, possesses a huge consumer base to market its products.\n\nAnother thing that Meta Platforms and Microsoft have in common is that their stocks are both down because their guidance was not as good as expected. After Meta beat profit estimates for the first quarter, the company’s stock dropped 16%, the most in one day since October 2022, due primarily because of weak sales predictions.\n\nThat being said, the social media giant is still working hard on its VR plans. Case in point, Meta Quest Pro is high-end VR gear with advanced features like flat lenses, high-resolution cameras that face outward and inward-facing sensors to record feelings and track eye movement.\n\nReports say that Meta will release four new VR headsets by 2024. These will include Project Cambria and two cheaper ones called Stinson and Cardiff. Furthermore, Meta has lowered the prices of its Quest 2 models and tools to get more people to use VR technologies.\n\nAll of these initiatives illustrate Meta Platforms’ forward-thinking approach, which is further reflected by its 24% upside potential and ‘Strong Buy’ rating.\n\nUnity Software (U) A developer works on a 3D racing game in the Unity engine on a laptop.\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike with MSFT and META, Unity is suffering from similar themes. The game software company’s stock dropped by double digits after management issued tepid financial forecasts and unveiled its restructuring strategy.\n\nHowever, experts say Unity Software has good promise, just like the other two virtual reality stocks on this list. Unity holds a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, with an upside potential of 33%.\n\nOn VR developments, when Unity 6 game engine comes out in 2024, it will speed up VR and other real-time 3D apps. This update makes it faster to make shared games, works with WebGPUs right away and supports more XR devices.\n\nUnity also now fully supports the brand new Meta Quest 3 headset. This makes it easy for developers to create mixed-reality apps that can be used on more than one device. In projects like making digital twins for businesses like aviation, Unity has been praised for the unique ways it uses VR and AR.\n\nUnity is undoubtedly a company in transition. As it changes how much it spends, Unity thinks its adjusted EBITDA margin will go from 20% in 2023 to “over 25%” in 2024. If the company makes good on its promises, there is a substantial 33% upside on offer.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOptimism about the potential of AI to transform the tech industry has resulted in a dash to increase investment. Look no further than the income statement of Nvidia (NVDA) for signs of how frenetic this pace has been.\n\nThe share prices of the market's biggest tech companies making these investments also reveal that investors have been generally receptive to the idea.\n\nAnd how management teams have gotten investors on board with the idea that spending billions against AI opportunities that might still be elusive is simple: They're also getting paid.\n\nTake Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), for example.\n\nIn 2023, the company spent a little over $32 billion on capital expenditures, which they define in their annual report as spending that \"primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure.\" In 2022, capex spending totaled $31.5 billion.\n\nGenerally, this is money spent on chips, servers, and raw computing power to run what we experience as the company's suite of services — Search, YouTube, Gmail, and so on.\n\nAs AI overwhelmed any other strategic investment Alphabet may have contemplated for itself, this spending ramped considerably.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company's capex spending hit $12 billion. On a call with investors last week, CFO Ruth Porat said, \"We expect quarterly capex throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level.\"\n\nPorat cautioned that this spending can be lumpy. But that annualized rate of spending — $48 billion — is about 50% higher than what the company spent in each of the last two years.\n\nTo get investors on board with this approach, the company is offering a bounty. Ruth Porat, CFO, Alphabet and Google, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 2, 2022, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nAlphabet initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, the first regular dividend in the company's history. Its share buyback authorization was also increased by $70 billion, in addition to the $20 billion available under its existing program.\n\nAt its current share count, this dividend will cost Alphabet a little less than $10 billion per year in cash, paid out to shareholders. In the first quarter, Alphabet repurchased $16.1 billion worth of its own stock.\n\nIncreasing share buybacks will bring the cash-out spending on dividends down a smidge as repurchased shares are retired, but if the company roughly keeps up its current pace of repurchases, then quarterly shareholder returns should fall somewhere between $18 billion and $19 billion. On an annual basis, these figures should run closer to $75 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Alphabet's annual capex spending set to rise by at least $16 billion in 2024, investors are more than making up for it.\n\nNow, as Meta (META) learned last week, this support can be fickle.\n\nIts stock fell more than 10% after raising its forecast for spending this year, a move that came just three months after investors cheered Meta for the same initiative Alphabet announced last week — instating a dividend and increasing its buyback authorization.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors the company's first quarter results indicated the company \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest-scale AI services in the world.\"\n\n\"But realistically,\" he added, \"even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\n\nAt least in the interim, investors will get paid for the privilege of waiting. A perhaps unexpected benefit from the AI boom.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com may be feeling pressure to join the dividend club",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram have failed to tackle deceptive advertising and disinformation ahead of key European Parliament elections, the European Commission said on Tuesday as it opened an investigation into suspected breaches of EU online content rules.\n\nThe move by EU tech regulators came amid concerns about Russia, China and Iran as potential sources of disinformation, but also inside the EU, with some political parties and organisations seeking to attract voters with lies in the June 6-9 vote to select the next five-year parliament.\n\nThe Digital Services Act which kicked in last year requires Big Tech to do more to counter illegal and harmful content on their platforms.\n\n\"We suspect that Meta's moderation is insufficient, that it lacks transparency of advertisements and content moderation procedures,\" EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"So today, we have opened proceedings against Meta to assess their compliance with the Digital Services Act,\" she said.\n\nThe Commission said it suspects that Meta does not comply with DSA obligations related to addressing the dissemination of deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns and coordinated inauthentic behaviour in the EU.\n\nIt also singled out the non-availability of an effective third-party realtime civic discourse and election-monitoring tool ahead of the elections to the European Parliament.\n\nThe Commission also cited concerns about Meta's deprecation of its disinformation tracking CrowdTangle without an adequate replacement.\n\nMeta has five working days to inform the EU about remedial actions taken to address the concerns. DSA breaches can cost companies fines of as much 6% of their global annual turnover. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Following a volatile start to the decade, the bulls are, once again, running wild on Wall Street. Despite a modest pullback, investors have witnessed the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite jump to record-closing highs within the last five weeks.\n\nWhile there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors since this new bull market took shape, the Magnificent Seven have done the lion's share of the heavy lifting. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are long-term outperformers with well-defined competitive advantages\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of Wall Street's largest and most-influential businesses. Listed in descending order by market cap, as of the closing bell on April 26, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nAside from all seven of these companies crushing the S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, their lure, from an investment standpoint, is their competitive advantages and/or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging the old with the new. Windows is still the world's leading operating system for desktops, while Azure is the global No. 2 cloud-infrastructure service platform. Apple's calling card to success has long been its iPhone, which accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to make up in the neighborhood of 90% of the GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet's Google comprised more than 91% of global internet-search share in March, while streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world. Amazon's online marketplace is No. 1 in the U.S., with an estimated 37.6% of domestic online retail share in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud-infrastructure service platform. Meta Platforms owns the top social media sites globally, including Facebook, which attract more than 3.2 billion daily active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nBut there's a new draw to the Magnificent Seven that didn't exist when 2024 began: Most of these companies now pay a dividend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay a regular dividend to their shareholders\n\nWhen most investors think of the Magnificent Seven, they probably envision Wall Street's steadiest growth stocks. With these businesses aggressively reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth segments and innovations, collecting dividend income is likely an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, operating cash flow has been so robust for most of these companies that paying a regular dividend can be done without hampering their innovative capacity in any way.\n\nEntering 2024, three Magnificent Seven constituents had been paying a dividend to their shareholders for years.\n\nMicrosoft has been paying a continuous quarterly dividend since September 2004 and has seen its payout grow by more than 800% since its dividend program was first initiated. Apple reinstated its quarterly-dividend program in the summer of 2012 and has increased its payout by 154% in under 12 years. Nvidia has paid what currently amounts to a token dividend ($0.04 per quarter) dating back to the summer of 2013.\n\nIn February, Meta Platforms joined the party when its board introduced a $0.50 per-quarter distribution. Even with aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality devices, and the metaverse, Meta closed out the March quarter with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated over $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations during the quarter. It has the balance sheet and capital to support a continuous payout to its shareholders.\n\nLast week, Alphabet became the newest member of the club. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and now-profitable cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, initiated a $0.20 per-quarter dividend. Alphabet ended March with over $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated an astounding $28.8 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of the new year. It can easily absorb this annual payout while fueling its cloud and AI-driven ambitions.\n\nLater today, Tuesday, April 30, a sixth member of the Magnificent Seven has an opportunity to join the club.\n\nIs this the newest dividend-paying Magnificent Seven stock?\n\nLast week, Tesla's operating results made it plainly evident that it won't be doling out a dividend anytime soon to its shareholders. Tesla endured a free-cash outflow of $2.53 billion during the first quarter, with EV competition heating up and multiple rounds of price cuts wrecking the company's operating margin. Selling a commoditized product in a cyclical industry might make it difficult for Tesla to ever pay a dividend.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven component that could become the newest dividend paying stock in mere hours is Amazon -- the company is slated to report its first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today.\n\nWith Amazon stock trading at a multiple of 62 times trailing-12-month earnings, you might be quick to dismiss the likelihood of the company doling out a dividend to its shareholders. However, Amazon's balance sheet, and its three ancillary operating segments that are bona fide cash machines, suggest it can become the next income stock.\n\nWhen the curtain closed on 2023, Amazon was sitting on a treasure chest of nearly $86.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. More importantly, net cash provided by operating activities soared to nearly $85 billion in 2023 from $46.8 billion in the previous year. By 2027, Amazon's three higher-margin ancillary segments -- AWS, advertising services, and subscription services -- are expected to more than double the company's 2023 operating cash flow.\n\nAlthough advertising can be cyclical, Amazon's operating cash flow is fairly insulated against downturns in the U.S. and global economy. While e-commerce generates most of its revenue, the online marketplace is a low-margin segment. The predictability of subscription-services revenue, coupled with enterprise cloud spending still being early in its ramp, all but ensures that Amazon will have more capital than it'll know what to do with.\n\nDon't overlook peer pressure as a catalyst, either. With Meta and Alphabet introducing a dividend over the last three months, Amazon may have little choice but to follow suit in order to maintain its seat at the table among America's most-influential businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Although revenue and earnings were actually down year over year, the company added 350,000 more net additions to its wireless business. It shows Ma Bell’s decision to spin off its Warner Media business into Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) so it could narrowly focus on its telecom operations is paying off.\n\nMany investors at the time were dismayed AT&T slashed its dividend in half, yet the payout of $1.11 per share still yields a lucrative 6.7% annually. And now that the telecom’s finances are much more stable, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see AT&T begin raising its dividend again this year.\n\nThe company generated a whopping $3.1 billion in free cash flow (FCF) this quarter, far outrunning Wall Street’s expectations of just $2.4 billion. It shows just how much the growth AT&T is witnessing in its consumer and wireless segments is generating excess cash flows. FCF is important for companies and investors because that’s how they pay for their dividends after all the bills are paid.\n\nAt just 8 times trailing earnings and next year’s estimates, as well as a bargain-basement 5x the FCF it produced, AT&T stock is a deeply discounted bargain you won’t regret buying today.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe selloff in Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) stock following its own earnings report was absurd and an opportunity to buy in now. The Facebook owner handily beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line while enjoying a massive increase in ad spending. Yet the stock plunged nearly 11% in the aftermath.\n\nWe get it. Investors were spooked by guidance that suggested slow earnings expansion going forward as it invests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). They haven’t forgotten Meta’s all-in bet on the metaverse. The billions of dollars Reality Labs has cost Meta is no joke. It said its investments in the project lowered last year’s operating profit by $16.1 billion. Yowser. Now it wants to spend big on AI.\n\nThere’s a difference, though. Artificial intelligence is the real deal compared to whatever it was the metaverse was supposed to become. Companies are seeing real-world results from the technology that will only expand exponentially as its capabilities are enhanced. Meta is smart to be going big here. Who knows? Maybe it will even pay benefits one day in the metaverse.\n\nIn the meantime, you won’t regret buying Meta Platforms stock. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp continue to be resilient and the 27% surge in ad revenue to $35.6 billion shows advertisers know where to turn to reach consumers. META stock will be an even bigger deal down the line.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock is kind of a big deal today. It’s going to get much bigger in the future. Demand for fossil fuels shows no signs of letting up, and in fact is increasing.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration just hiked its assessment of global oil consumption. It raised the 2022 baseline figure by 0.8 million barrels per day, which now has it increasing its consumption forecasts for this year and next by 0.4 million and 0.5 million per day, respectively. It also estimates oil prices will average $90 per barrel, a $2 per barrel increase over its previous estimate.\n\nThe energy stock’s growth plans are based on oil at $60 per barrel. Anything above that is gravy that can be returned to shareholders through dividends, stock buybacks, acquisitions and more. It recently announced it was buying Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), which it says will drive its break-even costs below $35 a barrel. It may even get access to Hess‘ (NYSE:HES) rich Guyana assets. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) wants to buy the oil company but Exxon says it has the right of first refusal on any acquisition. It already has lucrative Guyanese oil fields of its own and Hes’s fields would be a jewel it could add to its crown.\n\nExxon stock has doubled over the past three years and could readily double again going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T, WBD, XOM and CVX stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

        "title": "7 Diamond-in-the-Rough Stocks Worth Digging Up Now",
        "content": "“Undervalued stocks” is a relative term — for some, it may mean a tech stock in a temporary dip; for others, it means deep value stock analysis involving obscure and esoteric multiples and calculations.\n\nThese companies blend the best of undervalued stock objectives. While some are less-than-profitable and may not be a value stock by most parameters, each has sufficient market strength and imminent tailwinds to propel higher per-share pricing. We’re rapidly entering an era where high-flying tech stocks relying on promises of AI and the like will stop being cash magnets — look to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) price action for proof.\n\nAs an alternative, these stocks will likely start seeing increased investor cash inflows as mega-caps begin drying up and traders fight for diversification from a heavily concentrated market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX) Two electric vehicles facing a dark sky, sunset background with one EV hooked up to an EV charger in between the two cars. EV Stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Larich\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) is a double threat when it comes to undervalued stocks: trading at low multiples (including just 8x earnings and 0.5x sales), the company also exists as an overlooked player in its wider industry: green tech and sustainable driving. The industrial manufacturer makes various automotive parts and add-ons for emission reduction and zero-emission tech, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel autos.\n\nAs pure-EV plays struggle amid waning consumer interest, as evidenced by skyrocketing hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales compared to electric counterparts, Garrett Motion stock acts as an intermediary for investors interested in long-term sustainability but aware that global EV adoption is a decades-long pipe dream at this point.\n\nRecent stock suppression came from a fair-to-middling earnings report last week that included a 6% quarterly sales slippage, though annual sales stayed steady, and the company’s margins and free cash flow remained healthy. Ultimately, this undervalued stock is a victim of investors looking for the next high-flying growth opportunity. However, as wider economic forces kick the legs from under mega-caps currently controlling the market’s direction, small-cap value stocks like Garrett Motion are expected to become hot commodities.\n\nSturm Ruger & Company (RGR) An LCP Custom handgun manufactured by Sturm Ruger (RGR).\n\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nSturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) is one of those critically undervalued stocks that, with just a hint of good news from its May 7th earnings report, could trigger a buying frenzy that elevates the company well past its current position. That position is a testament to its critically undervalued stock status, a 14.5x price-to-earnings ratio, and an equally slim 1.5x sales ratio. Both may seem reasonable, but when considering the company’s fall from grace after a downbeat November 2023 earnings report it hasn’t yet recovered from, it seems only a matter of time until Ruger reasserts itself on top of the wider firearm stock sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, income investors can find something to love about Ruger’s stock as management steadfastly sticks to distributing 40% of its net income as dividends; this approach means that quarterly dividend amount may vary but also serves as a smart way for Ruger to ensure shareholder value remains high while keeping enough cash on hand for expansion and initiatives. That payout ratio equates to a respectable 2.32% dividend yield today, which jumps further to 3.78% when accounting for stock buybacks.\n\nCostamare (CMRE) Costamare Inc. website zoomed in on the logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven as seafaring shipping concerns put competitor transport stocks at risk, containership chartering company Costamare (NYSE:CMRE) remains robust despite its status among undervalued stocks, trading at just 0.6x book value and 5.6x earnings. Unfortunately, for investors, waiting for Costamare to pop demands patience since, though global freight and charter prices spiked in early 2024, Costamare’s non-operating owner status means that its fleet is more than 87% booked for the remainder of the year and likely at less-than-ideal pricing.\n\nStill, recognizing which way the winds are blowing, Costamare’s management is rapidly right-sizing operations and divesting smaller ships within the fleet while snatching up larger vessels to maximize cost efficiency as geopolitics make naval transport increasingly unpredictable.\n\nI’ll be honest – Costamare is a strong buy at these levels, but investors should expect upward momentum to take some time to build before the stock sets sail again. In the meantime, Costamare’s healthy 7% total yield (roughly split between buybacks and distributions) should be enough to keep shareholders happy in the short term.\n\nSharkninja (SN) Coins for Undervalued Value Stocks\n\nSource: Via iStock\n\nWide-ranging appliance manufacturer Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) stands out as one of today’s most undervalued stocks in the consumer sector despite receiving little attention from investors. Since its debut in last year’s challenging summer market, Sharkninja stock has proved nearly unbeatable. Its shares soared 130% higher post-listing in less than a year, massively outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nBut it’s not just Sharkninja’s short-term strength and resilience that make it stand out; the company’s solid operational fundamentals position it for significant growth in the coming years. as evidenced by its 20% annual sales increase since 2008, with no signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestors interested in snagging a piece of Sharkninja stock should do so before the company’s May 9th earnings report; muted annual guidance following the company’s fourth-quarter report included fairly flat sales for the first few quarters of 2024 – so even a modest revenue bump could send shares surging.\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) remain at the forefront of the market. Yet, undervalued stock Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) is quickly becoming a notable contender among big-name beverage stocks. Unlike the highly competitive energy and standard sports drink markets, Vita Coco dominates the coconut water segment, commanding over half the market share.\n\nTo expand its purview, Vita Coco strategically partnered with British alcohol giant Diageo (NYSE:DEO) to venture into the rapidly expanding ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage sector, introducing a line of spiked coconut water options. While coconut water blended with Captain Morgan isn’t my bag personally, analysts forecast that the burgeoning market will hit 7.5% compound annual growth rate targets through 2029, positioning Vita Coco to secure a significant portion of this growth.\n\nFinancially, Vita Coco recently blew expectations away with a year-end earnings beat of 4%, driven by an impressive nearly 500% increase in net income and a profit margin of 9.4%. Investors upset about missing Monster’s stock mega-run may have a chance to redeem themselves with this undervalued stock.\n\nSteelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHigh-end home office and corporate furniture manufacturer Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) stands out as a promising undervalued value stock, but like others listed, it generally escapes retail traders’ attention. Steelcase has successfully adapted to the evolving work-from-home trends in the post-pandemic era. Its recent $0.10 quarterly dividend announcement translates to a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.\n\nThe company has swiftly recovered its financial footing after the pandemic’s challenges. Its latest quarterly earnings report showed a net income of $30.8 million, more than doubling the figure from the previous year. Moreover, Steelcase has consistently maintained sales of around $800 million over the past five quarters, indicating effective margin improvements without compromising quality.\n\nIn response to the ongoing shift towards remote work, Steelcase is strategically aiming for 5-7% annual sales growth and a target of 5% free cash flow margin relative to revenue over the next five years. Additionally, the company has significantly reduced its debt to adapt to the higher interest rate environment, thereby enhancing liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. These strategic moves position Steelcase as one of the top undervalued stocks within the lagging remote work stock segment.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) occupies a unique position at the nexus of semiconductor and undervalued stocks, offering an appealing combination in a sector where many options are becoming increasingly expensive. This semiconductor company specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a critical but niche area within the semiconductor industry with significant implications for the future.\n\nThe photomasks from Photronics enhance the precision and accuracy necessary for microchip patterning, propelling advancements in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. These fields demand increasingly complex and precise circuitry, and Photronics’ photomasks likewise contribute to the wider industry’s miniaturization of transistors and components. With its shares trading at a slim 12x price-to-earnings ratio and offering a blend of compelling value propositions, Photronics stands out as a prime candidate among a shrinking pool of undervalued stocks in the semiconductor sector, perfectly positioned at an intersection of current and emerging technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Woes Are Your Windfall: 3 AI Stocks to Grab Now",
        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia’s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock’s foundation’s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment’s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker’s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm’s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta’s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world’s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML’s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AMD to report Q1 earnings Tuesday as Wall Street looks for jump in AI and PC sales",
        "content": "Chip giant AMD (AMD) will report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. The announcement follows rival Intel’s disappointing report last week. While Intel (INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines, the company provided lower than anticipated revenue guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding.\n\nInvestors and analysts will be looking at two key metrics during AMD’s report: AI chip sales and PC market performance. The company released its MI300 line of AI accelerators in Dec. 2023 and began shipping units shortly thereafter. How well those chips are selling could have a large impact on AMD’s shares following the earnings announcement.\n\nWall Street expects earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That would mark a slight increase from the same quarter last year when AMD reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion.\n\nAMD’s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s (NVDA) best-selling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia’s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia’s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators. Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CMO, AMD speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel on September 26, 2023 in Dana Point, California. (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox Media) (Jerod Harris via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia, however, announced its follow up to the H100 in the form of its Blackwell platform during its GTC conference in March, which should offer better performance than its predecessor.\n\nThe AI arms race isn’t slowing anytime soon, either. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) each announced that they’re pouring money into AI data center capabilities to build out and support their various software offerings.\n\nBut whether AMD can steal significant market share away from market leader Nvidia remains to be seen. According to UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri, MI300X sales should bring in billions this year.\n\n“We still very much see $5 billion to $6 billion as still conservative for MI300 revenue this year and we also see guidance being fine,” he wrote in an investor note ahead of earnings.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is anticipating Data Center revenue of $2.31 billion, which would equate to a year-over-year increase of 78% versus the same period last year.\n\nOutside of AI sales, Wall Street will be looking at the recovery in the PC market and its impact on AMD’s sales. According to IDC, global PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter of 2024, marking the first quarter of growth after two years of declines.\n\nIntel already reported a 31% year-over-year bump in Client Group revenue, the company’s PC chip segment, in its latest quarter. That should bode well for AMD. Both companies are pushing their own AI PCs, or laptops and desktops that can run generative AI apps locally rather than via the web.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are calling for AMD Client revenue, the segment that includes PC chip sales, to jump 74% year-over-year to $1.29 billion in the quarter.\n\nBut Intel and AMD aren’t the only companies pushing for a slice of the AI PC market. Qualcomm (QCOM) is angling for its own cut with its new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips for laptop.\n\nDespite healthy growth projections for its Data Center and Client segments, Wall Street is expecting the company’s Gaming and Embedded divisions to tumble 45% and 40%, respectively.

        "title": "3 Underrated Tech Titans to Buy for Explosive Growth in 2024",
        "content": "As we near the second half of 2024, the correction phase points to a powerful upside potential in underrated tech stocks.\n\nLast year witnessed an extraordinary boom in technology stocks, soaring to uncharted heights. However, the recent warning signs are becoming too loud to ignore, as evidenced by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has slid 2.5% in the past month. This shift in momentum has made investors revamp their investment choices.\n\nDuring this tumultuous transformation, technology behemoths like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost over $750 billion from their respective market capitalizations, exposing the tech sector’s vulnerability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis turbulence has exposed the shortcomings in the major tech stocks while simultaneously revealing untapped potential in the broader market. While investors and the media tend to focus mostly on mega-cap stocks, many underrated businesses are quietly making significant strides. Thus, it is pertinent to identify diamonds in the rough and bet on these three tech stocks for spectacular gains.\n\nUnderrated Tech Stocks: Photronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) shines brightly within the technology industry’s semiconductor equipment and materials niche. Its mastery of photomask manufacturing has led to a mind-boggling 99% year-over-year (YOY) price growth.\n\nIt’s not just the price, though. Photronics maintained resilience, posting a revenue of $216.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, which marks a 2% bump year-over-year. Seasonal fluctuations and a shorter Q1 caused sequential revenue to decline, but annual growth depicts Photronics’ ongoing capacity to increase revenues.\n\nMoreover, Photronics’ top-line growth is greatly driven by its stronghold in advanced technology nodes, such as 22 nm and 28 nm, within the integrated circuit (IC) segment. Customers are moving toward these nodes to maximize savings and improve performance, driving up demand for Photronics’ photomask solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Photronics’ non-GAAP earnings multiple for the trailing year trades at 13.28x, substantially less than the industry average of 21.64x. In contrast to being a valued catch, this distinguishes the continued relevance of photomasks in escalating technological experiences.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a leader in memory and storage solutions, is enhancing its role in the tech sector. It’s ramping up mass production of high bandwidth memory chips that power Nvidia’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips. As Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra boasted at the recent conference: “Our HBM3E product will be a part of Nvidia’s H200 Tensor Core GPUs, and we are progressing on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with Micron’s collaboration with Nvidia, its comeback story is grabbing headlines. Investors can rejoice in the company’s much-anticipated return to profitability. Following five consecutive quarters of negative earnings per share (EPS), Micron posted positive non-GAAP EPS of 42 cents in Q2 2024, exceeding expectations by 66 cents. Moreover, Micron is performing impressively with reported revenue of $5.82 billion, marking a significant 58% YOY upswing from $3.69 billion and surpassing estimates by $473.44 million.\n\nThis sustained trajectory has earned Micron a ‘strong buy’ rating from TipRanks analysts, who predict a robust 10% upside potential, further solidifying Micron’s standing in the tech sector.\n\nUnderrated Tech Stocks: Applied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has excelled as a linchpin in microchip manufacturing equipment. AMAT benefits from this significant advancement as AI applications depend increasingly on sophisticated CPUs. As a result, the company’s stock has taken off, climbing by 25% in 2024 alone. Spread these gains over the past year, and you see an astounding 84.37% bump compared to the S&P 500’s 25.74%. This result reflects the high demand for its cutting-edge equipment, which is essential for creating advanced semiconductors that form the basis of AI technology.\n\nBuilding on this upbeat trajectory, AMAT reported EPS of $2.12 in Q4 2023, topping analyst expectations by 22 cents. Additionally, the business reported revenue of $6.71 billion, outperforming the projected $6.48 billion. This economic stability is further supported by a stellar 46.41% return on common equity for the trailing year, a sign of profitability and efficient capital use.\n\nMoreover, AMAT enhances shareholder value by sweetening the pot with a dividend that has grown for six consecutive years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk.\n\nThe rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand.\n\n2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024\n\nmichael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of.\n\nFor these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 most promising stocks to buy before they take off. To skip the detailed analysis of the current earnings week, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off.\n\nMeta Grows Revenue by 27% in Q1, Provides Weak Outlook for FY '24\n\nThe market started the week on a positive note, showing an upward trajectory on April 22 and 23. However, there was a slight temporary dip in the market, especially for tech stocks after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided a disappointing outlook despite better-than-expected earnings. On April 24, the company reported Q1 2024 GAAP EPS of $4.71, ahead of consensus estimates by $0.39, and the revenue of $36.46 billion was up over 27% year-over-year and outperformed the forecasts by $240 million.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) provided weak outlook, showing increased expenses for the year and revenue expectations for the second quarter below analyst estimates. The company anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures to be between $35-40 billion, up from the prior guidance of $30-37 billion, and expects revenue of $36.5-39 billion in the second quarter. In addition, Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) metaverse division, Reality Labs continues to lose cash and reported losses of $3.85 billion on a $440 million revenue.\n\nNevertheless, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) mentioned some positives too about its AI offerings at its latest earnings call. The CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said:\n\n“We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs, and a lot more.\n\nLast week we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and usage.\n\nThe initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and, when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are.”\n\nPerformance Spotlight: Cyclical Stocks Excel\n\nAs we mentioned in our earlier article, the performance of cyclical stocks is directly proportional to the market conditions (check out undervalued cyclical stocks). The recent performance of stocks such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) might show some optimism around the market. On April 24, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.53, outperforming the consensus estimates by $0.11 and revenues showed an increase of 12.2% at $2.57 billion, beating the forecasts by $40 million. The company also gave its outlook for the second quarter of 2024 and the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q2 2024, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) expects system-wide comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) to increase by 2% to 4% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, the system-wide comparable RevPAR is also set to increase by 2% to 4%, and net income is expected to be between $1.586 billion and $1.621 billion. Furthermore, the company expects adjusted EBITDA of $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, up from its previous record of $3.1 billion in 2023. Finally, the company’s capital returns are expected to be $3 billion. At its latest earnings call, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE:HLT) CEO, Chris Nassetta made the following comments:\n\n“In the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia-Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history.\n\nSystem-wide construction starts also outperformed expectations, up roughly 45% versus last year, with all major regions meaningfully higher. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly 4x our share of existing supply.”\n\nFord Adapts: Mitigating EV Losses\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) outperformed earnings estimates and provided a strong outlook for the rest of the year. On April 24, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) reported a non-GAAP EPS of $0.49 vs $0.42 estimates, and revenues of $42.78 billion were up 3.2% year-over-year, outperforming market estimates by $1.31 billion. The company’s EBIT outlook remained the same and is expected at the high end of the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) raised its adjusted free cash flow (FCF) outlook to the range of $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion from the prior guidance range of $6 billion and $7 billion. On top of that, the company decreased its capital expenditures outlook from $8 billion to $9.5 billion to a lower range of $8 billion to $9 billion. Ford Motor Company’s (NYSE:F) president and CEO, Jim Farley made the following comments during the latest earnings call:\n\n“I wanted to highlight four key strategic areas: how our growth drivers are changing, our progress in quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in Quarter 1. On growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix and having good news on pricing.\n\nWhat's changed in the last year and especially in Q1, you could see, is our top-line and bottom-line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix, and we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. And that new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the No.\n\n1 best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world. And our Ford Transit cargo van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. And our midsized Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is the third best-selling vehicle at Ford and together with the Everest makes up our profits outside of China, North America and Europe.”\n\nSeeing the strong performance of cyclicals could be a sign of a strong economy ahead, and in such cases, investors could look toward stocks that have experienced a pullback and have significant upside to them.

The company has been on a roller coast since the approval of Aduhelm, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, in June 2021. At the time, the approval was highly criticized given the limited efficacy of the treatment. Following the fallout, the company stands today with a new highly regarded CEO, Christopher Viehbacher, a more efficacious approved Alzheimer’s treatment in Leqembi, a rationalized cost structure and a more disciplined investment approach. While the uptake in Leqembi has been slow, we still see strong long-term potential for a patient population that is dramatically underserved. We believe you are getting the opportunity to buy a high performing health care asset, with a strong track record of delivering superior products all while only paying for the current value of their assets on the market today. At the current valuation, we think you are getting a call option on the pipeline and the Leqembi roll-out. It is not often that you see this sort of risk/reward skew in the market, and we opportunistically took advantage.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Promising Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n25 Safest and Cheapest Cities To Retire in Florida 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\nDisclosure.

On January 24, Variety reported that as per Omdia’s senior research director María Rua Aguete, the media and entertainment industry is expected to surpass a $1 trillion valuation in 2024. The trillion-dollar mark is driven by diverse segments, with online video projected to be valued at $345 billion, games at $255 billion, music at $44 billion, and cinema at $41 billion. These segments from the media and entertainment industry will significantly contribute to the industry’s growth.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdowns, the media and entertainment industry saw a rise. However, things started to change post-pandemic. The global entertainment and media revenue increased by only 5.4% in 2022 compared to a growth of 10.6% in 2021. According to a report by PwC, the revenue of the global entertainment and media industry is set to decline sequentially in the next five years. The revenue for 2027 is expected to grow by just 2.8% from 2026. Among many factors influencing the slowdown of the media and entertainment industry, consumer spending will remain the key reason as it continues to drop considering interest rate hikes and inflation. In PwC’s 26th Annual Global CEO Survey, around 40% of CEOs from the entertainment and media industry pointed out that their current business model would not be viable in ten years.\n\nBig Players in Media and Entertainment Industry\n\nCompanies in media and entertainment are trying to tap into new areas and markets.

(NASDAQ:WBD) are forming a joint venture to launch an innovative streaming sports service. Through this joint venture, all the companies will bring their portfolios of sports networks. The joint venture platform is expected to be launched in the second half of 2024 and will be available for customers through a new app. Each entity of the joint venture will have an equal board representation and own one-third stake in the venture.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is another leading American multinational mass media and entertainment corporation. On April 25, the company announced the launch of its proprietary first-party data platform, Olli. Through this new platform, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) now has control over the next generation of advanced advertising solutions for partners. In addition, Olli allows flawless campaign planning, activation, and measurement across the firm’s entire portfolio of premium content and brands.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Jim Simons Just Bought These 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "A good way to spot trends in the stock market is to look at which companies asset management firms are investing in. While there are a lot of hedge funds out there, one of the more closely followed portfolios hails from Renaissance Technologies.\n\nRenaissance is led by Jim Simons, who is actually a mathematician by trade. A look at the fund's most recent filings shows one clear trend: Renaissance is investing heavily in the technology sector right now.\n\nBut with just about every tech company parroting their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, it can become hard to discern the winners from the wannabes. Let's dig into Renaissance's portfolio and assess the most bullish opportunities from Simons and his team.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the third-largest position in Renaissance's portfolio, and the biggest among its \"Magnificent Seven\" holdings.\n\nWhat I find interesting about Nvidia's prominence in the portfolio compared to other tech stocks is its relationship with Renaissance's largest holding overall: Novo Nordisk. Although Renaissance trimmed its position in the Ozempic maker by 2.4 million shares last quarter, Novo Nordisk is still handily the top position in Simons' portfolio. Following a milestone year in 2023, Novo Nordisk recently teamed up with Nvidia to help accelerate AI in the healthcare world. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow during each quarter of the last 10 years. The obvious takeaway is that the newfound demand fueling AI services has ignited a new growth frontier for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, there's more to the picture here. Nvidia is playing a monumentally important role in the AI revolution. The company's H100 and A100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main engine fueling myriad AI applications, including training generative AI models, enhancing accelerated computing, and more.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are being deployed in Tesla vehicles to help with autonomous driving and are also being leveraged by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to hone its targeted advertising capabilities in an intensely crowded social media landscape.\n\nThe superior pricing power that Nvidia has achieved over the competition has resulted in staggering profit growth. As an investor, what's encouraging to see is that Nvidia is aggressively investing its profits into other high-growth opportunities.\n\nFor example, earlier this year Nvidia joined OpenAI, Intel, and Microsoft in a $675 million funding round for a humanoid robotics start-up called Figure AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think this is a particularly savvy move as Nvidia has a lucrative opportunity to help Figure AI's development from both a hardware and software perspective. In a way, owning Nvidia is similar to owning an index fund focused on several aspects of the AI realm.\n\nNvidia operates across semiconductor chips, robotics, enterprise software, and data center services. The prolific nature of its business is leading to a variety of AI-powered applications, and paving the way for a robust long-term roadmap.\n\nConsidering the enormous opportunities Nvidia orbits, it's not surprising to see the company earn such a high position in a highly regarded portfolio such as Renaissance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms rounds out the top five positions in the Renaissance portfolio. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Renaissance bought a whopping 2 million shares of Meta stock -- an increase of over 2,000% from its prior allocation.\n\n2023 was a transformational year for Meta, and I'm not surprised to see smart money pouring into the stock.\n\nLast year, Meta underwent several rounds of layoffs in an effort to reduce its expense profile -- which briefly became bloated following some hefty investments related to the metaverse in 2022. Moreover, the company doubled down on its core advertising business and proved that it can fend off rising competition from the likes of Alphabet and TikTok.\n\nThe table below illustrates some important operating metrics for Meta:\n\nMetric 2022 2023 Change Revenue $116.6 billion $134.9 billion 16% Operating income $28.9 billion $46.7 billion 62% Free cash flow $18.4 billion $43.0 billion 134%\n\nData source: Meta.\n\nMeta's return to respectable top-line growth combined with disciplined cost controls ultimately led to soaring profitability. The company demonstrated a true sign of maturity by announcing that it will be reinvesting these profits in the form of a dividend and an increased share repurchase program.\n\nConsidering Meta's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.5 is currently the second lowest among the Magnificent Seven, I think the stock looks especially attractive as sales and profits look to be back on the right track.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nThe last company I'll be exploring is Renaissance's sixth-largest holding, e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nI see Amazon in a similar light to that of Nvidia. While the company is largely known for its online store, Amazon is a far more prolific business. The company is a leader in cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and it also operates in the worlds of streaming and advertising.\n\nThe trends below hit on an important theme for Amazon investors. AMZN Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLingering inflation and high borrowing costs took a toll on Amazon's business over the last couple of years. However, 2023 was somewhat of a rebound year as Amazon sharply turned back to a consistently cash-flow-positive business. And just like Nvidia, Amazon is deploying this cash to ignite new growth.\n\nBack in September, Amazon committed to a $4 billion investment in AI start-up Anthropic. The overarching thesis of the deal was to integrate Anthropic into AWS to help unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nMoreover, AI has the potential to span across Amazon's entire ecosystem. For example, the technology can help Amazon discover cost efficiencies that it can integrate into warehouse and fulfillment centers, as well as new marketing tactics that it can employ for both the e-commerce and advertising segments.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 is essentially identical to its 10-year average, making it a compelling buy for long-term investors.\n\nI think Simons is onto something with his specific Magnificent Seven allocations, and I see each of the companies discussed above as solid opportunities for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy After Last Week's Big Moves: Alphabet, Meta, or Microsoft?",
        "content": "Earnings season is in full swing. To borrow from ABC's Wide World of Sports introduction from years ago, we can see \"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\" with companies' quarterly updates.\n\nSuch ups and downs were evident with several tech giants after they announced their quarterly results in recent days. Which is the best artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy after last week's big moves: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), or Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)?\n\nTwo victories, one defeat?\n\nIf we scored these three AI leaders based on their stock performances following their earnings updates last week, there would be two big victories and one defeat. The best news came from Google parent Alphabet, with the stock jumping close to 10% after the company announced its first-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nAlphabet's Q1 revenue rose 15% year over year to $80.5 billion. Earnings soared 57% higher to nearly $23.7 billion. The company's Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud businesses generated strong growth. Alphabet even pleasantly surprised investors by initiating a dividend for the first time.\n\nMicrosoft didn't wow investors quite as much but still delivered solid results in its fiscal 2024 third quarter. The company reported revenue of $61.9 billion, up 17% year over year. Its earnings jumped 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. AI continued to provide a major tailwind with server products and cloud services revenue increasing 24%.\n\nThe big loser of this group last week was Meta. Its stock plunged following the company's announcement of Q1 results on Wednesday. Meta's revenue rose 27% year over year to nearly $36.5 billion. Earnings skyrocketed 117% to almost $12.4 billion. Both numbers beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nSo what was the problem? During Meta's Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused primarily on initiatives that are losing money -- AI and the metaverse. The company also increased its full-year guidance for total expenses and capital expenditures, explaining that more spending would be needed for AI and metaverse development.\n\nThree winners\n\nI think Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta were all winners based on their impressive revenue and earnings growth in the latest quarter. More importantly, I expect all three stocks to be big winners for investors over the long term.\n\nSome worried that generative AI would be a \"Google killer.\" However, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the company's quarterly call that search usage is increasing among people who use Google's new AI overviews. He also stated, \"We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud as well as subscriptions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI continues to pay off in spades. The number of Microsoft Azure deals of $100 million or more jumped 80% year over year in the recent quarter, according to CEO Satya Nadella. The number of deals of $10 million-plus more than doubled. Microsoft's Copilot AI technology is boosting sales across the board.\n\nZuckerberg seemed to expect last week's sell-off of Meta shares. He said in the company's Q1 call, \"I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook -- where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\" However, he added, \"Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\"\n\nOne best pick right now\n\nSo which of these three AI stocks is the best pick right now? My vote goes to Meta.\n\nInvestors' negative reaction to Meta's quarterly update was way overdone, in my opinion. Zuckerberg was exactly right in his comments about the company's history of investing in new products that weren't monetized until later. I expect Meta will be successful in monetizing its AI and metaverse products too.\n\nMeta boasts the lowest valuation of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. I like (and own) Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, but now appears to be a great time to buy Meta on the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

McCaul was one of the leading politicians calling for a ban on TikTok.  He authored the bill against the Chinese social media company which the US Senate recently passed, calling TikTok a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" President Joe Biden has signed the bill into law that would ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance fails to divest the app within a year.\n\nCongressman McCaul's Purchase of Meta Platforms Gains Attention\n\nBut when Congressman McCaul was working against TikTok, he was also busy amassing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, according to his public disclosures. On March 5, the Congressman bought Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares worth between $100,000 to $250,000 at $490.22 per share. On March 1, he had bought somewhere between 200-498 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, at $502.3 per share. Analysts believe a ban on  TikTok would be a tailwind for US social media companies like Meta Platforms and Snapchat. Because of such overlaps, calls for a total ban on stock trading for politicians have been growing louder. But we aren’t interested in any such bans, since as retail investors any publicly available data showing what insiders are buying is an opportunity. Why?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nStock trades from politicians in the US have always sparked controversies and made headlines over the past few years. In 2022, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that thousands of officials working across 50 federal agencies were involved in buying or selling of stocks of companies that were directly affected by the decisions of their agencies. The Journal analyzed about 31,000 disclosures of 12,000 officials made during 2016 through 2021.\n\nDo Politicians Beat the Market?\n\nHowever, the most important question in any discussion surrounding American politicians trading stocks is this: do politicians' stock picks really beat the market? A detailed research by Unusual Whales found that in 2022, out of the 100 Congress members who traded stocks, 33% beat SPY with their portfolios. Another interesting insight highlighted in the report said that Democrats beat Republicans by significant margins. However, there were some anomalies. For example, former House Speak Nany Pelosi's portfolio, which is often a topic of discussion and is keenly watched by investors, fell about 19.8% in 2022, more than the 18% decline for the SPY.\n\nStory continues\n\nPoliticians' stock picking skills received massive attention during the pandemic days. For example, Senator Rand Paul's wife bought shares in Gilead Sciences just before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. So what? Analysts were quick to highlight that Paul was part of a Senate health committee that received special briefings from the then government about the pandemic situation in January 2020. American Politicians are Selling These Stocks\n\nThere have been several research reports highlighting instances where politicians used their influence to allegedly profit from different deals. For example a research paper titled “Trading” Political Favors: Evidence from the Impact of the STOCK Act\" talked about an interesting case from 2009:\n\n\"Politicians can favor certain groups of firms or individual firms in decisions that have significant economic impact on firm performance, such as the passage of legislations and regulations, the awarding of government contracts, and the selection into government programs. An example can be found in Congressman Tom Petri’s dealings with the Oshkosh Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and military vehicles. 2 In 2009, Representative Petri helped Oshkosh secure a $3 billion contract from the U.S. Army, after the award was challenged by a competitor and then under review by the Government Accountability Office, by sending letters and memos to colleagues and officials on the Hill and at the Pentagon including the Defense Secretary, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Army. Meanwhile, Petri owned a substantial amount of Oshkosh stock, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, and purchased additional shares as he was making contacts on behalf of the company to resolve the dispute. Oshkosh’s stock price rose from $8 per share in early 2009 to $38 per share in February 2010, when its contract with the Army was finalized.\n\nMethodology For this article we scanned publicly available data and filings of American politicians and picked 10 stocks Congress members and senators were selling over the past few months. Some top names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n10. BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nCongressman Scott Franklin from the Republican Party on March 21 sold a stake worth between $1 million to $5 million in insurance company BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP). Since then through April 24 BRP Group Inc's (NASDAQ:BRP) shares have lost about 8% in value.\n\nIn addition to BRP, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also seeing insider selling.\n\n9. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nGreg Steube, the Republican Congressman from Florida's 17th congressional district, on March 28 sold shares in Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV) worth between $15,000 to $50,000 at $40.06 per share. Since then the stock is down 8%.\n\n8. Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nSenator Tina Smith dumped insulin delivery systems company Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) shares on April 4 at $163.25. The total worth of these shares was between $50,000 to $100,000. Since then the stock is up 2.45%. Senator Markwayne Mullin also sold a stake in Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) back in December 2024.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n7. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nNextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks sold by American politicians in 2024. Senator Tina Smith sold a stake worth between $100,000 to $250,000 in NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) on April 4. Since then the stock has gained about 4.43%. Congressman Rick Allen also sold NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) shares worth between $15,000 to $50,000 back in December 2024.\n\nClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added a new position in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), in the utilities sector, which acquires, owns and manages contracted clean energy projects in the U.S. The company was at the center of the defensive stock storm when it slowed its renewable growth outlook modestly in late September, and the stock collapsed almost 30% in less than two weeks. We saw this as an opportunity to invest in arguably the best combination of a regulated utility and an experienced renewable operator with good long-term growth options. Even at a much-reduced estimated growth rate from higher financing costs, which will likely prove to be conservative, our estimate of intrinsic business value is materially higher.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NEE is also seeing selling from Washington insiders.\n\n6. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to suffer amid safety concerns around its planes. The stock is down 34% this year through April 25. Congressman Bill Keating from the Democratic Party on February 8 dumped a stake worth between $15,000 to $50,000 in Boein. He had also sold Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares worth between $1K to $15K on February 28 at $207 per share. Since February 8 through April 24 Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are down 21%.\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nLatest Insider Trading Activity: 11 Stocks Executives and Directors are Buying 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "title": "The AI trade is back, as confidence in Big Tech surges",
        "content": "The AI craze has returned to Wall Street — and investors are buying in.\n\nStandout quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) put the AI narrative back on track, sparking renewed confidence that big tech’s expensive bets on AI is boosting growth.\n\nAlphabet shares soared to an all-time high on Friday, closing above $2 trillion in market cap for the first time. Microsoft shares ended up 1.8%.\n\n“The AI investment story is intact,” BMO Wealth Management U.S. chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOutperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year.\n\n“They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.”\n\nResults from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago.\n\n“The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.”\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize.\n\nAnd the AI opportunity goes far beyond Microsoft and Google — the two companies often viewed by Wall Street as leaders in the AI race.\n\nRBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson told Yahoo Finance that Meta’s (META) selloff following earnings was an “overreaction,” and believes AI will be a “transformational driver\" for the company.\n\n“We’d be buying it,” Erickson said.\n\nThe rally in Mag 7 stocks comes ahead of key results from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) this week — two earnings reports that will be another critical test for the tech trade amid sky-high valuations.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Top 3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "With the global economy facing uncertain times, investors ought to position themselves in top blue-chip stocks. No, aligning yourself with the biggest publicly traded companies doesn’t guarantee you anything. However, it should help you sleep a little easier at night.\n\nFor one thing, the top blue-chip stocks are well-known enterprises, obviously. As mature businesses, it’s simply easier for Wall Street experts to predict their forward movements. You probably won’t get rich off these ideas. Over the long run, though, your portfolio should benefit from steady gains.\n\nFinally, because the big dogs are included in the benchmark indices, institutional investors have these shares in their portfolio. Again, that’s not a guarantee of success but the odds are stacked in your favor. On that note, below are top blue-chip stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the jitters impacting the technology space, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) might seem a risky idea. Yes, it is one of the top blue-chip stocks. At the same time, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) saw its shares plunge badly after the Facebook owner spooked Wall Street with its intention to “invest aggressively” in artificial intelligence.\n\nNaturally, fears exist among some circles that the AI train is getting ahead of itself. If that’s the case, the dynamic might impugn TSMC’s business, which manufactures and sells integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices. After all, the company’s sales have noticeably increased because of digital intelligence.\n\nWhile I myself have concerns about certain AI-related enterprises being overheated, there doesn’t appear to be sector-wide evidence that AI initiatives are fading. Further, TSMC serves myriad enterprises and functionalities.\n\nAnalysts are looking for sales of $84.12 billion in fiscal 2024 and $101.95 billion in fiscal 2025. Until clear evidence suggests otherwise, TSM is one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest integrated oil and gas companies in the world, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might not be the most popular idea for top blue-chip stocks. Ideologically, the company clashes with the broader push to move away from hydrocarbons. However, this directive – while certainly well meaning – doesn’t align with broader realities.\n\nOne of those realities is economic in nature. People simply can’t make the pivot to electric vehicles at scale. Indeed, many automakers are pivoting away from EVs and focusing their efforts on hybrid vehicles. Hybrids are combustion-based at the end of the day. So, Chevron should see continued demand, whether we like it or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, it is fair to point out that for the current fiscal year, analysts only project sales of $182.88 billion. That’s down 2.6% from last year’s print of $187.73 billion. Here’s the thing – geopolitical dynamics will likely drive crude oil prices higher. Notably, the most optimistic sales target calls for $202.19 billion. I think that’s more in line with the current geopolitical paradigm.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nFor full disclosure, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is arguably the riskiest idea among top blue-chip stocks on this list. As an entertainment giant with an enviable content portfolio, I normally wouldn’t think of the Magic Kingdom as particularly treacherous. However, the company has made some missteps in reading social trends. As Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) found out, it’s important not to push agendas too far.\n\nThat said, Disney owns a massive content library such as the Star Wars franchise. With a little tweaking in its storyboarding, the company could easily turn the franchise into an excuse to print money. The entertainment stalwart did it before; it can do so again.\n\nAnother attribute favoring Disney is the theme park and resort business. According to a Deloitte report, while the revenge travel sentiment specifically may be fading, consumers will likely continue to prioritize experiential-based expenditures. If that’s the case, Disney can win out.\n\nNotably, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $128.93 average price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "One Third of Billionaire David Tepper's Portfolio Is Made Up of These 3 Magnificent Seven Stocks",
        "content": "Before becoming the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers and MLS's Charlotte FC, David Tepper made his name (and money) through Appaloosa Management, a global hedge fund he founded. Tepper, whose net worth is around $20 billion, is one of the top 100 richest people in the world. Needless to say, he's had success in the investing world.\n\nGiven Tepper's success, it makes sense that investors would look to his and his hedge fund's investments to gain tips. While the average investor and billionaire hedge fund managers don't have the same risk tolerance or investment goals, there's nothing wrong with looking to them for inspiration.\n\nTepper's portfolio is fairly concentrated, with almost a third being held in three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. If investors want solid businesses with long-term sustainability, they need look no further.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) became a household name because of its e-commerce business, but it has since branched out and become a major player in a handful of industries.\n\nFor a while, Amazon's e-commerce business was unprofitable and used mainly as a revenue generator. It's still Amazon's biggest revenue source, but it has recently become profitable. In the fourth quarter, Amazon's North American segment made around $6.5 billion in operating profits, an impressive turnaround from the $240 million it lost in Q4 2022. Its international segment lost $419 million, which isn't ideal, but it still leaves Amazon profitable in its non-Amazon Web Services (AWS) businesses. AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThere's still room for growth in e-commerce, but much of Amazon's growth will rely on its cloud service, AWS. Although AWS growth slowed recently, 13% year-over-year (YOY) growth isn't too shabby for Amazon's biggest profit-maker. AWS has a commanding market share in global cloud services but has lost a little ground over the past year. Still, its market share is 31%, which leads Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure (a 24% share) and Alphabet's Google Cloud (11%).\n\nIn the long term, Amazon stands to benefit from the organic growth of cloud services and e-commerce. However, the company has also shown that it's willing to make investments in new industries. Take its $13.7 billion Whole Foods purchase and healthcare ambitions, for example. Investors can count on the company not getting complacent.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nThere are diverse tech businesses, and then there's Microsoft, the poster child for casting a wide net of businesses.\n\nMicrosoft didn't become the world's most valuable public company by accident; it's taken years of impressive business growth and a boost from AI mania. The latter may also carry the company through its next phases of growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's strategic partnership with OpenAI -- which gives it exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) -- could be exactly what it needs to further strengthen its hold on office software. From Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) to Azure to Teams, Microsoft is almost unavoidable in the corporate world.\n\nMicrosoft's abundance of corporate clients gives it an edge in ensuring its longevity and shielding against economic and market downturns. When times get hard, consumers can easily forego the newest smartphones or online shopping, and businesses can cut back on their advertising. It's much harder for companies to stop using Office software, migrate their data off the cloud, or jump ship from established communication platforms like Teams.\n\nWith Microsoft, investors can be confident they're investing in a company built for sustained growth over the long haul.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nFacebook creator Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) continues to be one of the premier cash cow businesses, earning around $36.5 billion in revenue in Q1, up 27% YOY.\n\nAveraging 3.24 billion family daily active people in March 2024 (up 7% YOY), Facebook shows why it continues to be a go-to for many of the top advertisers globally. Meta has capitalized on this, increasing its family average revenue per person from $9.47 in Q1 2023 to $11.20 in Q1 2024.\n\nDespite the growth in key metrics, Meta's stock plummeted after releasing its latest earnings, dropping as much as 15% on the same day. Much of this is because of the company's spending plan going forward, which mostly surrounds its AI infrastructure. Meta said it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion this year, up from the prior $30 billion to $37 billion estimate. META Capital Expenditures (Annual) Chart\n\nInvestors may not agree with the spending plan, but their reaction seems overreactive. The good news, though, is that its lower valuation makes it a more compelling entry point.\n\nInvestors should also appreciate Meta's new dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend yield isn't enough to please most income-seeking investors, but it's an incentive that can encourage investors' patience as Meta works on its AI plans.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Think more power-packed Gatorade powders and tablets for workout freaks like yours truly. Let's do this!\n\nSpeaking of workouts, Chipotle (CMG) CFO Jack Hartung told Yahoo Finance that he's OK with the chain being the go-to post fat-burning sessions. He was responding to a new WSJ article that suggested workout buffs are supporting the chain's higher prices.\n\nThen Snowflake's (SNOW) new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, squeezed in an AI product drop ahead of its earnings. He promised that the cloud computing company would be picking up the pace on artificial intelligence innovations this year, aiming to satisfy the Street's appetite for newness.\n\nRamaswamy also called Yahoo Finance \"iconic.\"\n\nWe appreciate that, Sridhar — and we certainly agree!\n\nBut all in all, I have hated this earnings season.\n\nWhy? Because of all the bad news that is piling up and catching investors off guard.\n\nSurprises have been all over the place.\n\nFor instance, one of the early themes this season is higher-than-expected costs for businesses. And it’s not just UPS (UPS) calling out rising gas prices and the return of fuel surcharges or PepsiCo saying inflation is still in their pipeline.\n\nIt’s Chipotle seeing higher tech costs to support new restaurant software. Investments like this (and wage increases) held back profits in the first quarter.\n\nIt’s Meta (META) materially lifting its full-year capital expenditures guidance and hinting at even bigger spending in 2025 — all because of unknown AI projects. This surprised shareholders and Mark Zuckerberg fans alike.\n\nIt’s Ford (F) losing lots of money on EVs because of higher-than-expected costs.\n\nThen there is the weakness emanating from forward-looking sectors such as truckers and railroads.\n\nTrucker J.B. Hunt (JBHT) had this to say on the economic backdrop: \"We continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure.\" Brutal acknowledgment. The stock was hammered.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) stated that the last two years have \"felt\" like the 2009 recession.\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) had this to say this week: \"We expect continued mixed impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic non-premium Intermodal pricing.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, IBM (IBM) CFO Jim Kavanaugh struck a more cautious note when I asked him about soft sales at its lucrative consulting business.\n\n\"We still see very good demand out in the marketplace around large transformational deals, digital transformation,\" Kavanaugh said. \"We had our largest first quarter in consulting signings in many years. So the demand profile is out there. Our AI bookings for consulting in the first quarter doubled all of 2023.\"\n\n\"But what we're seeing, just given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, is ... a tightening of discretionary spending, no different than Accenture and all the other consulting companies that are impacting the short-term revenue realization.”\n\nMarkets have responded in kind to the dose of badness.\n\n\"I really think this is actually a dip buying opportunity. It's never fun to live through it, but these are normal pullbacks,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\n\nThought I would leave you on a happy note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 under-the-radar high dividend stocks to invest in now. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nDividend investing in back in the limelight in 2024. Tech companies, which are mainly known for their growth initiatives, are now venturing into another territory by starting their dividend policies. Earlier this year, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) took the leap with its inaugural dividend announcement, soon followed by Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also joined the dividend club by announcing its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share. This way, these companies are providing shareholders with dual benefits of potential for growth and capital return. Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management Corp, made the following comment on Alphabet’s new dividend in his interview with Bloomberg:\n\n“A dividend would be well received. While investors are still looking for growth from these companies, today there is also value in cost discipline and the decision to initiate a dividend suggests that management will be prudent and attempt to allocate capital in a way that balances growth and capital return.”\n\nDividends paid by the US companies have increased significantly over the years. In our article titled 14 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In, we referred to S&P Dow Jones Indices data, which revealed that dividend payments of the S&P 500 companies jumped from $420 billion in 2017 to $565 billion in 2022. Last year, the figure reached its all-time high of $588.2 billion. Global dividends also hit their record high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, achieving their third consecutive year of a new high after a slight drop during the pandemic of 2020, according to a report by Janus Henderson Group Plc. This marked a 5% growth from $1.57 trillion in dividend payouts in 2022. The report now forecasts that total dividends will rise to a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year, showing a 3.9% increase on a headline basis.\n\nDividends have remained an important part of the stock market historically. In fact, dividends accounted for an average of 34% of the S&P 500’s overall return from 1940 to 2023. Dividend stocks are also recognized for their tendency to fare better during market downturns. For example, during a market decline such as the one witnessed in 2022, dividend stocks in the S&P 500 fell by over 11%, compared to an over 18% decline in the S&P 500. Moreover, in that year, companies that did not pay dividends suffered a much steeper loss of 38.7%. Dividend growers take the lead in dividend investing, providing investors with regular growing streams of income. We previously reported in one of our articles that over the past 20 years ending in 2022, dividend growers and initiators have returned 10.68%, surpassing a 2.70% return of those that cut or eliminated their dividends during this period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) are well-known among dividend investors, numerous other dividend-paying companies maintain a low profile. However, sometimes these companies tend to be well-established businesses that have a competitive edge in industries experiencing slow growth. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best under-the-radar stocks that pay dividends. 12 Under-the-Radar High Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron’s, and Business Insider.

        "title": "A Second-Chance Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock Down 17% to Buy Now",
        "content": "When a great company's stock trades for a fair price, it's usually worth buying. It rarely pays to wait for a better price, even if the stock has gone up significantly over the past few months.\n\nBut sometimes you'll get lucky, and the market will put a great stock on sale due to near-term concerns. Meanwhile, the long-term outlook for the company still looks promising. Those second chances are rare, so you should pounce on them when you see them.\n\nThe market appears to be giving investors a great second chance with Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) right now. Despite strong first-quarter earnings, analysts were scared off by the company's plans to increase spending, particularly focusing on its potential in artificial intelligence (AI). Shares currently trade 17% below where they were just two weeks ago after a steep post-earnings sell-off.\n\nHere's why investors should take the opportunity to buy shares now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy the market punished Meta stock\n\nMeta's first-quarter earnings results were better than expected. Strong revenue growth and bottom-line results were fueled by growing ad prices and impressions.\n\nWhere things took a turn was in the company's outlook for the second quarter and full year. The midpoint of Meta's second-quarter revenue outlook came in below what analysts were expecting.\n\nBut analysts had an even bigger issue with the planned increase in spending. Meta now expects to generate total expenses between $96 billion and $99 billion, raising the lower end of that guidance from $94 billion. Capital expenditures will range from $35 billion to $40 billion, up from previous guidance of between $30 billion and $37 billion.\n\nThere's a clear reason Meta's increasing its spending. It sees an enormous opportunity in artificial intelligence. But it has to spend heavily to take advantage of it.\n\nMeta isn't a stranger to spending heavily to advance products and services it believes have a lot of potential to reach 1 billion users and generate a large amount of revenue at some point in the distant future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed this out during his prepared remarks after the earnings release, noting, \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook -- where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nTo be sure, the market punished Meta's shares after it announced investments in its mobile feed, Stories, Reels, and more. But investors who stuck with Meta have been handsomely rewarded as the stock reached a new all-time high earlier this month. With the recent pullback in shares, investors have a new opportunity to start or add to their positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's AI ambitions\n\nZuckerberg thinks Meta can be the leading AI company in the world. Previous versions of the company's LLaMA large language model have shown promising results, occasionally beating leading competitors like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Anthropic's Claude in certain benchmark tests. The new LLaMA 3 model released last week is even more advanced.\n\n\"I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during Meta's first-quarter earnings call. \"And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us.\"\n\nMeta's AI efforts are key components of its family of apps. AI powers its recommended content in Facebook and Instagram, particularly in its Reels product. Moreover, Meta uses AI to determine which person sees which ads, when they see them, and how many ads each person sees. It recently completely overhauled its ad ranking system to improve efficiency, and that's proven successful. The increase in ad impressions and average ad price is a good indication there. Meta also incorporates generative AI within its ad creation platform, and says the use of those tools has doubled year over year.\n\nZuckerberg pointed out several ways to build a massive profitable business on the back of generative AI:\n\nUsing AI-powered chatbots to help businesses respond to customers faster and more accurately. Ads or paid content within AI interactions. Options to pay to use more advanced AI or more compute power.\n\nBut those ambitions are still years away. \"I'd say that's the main thing that I'm focused on for this year and probably a lot of next year is growing that product and the other AI products and the engagement around them,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nA great opportunity to buy shares\n\nDespite the step-up in operating expenses and capital expenditures, the sell-off appears to be an overreaction. Meta's core earnings results were fantastic, and the outlook for the business remains strong.\n\nAt its core, Meta is an advertising business. And ad sales grew 27% last quarter. At the midpoint of its outlook, management expects revenue to climb 18%. While total expenses might climb a bit higher than originally anticipated, investors can still expect strong double-digit growth in operating income. When you combine that with Meta's massive share repurchase plan, earnings per share will continue to climb at a strong pace for the foreseeable future.\n\nAfter the sell-off, Meta shares trade for just over 20 times analysts' estimates for 2025 earnings. While some analysts may adjust those earnings expectations downward after management's comments around spending to grow the AI business, it's still a great value at this price.\n\nImportantly, if Meta's ambitions in artificial intelligence play out as Zuckerberg expects, it could have another massive business on its hands, adding to the upside potential of the stock. Second-chance opportunities don't come around often, but with the recent sell-off in the stock, I'd buy shares here if you've been sitting on the sidelines watching the stock price go up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Meta stock plunged 15% after hours on the update, even though first-quarter results were strong.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter jumped 27% to $36.5 billion, its fastest growth rate in several quarters, and edged out estimates at $36.2 billion.

On the bottom line, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share jumped 114% to $4.71, topping expectations at $4.32.\n\nOther key metrics also testified to the resurgence of the business, as the average price per ad rose 6% and total impressions jumped 20%. Its user base continued to grow as well, with the company reporting a 7% increase in family daily active people.\n\nHowever, what spoiled an otherwise strong quarter was the company's guidance. Meta called for only modest sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, or $37.75 billion at the midpoint, which was below the analyst consensus at $38.29 billion.\n\nMeta didn't give guidance on the bottom line, but the company raised both its expense guidance for the year and its capital expenditure guidance, which also seemed to impact investor sentiment. The company now expects total expenses for the year of $96 billion to $99 billion, up from its previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion, and it forecast $35 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures versus its earlier forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy investors balked at the guidance\n\nStocks are valued based on future cash flows, so in some ways it makes sense that investors are more concerned with guidance than the strong first-quarter results.\n\nOn the surface, the increase in expense guidance is modest, as it just raised the midpoint by $1 billion, but investors may be skeptical about another boondoggle, since the company's metaverse project has torched tens of billions of dollars with seemingly little benefit so far. In the first quarter, the Reality Labs segment, which is focused on the metaverse, brought in just $440 million in revenue and posted an operating loss of $3.8 billion.\n\nMeta said the increase in expense guidance was due to higher infrastructure and legal costs, and that operating losses would continue to increase meaningfully in Reality Labs. As for capital expenditures, it cited increased infrastructure investments to support its AI roadmap.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the guidance, Meta's valuation has gotten a lot richer as the stock has soared over the last year or so, and the pullback may reflect that reality.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity or a warning sign?\n\nIt's not easy to parse Meta's investment, as the spending on Reality Labs and AI represent different things, though the company sees them as connected.\n\nManagement seems to have no plan for driving profitability from Reality Labs, and the recent results show that the Quest 3 has been a disappointment. On the other hand, the AI investments seem justified, especially as the generative AI opportunity still seems wide open.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the company's Meta AI assistant and explained how the company was working on turning the chatbot into a more capable agent that can follow more complex assignments and do things like research information or book flights. Given that nearly half of the world's population uses a Meta product every day, the company has the user relationships to leverage as it seeks to build an audience, giving it a competitive advantage.\n\nAt the current price, Meta seems likely to be a winner over the long term, as it still dominates social media advertising and has proven it's capable of controlling spending when needed.\n\nHowever, the stock is likely to be volatile over the coming months as the spending ramp-up is risky. Investors should be prepared for a further pullback, but for long-term investors, the current sell-off looks like a buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. Beat Analyst Estimates: See What The Consensus Is Forecasting For This Year",
        "content": "Last week, you might have seen that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released its quarterly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.9% to US$443 in the past week. Meta Platforms reported US$36b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.71 beat expectations, being 8.9% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Meta Platforms from 56 analysts is for revenues of US$158.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply a meaningful 11% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 11% to US$20.10. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$158.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$20.02 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$523. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Meta Platforms, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$600 and the most bearish at US$400 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Meta Platforms shareholders.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 15% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 16% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 9.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that Meta Platforms is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Meta Platforms going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nDon't forget that there may still be risks.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nEstablished in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation.\n\nBanks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment.\n\nDespite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected.\n\nCurious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.\n\nIt’s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients’ needs. And we’re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our roster of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we reviewed the bank's submissions to the SEC, pinpointing its 15 most substantial investment holdings.

Here is what the firm commented:\n\n“Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.”\n\n6.

        "title": "Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI. Investors liked both.",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nInvestors were treated to two different versions of artificial intelligence this week. And both sound pretty good.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to “jointly experiment” with Microsoft’s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software.\n\nAnd when Microsoft’s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction — up 10% Friday — as investors reconsidered the company’s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification.\n\nOn the other side of the table was Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers — they’re in conversations, Elon Musk said — and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon’s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s.\n\nThese are two very different visions of an AI future. “Productivity software” certainly doesn’t have the same ring as “robotaxi,” which is on the fun end of Peter Thiel’s “we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” spectrum we discussed two weeks ago.\n\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, investors liked both of them.\n\nAnd they should. Tesla’s surge was partially about rebutting some reasonable investor fears — cutting costs to tackle lagging demand and reaffirming that cheaper EVs are on the way. But the bigger story was the self-driving AI vision from the grand visionary.\n\nThis is rare, and it’s why some people love Elon. For the most part, the path of AI first runs through the tedious corporate world of programmatic advertising and productivity tools, the core businesses of today’s big AI software/cloud players — Google, Microsoft, and Meta.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla’s splashy self-driving future of consumer cars and robotaxis is far more aligned with the “change the world” Big Tech expectation (aspiration, really) than the “better Office 365” reality we so often see.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut these more mundane improvements are everything. It’s important to remember the lessons that any regional American city will teach you: Tons of America’s rich simply took the practical route, embracing the less glamorous business of fast-food franchising, agricultural processing, waste management, car dealerships, commercial properties, not to mention all the other B2B things you’d never think twice about. For every Zuckerberg, there are thousands of Buddy Garritys.\n\nZuckerberg, however, may have taken the mundane too far Wednesday in Meta’s earnings call by, as our Hamza Shaban put it, making AI aspirations “seem small.” The company talked about “scaling business messaging,” “better ad insertion,” and selling AI computing power.\n\nAnd as we wrote in March, breaking productivity barriers is huge for the economy. But you still have to sell them. After all, they're still \"productivity gains,\" not flying cars.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Nvidia Who? 3 AI Plays Destined to Outshine the Industry Giant",
        "content": "Investors have been snookered by technology head fakes in the past. The metaverse was hardly the game-changing advance we were promised. Very few people, it turns out, actually want to be connected to their computers all day, every day to work, play and interact. The metaverse may hold some value but the exponential market opportunity analysts predicted seems way off the mark.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is different. Today, businesses are realizing tangible real-world benefits of utilizing AI. Speed bumps will emerge along the way, of course. Energy consumption is going to strain just how far the technology can go. Water for cooling systems will divert an already scarce resource from other equally vital needs. But unlike the metaverse, AI is the real deal.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the early stages of AI’s breakout. Its advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) chips were readily able to handle the complex and all-consuming nature of AI’s demands. But with more competition developing equally powerful chips, Nvidia stock may not be the winning play it once was.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three companies are AI stocks to outshine Nvidia in the next stage of the technology’s evolution and growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough best known as a smartphone chipmaker, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) flies under the radar of many investors as an AI stock. They might be surprised to learn Broadcom is actually the second-largest AI chipmaker by revenue behind Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker generated $4 billion in annual AI revenue last year but reported $2.3 billion in the first quarter, quadruple the year-ago figure. It estimates 35% of fiscal 2024 revenue will come from AI, or some $10 billion. Previously the chipmaker forecast a quarter of its revenue, or $8 billion, would be from AI but growth is accelerating.\n\nThe reason for the increase is data center demand from hyperscalers. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators are behind the designs of the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Also, it designed a custom chip for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At its investor day in March, Broadcom announced it signed on a third large cloud customer for its AI accelerators.\n\nLook for the chipmaker to readily surpass Nvidia in the near future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another surprising AI chipmaker that is on a path to outshine Nvidia. The chipmaker is looking for AI revenue to double this year and then keep doubling for several years thereafter. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a customer, and earlier this month announced it won another large customer for its AI chips. The one downside for Marvell Technology is that its custom chips carry lower gross margins than its off-the-shelf chip business.\n\nYet, custom chips will be a significant driver of future revenue growth. And Marvell Technology is looking to make up in volume what it loses in margins. For that reason, the chipmaker maintained its gross margin forecast when it reported earnings recently. Marvell says adjusted gross margins will be between 62% and 63% in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nWhere the chipmaker is expected to excel is in the electro-optical chips that sell into data centers and AI networks. With both channels anticipated to see significant expansion in the coming years, Marvell Technology will experience rapid growth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock that should outshine Nvidia in the future is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay, just about every chipmaker turns to TSM to make its chips – Nvidia included.\n\nWhen the chipmaker reported earnings the other day, it shook the market by implying a slowdown coming in the semiconductor market. However, it forecast its own business to keep growing with guidance of “low- to mid-20%” revenue growth. AI was the primary reason for it.\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei said the contract manufacturer was still experiencing a “surge in AI-related demand.” He termed it “insatiable.” It is yet another semiconductor stock expecting AI to cause revenue to “more than double this year.” TSM forecasts AI will represent a “low-teens” percentage of full-year sales.\n\nWith Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as top customers, so long as their respective AI business grows, you can be sure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will outshine them all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Billionaires Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander Are Buying",
        "content": "Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander are some of the most successful investors in history.\n\nAll three are billionaires, and their respective hedge funds -- Renaissance Technologies, Bridgewater Associates, and Millennium Management -- have made thousands of investors rich along with them.\n\nIn investing, there are no bonus points for originality, so it pays to study the masters. In fact, thanks to the 13F filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter, you can invest alongside these billionaires as well.\n\nAccording to Motley Fool Research, these investors all own three of the same \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. Keep reading to see what they are and if these stocks are right for you. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's probably not a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) on this list. More than any other company, Nvidia has been the flag bearer of the AI boom as its sales and profits skyrocketed over the last year, propelling the stock past a $2 trillion market cap, and making it the third-most valuable company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, and the company has faced little competition thus far, though competition is coming.\n\nSimons, Dalio, and Englander all count Nvidia among their top holdings. At Renaissance Technologies, Nvidia is the second-largest tech holding, making up 1.2% of the portfolio, or $767.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nDalio's Bridgewater Associates, meanwhile, counts Nvidia as its third-largest tech holding with $133 million in Nvidia stock at the end of Q4. The fast-growing chip stock made up 0.7% of Bridgewater's portfolio.\n\nFinally, Nvidia makes up the fourth-largest tech holding in Englander's Millennium Management at 1% of the portfolio, or $1.02 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if these funds held, added to, or sold Nvidia in Q1, but we'll learn soon as 13F filings are due by mid-May. If they hold on to their Nvidia stakes, that move paid off as the stock jumped 82% in Q1.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is another top holding of these hedge funds, and like Nvidia, it's soared over the last year and a half. While Meta has benefited from the AI boom, the primary reason for its surge is a successful turnaround driven by cost cutting and a resurgence in its ad business that led to record profits.\n\nLooking ahead, the company still seems to have plenty of growth in front of it, especially with the new opportunity in AI, though some advertisers have recently complained that the company's ad manager has been unreliable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Renaissance, Meta represents the fund's fourth-largest holding in the tech sector with $744 million worth of Meta stock. Meta makes up 1.2% of the fund's value.\n\nRay Dalio's Bridgewater, meanwhile, is even more bullish on Meta as the social media giant makes up 1.3% of its portfolio as its second-biggest tech holding. The fund finished Q4 with $235.8 million worth of Meta stock.\n\nLastly, Millennium held $719.7 million in Meta stock as of the end of Q4, or 0.7% of the portfolio. That made it its fifth-largest tech holding.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nFinally, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has long been a top stock among hedge funds as the Google parent's competitive advantages are manifest with its dominant search engine, properties like YouTube, and promising \"moonshot\" businesses like its Waymo autonomous vehicle unit, and its AI investments like Google Brain and DeepMind.\n\nAlphabet hasn't had the kind of blowout performance over the past year that Nvidia and Meta have, but it's still outperformed the S&P 500 and recently touched an all-time high. Given its history of reliable growth and wide economic moat, it's not surprising that Alphabet is also a top pick among these three funds.\n\nAt Renaissance, Alphabet was its sixth-largest tech holding, worth $487.2 million, or 0.8% of the total portfolio.\n\nBridgewater was more bullish on Alphabet than any other tech stock, counting it as its top-tech holding at 1.6% of the total portfolio. As of the end of Q4, Bridgewater owned $285.6 million worth of Alphabet stock.\n\nMillennium also counts Alphabet as a top holding as the Google owner's stock makes up 1.8%, or $1.56 billion. Only Microsoft is a larger tech holding at Englander's fund.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nHedge fund ownership isn't a guarantee of outperformance, but it's worth tracking the moves of the biggest investors, especially if their holdings are similar to yours.\n\nKeep your eye on these stocks come mid-May as they could move once we learn which funds bought and sold them in Q1. Nonetheless, I'd expect them to remain top holdings among the biggest hedge funds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Instagram, YouTube the biggest likely winners of TikTok ban but smaller rivals could rise too",
        "content": "Adult U.S. TikTok users spend an average of 54 minutes on the app on any given day, more than Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube, according to research firm eMarketer. If TikTok were to disappear, those platforms — along with younger, smaller emerging rivals — would be scrambling for those valuable minutes of people's attention.\n\nBut with an actual ban still likely years away, it's not clear what app will be its biggest beneficiary. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, may see more advertisers amid uncertainty for its biggest rival, according to analysts who follow the company. Creators, dealing with uncertainty themselves are also expanding to other platforms if they weren’t already. But users, especially the younger ones who are TikTok’s bread and butter, are less predictable. Will they embrace Instagram, a possibly uncool mom favorite? Or could a newer app like Triller rise to viral fame?\n\nHere's a look at some notable TikTok alternatives and how they measure up.\n\nINSTAGRAM\n\nMeta has a long tradition of cloning competitive services, with varying degrees of success. The Instagram “Story” feature, which lets people share photos and videos that expire in 24 hours, is similar to Snapchat. The company also launched a TikTok knockoff called Lasso in 2018 but closed that down in 2020.\n\nThen Instagram launched Reels 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. It’s proven to be massively popular. Could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta's algorithm is addictive, it's still not TikTok.\n\n“Replicating TikTok’s algorithm is a nearly impossible task, as rival Meta would attest to,\" said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “TikTok’s ability to serve up relevant and entertaining content to its users is unparalleled in the social media world.”\n\nYOUTUBE\n\nWhile TikTok gets more headlines, YouTube still dominates U.S. teens' attention. Roughly nine in ten teens said they use YouTube, in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, making it the most widely used platform among the 13-17 crowd. TikTok clocked in at 63%, Snapchat at 60% and Instagram at 59%. Its parent company Google launched YouTube Shorts in 2020, shortly after India banned TikTok.\n\nYouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, watching hours of bite-sized videos. As with Reels, many of the videos featured are from TikTok or creators who post to several different platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos, so it may not have the variety that TikTok users are looking for — at least not yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nSNAPCHAT\n\nWhile older adults never quite got into Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, it remains popular among teens and younger adults. In addition to its disappearing video feature, the company launched Snapchat Spotlight in 2020 (yes, the same year India banned TikTok and former U.S. President Donald Trump was trying to in the U.S.). The feature can be accessed by pressing the sideways triangle icon at the bottom of your screen and, at least according to Snapchat, it “shines a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.”\n\nTRILLER, ZIGAZOO AND OTHERS\n\nIf you're sick of the establishment crowd, newer startups such as Triller offer possible alternatives, with TikTok-like features and more (or sometimes less). Triller, which is getting acquired by a Hong-Kong-based company, is popular for music videos and has tried to lure TikTok creators to its platform, but its user base lags far behind its bigger rivals and the content appears to offer less variety, at least for now.\n\nZigazoo, meanwhile, stands out from the crowd because it is created with kids in mind and shows kid-appropriate content, according to its creators. The nonprofit Common Sense Media says “Parents need to know that Zigazoo is a TikTok-style video sharing app for posting short videos of kids completing a variety of kid-appropriate challenges.”\n\n“Zigazoo is meant to be used with a parent, and personal data is treated as though it’s from those over 13,” Common Sense says. “Challenges are simple investigative or creative projects like ‘Can you find something that’s symmetrical?’ or ‘Can you teach us how to play your favorite sport or physical activity?’”\n\nBut with a TikTok ban still uncertain, it's possible that new, better rivals will crop up in the months and years ahead as ByteDance cycles through its legal options to keep the app operating in the U.S. And if not — users might consider those extra 54 minutes a day as a gift, for spending time away from screens, with friends, family, or curled up with a good book.\n\nView comments",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can look at the 5 Fastest Rising Universities in the US.\n\nHigher Education Trends in the US\n\nThe higher education situation in the United States is changing; some recent reports show that college dropout rates in the region are increasing. According to a report by the Education Data Initiative, the college dropout rate increased to 32.9% in 2023. Moreover, 40 million Americans were recorded to drop out of college in 2021, and only 864,824 students re-enrolled for the fall semester during the same year. The rise in college dropouts is attributed to financial concerns, the inability to manage living expenditures, lack of motivation to study a particular program, and the passion to earn money without a degree due to the hot job market. Although the Education Data Initiative finds that college dropouts make 35% less income on average than those with a bachelor’s degree, wanting to start a business or pursuing a job remains one of the most common reasons behind dropping out. A report by the World Economic Forum found that approximately 31% of US college students intended to drop out to find a job in 2022; moreover, 29% mentioned the rising cost of living as a reason for not returning to college. To read more about universities, you can look at the 20 Largest Universities in the World and the 15 Cheapest American Universities with Low Tuition for International Students.\n\nGrowing Education Technology Market\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic pushed the traditional education system a step further towards technology as colleges around the globe adapted education technologies to foster e-learning. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global education technology market was valued at $142.37 billion in 2023. The EdTech market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4%, reaching $343.33 billion by 2030. As per the sector-wise analysis, the K-12 EdTech segment led the market share in 2023 and contributed over 40% in revenue growth. Regionally, North America dominates the market and held approximately 36% market share in 2023. The growth in the region is attributed to the adoption of personalized learning and digital skills. You can also look at the Academic Ranking of World Universities: Top 30.\n\nThe EdTech market in the US is also poised for growth and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2024 to 2030.

        "content": "A lot of technology stocks are battered and bruised. Many once high-flying mega-cap tech stocks are taking it on the chin. This week, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are down more than 10% after the tech giant issued disappointing guidance and mounting losses at its new ventures unit, Reality Labs. With interest rates expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, tech stocks seem particularly vulnerable to a downturn right now.\n\nIn recent weeks, entire subsectors of tech have moved lower, notably stocks of companies working in the areas of semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. How long the current downturn lasts is anyone’s guess. That said, there are some tech stocks that are showing tentative signs of recovery and could be poised for a turnaround in coming months, driven by earnings and other catalysts. Here are three tech stocks to buy in anticipation of an epic rebound.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is by no means out of the woods. The electric vehicle maker just reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and its first-quarter profit plunged 55% from a year earlier. That said, the worst of the selloff in TSLA stock appears to be over. In the two days since the company’s Q1 print, Tesla’s share price has risen 13%. The stock now looks to have bottomed at $138. Investors looking to bottom fish Tesla might want to buy the stock now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA lot is riding on the company’s ability to bring a more affordable electric vehicle to market by early 2025, as CEO Elon Musk promised during the Q1 earnings call with analysts and media. Cost controls and plans to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce will also be important, as is the ability to license its driver assistance system to other automakers. If Musk and his management team can pull it all off, then Tesla could prove to be one great comeback story. In the meantime, TSLA stock is trending upwards.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been a long-term laggard. In the last five years, TXN stock has risen 50%. Compare that to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 1,817% gain over the same period. While disappointing, Texas Instruments looks like it might be starting to get its mojo back after years of chronic underperformance. The company’s share price rose 7% in a day after the legacy tech concern reported better-than-expected financial results for Q1 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20, which was much better than Wall Street forecasts of $1.07. Revenue during the first three months of the year came in at $3.66 billion, also ahead of analyst estimates of $3.6 billion. In terms of guidance, Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The Q2 guidance aligns with Wall Street forecasts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might not be long before consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stages an epic rebound. In 2024, AAPL stock is one of the worst performers among tech securities. So far this year, Apple’s share price is down nearly 9%, and a laggard in the benchmark S&P 500 index. However, there are potential catalysts looming on the horizon. All eyes will be on the company’s May 2 earnings report. People will also be watching a May 7 event where Apple is expected to unveil a revamped version of its iPad tablet.\n\nApple’s signature tablet, the iPad, launched in 2010 and has not been significantly updated since 2018. A new iPad could help to boost sales of the device, which declined 25% to $7.02 billion in this year’s first quarter, according to industry estimates. Sales across all Apple products have suffered amid economic uncertainty and as consumers cutback on spending. Revitalizing its electronic devices could boost sales and AAPL stock. Unveiling AI applications at its developers conference in June could also help.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares are rallying back from last week’s selloff as some of the chip giant’s biggest clients are doubling down on artificial intelligence investments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Fed’s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock is up 15% this week, adding more than $260 billion in market capitalization and putting it on pace for its best weekly performance since last May. The surge comes after firms like Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. pledged billions in AI investments.\n\n“The future is AI,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares. “And if the largest companies in the world are pouring tens of billions of dollars each into this, I think Nvidia has to be the big winner.”\n\nThe move is a sharp reversal from last Friday’s 10% plunge, the shares’ worst day in more than four years, which came amid fears that enthusiasm for chipmakers had run too far too fast after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. scaled back its expansion outlook.\n\nNvidia currently dominates the lucrative market for accelerators that power data centers running complex computing tasks required for AI development. But the entire semiconductor industry is climbing, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, also known as the SOX, up 9.7% this week, compared with a 2.8% gain in the broader S&P 500 Index and a 4% jump in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nFirst-quarter reports “from key US hyperscalers - Google, Microsoft and Meta - suggest meaningful upside to CY24 capex, mostly driven by buildout of AI infrastructure,” Bank of America Corp. analysts lead by Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients on April 25.\n\nMeta shares were pressured on Thursday, tumbling 11%, after the Facebook-parent revealed that it will spend billions of dollars more than expected on AI this year. But Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet were able to convince investors that spending on AI was already paying off.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com Inc., another big Nvidia customer, is slated to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.\n\n“I hate to say things are a no-brainer,” Marino said. “But if you take a look at all the budget lines and all the capex spending, where is that going? It’s got to go to Nvidia, they have the best chips.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta is betting the farm on AI, and it’s alarming its investors. In its earnings report Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the tech giant was raising its estimates for capital expenditures, which includes spending on AI training and data centers, by billions of dollars—and it anticipates it will scale up even more down the line.\n\nMeta raised its spending estimates to $35-$40 billion, up from $30-$37 billion. “We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase [in 2025] as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” CFO Susan Li said.\n\nThose huge spending numbers scared investors enough to send shares plunging up to 16% immediately following the release. But Deutsche Bank says shareholders are wrong to fear Meta’s huge wager on AI: its pole position in the advertising game makes it a prime contender to benefit in the long run.\n\n“As the fastest growing ad platform at scale, we argue Meta is actually leaning into Gen AI from a position of strength,” wrote the bank in a research note issued following the earnings release. “Meta is entering an investment cycle. We have been here a couple of times before, and each time it ended the same way...good for Meta's longer-term equity value.”\n\nMeta has already rolled out multiple consumer-facing AI tools, including AI-enabled smart glasses built in collaboration with Ray-Ban and its open-source Llama 3 AI model. But Deutsche Bank says that recommendation algorithms are the place AI is going to make the biggest difference for Meta. Meta’s most popular apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, are already leveraging AI to push customized content into users’ feeds—and they’re all proven profit generators.\n\nDeutsche Bank pointed out that on Facebook, an app typically associated with seeing content posted by a user’s friends, 30% of posts viewed are AI-recommended, and that number rises to 50% for Instagram. Leveraging AI in the Reels algorithm has resulted in users spending 8-10% more time on the app. Given that Meta already has the advertising game figured out for these apps, using AI recommendations to increase the amount of time users are spending on them is a clear path to more revenue.\n\n“AI-driven ranking and targeting improvements continue to boost ad efficiency, while Reels' ad load continues to converge towards that of feed and stories,” Deutsche Bank wrote. “We see Gen AI driving the next leg of growth for Meta by: 1) increasing engagement and use cases for users with products and services such as Meta AI and Agents for creators; 2) unified AI-powered recommendations across apps, which is now driving more than 50% of the content viewed on IG; [and] 3) driving automation for advertisers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors might not see the results immediately, though. Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that \"we’ve historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we’re investing and scaling a new product but aren’t yet monetizing it.” Meta has already poured close to $50 billion into its metaverse initiatives, which have yet to yield any clear benefits. And Meta has signaled it’s still at the early stages of pumping money into its AI plans, meaning investors should brace for more big spending numbers in the future.\n\n“Meta is making bigger investments in AI than we anticipated, which will likely result in capital expenditures being much higher, for far longer,” Deutsche Bank wrote.\n\nIn the long run, though, Deutsche Bank argues that AI’s usefulness for ads, the backbone of Facebook’s business model, positions the investment for big long-term gains.\n\n“Given the reasonable valuation after last night's pullback, strong shareholder return story, and fundamentally better advertising platform that’s gaining share, we argue it's prudent to view the company's growing AI ambitions as a positive,” Deutsche Bank wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "*\n\nMarch PCE data in line with estimates\n\n*\n\nAlphabet jumps on first-ever dividend, $70 bln buyback plan\n\n*\n\nMicrosoft gains after earnings beat estimates\n\n*\n\nIndexes up: Dow 0.59%, S&P 1.19%, Nasdaq 2.09%\n\n(Updates to 2:16 PM ET)\n\nBy Chibuike Oguh\n\nNEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.\n\nInvestors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its $70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped 10.4% to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above $2 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 2.7% after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services.\n\nOther megacap growth stocks also traded higher: Amazon.com and Nvidia rose 3.5% and 5.8%, respectively. However, Meta Platforms, Apple and Tesla were down. On Wednesday, Meta results disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.\n\nEight out of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading higher, led by gains communication services, technology, consumer discretionary and materials. \"The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins,\" said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\"Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing,\" Plumb added.\n\nAt 02:16 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 226.04 points, or 0.59%, to 38,313.61, the S&P 500 gained 59.87 points, or 1.19%, to 5,108.29 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 325.84 points, or 2.09%, to 15,937.60.\n\nU.S. Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.\n\nThe report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.\n\nAfter the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Snap surged nearly 28% after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest was also up 4.1%.\n\nExxon Mobil lost 2.2% after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28% from a year ago.\n\nIntel dropped 9.9% after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.04-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,737 stocks rose and 1,323 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.07-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 77 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and David Gregorio)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Intel CEO confident in its AI future after posting soft guidance",
        "content": "After several steps forward with investors, it's a few steps back for Intel (INTC).\n\nShares of the chipmaker fell 8% on Friday, following several hiccups in its first quarter results and second quarter guidance. While the company's first quarter earnings managed to surpass forecasts by $0.05, its guidance for the rest of the year came below consensus.\n\n\"We have a lot of great things happening in the second half of the year. We feel very comfortable with the outlook we have,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe selling pressure on Intel's stock stems from two areas.\n\nFirst, results for the quarter were constrained by a wafer supply issue that Wall Street failed to properly model.\n\nAnd second, there was some demand softness from customers — which is causing Intel execs to be on the cautious side for the second quarter guidance.\n\nIntel expects second quarter sales of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $13.63 billion. Earnings are projected at $0.10 per share, short of analyst forecasts for $0.24.\n\n\"We believe Intel has a difficult road ahead as the company begins a multi-year transition phase which involves high capital intensity and an ambitious design roadmap with expectations to move through five process node transitions in four years,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note.\n\nRoy maintained a Hold rating on Intel's stock.\n\nThe company's tepid guidance overshadowed a couple of wins in the quarter and in the past two months.\n\nGelsinger noted Intel expects to see more than 40 million shipments of AI PCs in 2024, a slight upgrade from his prior outlook. All of the company's planned chip launches for the year remain on track, Gelsinger added.\n\nIntel recently showcased a range of AI-focused products and services. On display was Gaudi 3, an AI chip for generative AI software that will become available later this year.\n\nThe company has also unveiled its Core Ultra processor, which will target the aforementioned emerging AI PC market. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, holding the \"Gaudi 3\" AI chip, speaks during the 54th Annual Meeting of The Semafor 2024 World Economy Summit in Washington, D.C., on April 17, 2024. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)\n\nAnd it was just last month that Intel won $8.5 billion in grants and another $11 billion in loans from the Biden administration to build semiconductor plants in four states. The build-outs are part of Intel's goal to become a leading maker of chips for other companies, rivaling No. 1 player Taiwan Semiconductors (TSMC).\n\nSaid JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur, \"Although we continue to be impressed by the current execution, the next 12 months will be the most difficult for the team as they will be launching two data center products and two major client products over three new manufacturing technology nodes — however, we believe it will serve as a strong proxy on the team’s ability to execute over the next 3-5 years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe vibe around tech stocks\n\nIntel's below-consensus earnings and tepid outlook arrive as the threat of higher for longer interest rates weighs on once-hot tech stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Building out AI infrastructure can also be more costly than expected, as articulated on first quarter earnings call from Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nSo what's the next move in tech stocks?

        "title": "What the New Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Mean for Travelers",
        "content": "The new Ray-Ban Meta glasses are integrated with AI. Meta\n\nImagine you’re visiting the Colosseum in Rome for the first time, and you want your friends to enjoy the same view through the lenses you’re wearing.\n\nNow that’s possible with updates to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\nThe big tech company said this week that it is updating its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses with voice-activated AI tech that could be useful for travelers.\n\nTravel experts have said since generative AI was first released that it could lead to consumers having high-tech digital travel assistants in their pockets. The AI that powers these glasses is still far from fulfilling that vision, but it offers a new glimpse at how that future could look.\n\nFeatures for Travelers\n\nThat includes the ability for hands-free video calling through WhatsApp and Messenger, enabling users to share their view through the lenses of the glasses.\n\nAnd, the update enables the AI to see and answer questions about what the user can see through the lenses. If the user is traveling in France and needs help translating a menu, the glasses can show the translated text without the need to look at a phone screen, according to Meta.\n\nThe user could also look at a building or monument and ask the glasses for more information about it, or ask about what to do in a new city. The response comes in an audio format or is shown via text that the wearer can see through the lenses.\n\nUsers can also ask the AI to control features, like playing music, or draft a caption for a photo that was just taken with the glasses.\n\nUsers activate the tech by saying, “Hey Meta,” and then ask their question.\n\nTech influencer Cleo Abram posted a paid video in partnership with Ray-Ban and Meta displaying what the glasses can do, shown below.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Ray-Ban | Meta (@raybanmeta)\n\nThe beta version of this technology, called Meta AI with Vision, is available to users in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear. So they have full context on what’s going on around you as they help you with whatever you’re trying to do,” said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, during an investor call this week.\n\nMeta and Ray-Ban released the first version of these smart glasses in March 2022 — a more stylish redo of a similar product that Google stopped making in 2015.\n\nAlong with updated tech, the latest generation includes multiple new styles. The glasses are built with an ultra-wide 12 megapixel camera, speakers, and five microphones, allowing users to take photos and videos that are automatically saved to their connected smartphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpdated AI from Meta\n\nThe AI integrated into the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses comes from Meta’s latest generative AI tech model, called Llama 3.\n\nThe company last week released updated versions of its Meta AI chatbot — accessible through Whatsapp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook — based on the Llama 3 model.\n\nMeta released the first version of its Meta AI chatbot last October.\n\nIn the announcement of its latest version, Meta showed examples of how travelers could use the chatbots, such as asking for recommendations about restaurants, events, and flights.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

Visa’s ability to maintain growth stability despite economic obstacles in specific locations is reflected in its adaptability and resilience in various market scenarios.\n\nMoreover, except for transactions within Europe, Visa’s cross-border volume increased by 16% in constant dollars YOY. Visa’s phenomenal rise in cross-border traffic has demonstrated its strong position in enabling international transactions. Overall, Visa’s revenue diversification and development are facilitated by the notable increase in cross-border travel traffic.\n\nStocks to Get Rich: Enphase (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH) sold 75.5 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries, indicating a growing trend in the use of energy storage technologies. Enphase is a leader in energy storage technology, and the high demand for IQ batteries demonstrates this, as does its capacity to adapt to changing client demands.\n\nFurthermore, Enphase launched the IQ8P Microinverters. This has a 480 W peak output AC power for small-commercial markets across many nations. This new product demonstrates Enphase’s dedication to creating cutting-edge solutions that serve various solar industry niches and open up new development prospects.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Enphase’s revenue mix is 57% U.S. and 43% foreign. Its balanced revenue distribution demonstrates the company’s successful entry into foreign markets. This diversifies its income sources and lessens reliance on any one market. Similarly, in Q1 2024, Enphase had a solid 70% sequential sales gain in Europe.\n\nTo sum up, the company’s success in Europe reflects its ability to successfully enter new markets and take advantage of the rising demand for renewable energy sources.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn terms of manufacturing and wholesale volume, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is still on schedule to produce between 200K and 300K Lithium-Based EVs by 2024. Compared to Q1 2023, the company’s wholesale sales of Lithium-Based EVs increased significantly to 22K in Q1 2024. General Motors’ focus on EV sales and production targets highlights the company’s strategic focus on top-line sustainability in electric mobility.\n\nMoreover, General Motors prepares itself for a long-term lead in the quickly changing automotive sector by investing in the EV transition. During Q1, General Motors saw gains in EV variable profit and EBIT margins both sequentially and annually. These enhancements result from the company’s attempts to expand its EV operations, lower material prices, and increase manufacturing efficiency.\n\nTo conclude, increasing EV profitability helps General Motors boost its competitiveness, quicken market penetration, and promote steady growth in the EV industry.\n\nStocks to Get Rich: Ford (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) has modified its capital expenditures to conform to the changing demand and environment surrounding the deployment of EVs. The business projects capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9 billion in 2024. Its focus is aligning prices with the electric vehicle industry’s consumer expectations.\n\nAdditionally, Ford’s electrification plan heavily emphasizes hybrid cars, and the business has seen a notable increase in the number of hybrid vehicles sold. As of Q1, Ford is the third-largest seller of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market. Its hybrid volume growth may reach 40% in 2024. Thus, Ford’s expanding market share and revenue growth are driven by the growing demand for environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles. This is highlighted by the lead of the company’s hybrid products.\n\nFinally, Ford’s software division has seen significant subscriber growth, with paid customers topping 700,000 and growing by 47% annually. The increase in software subscriptions can be attributed to the increased demand from business clients for Ford’s digital solutions.

By the end of 2024’s first quarter, Boeing had $529 billion in backlogs. Over 5,600 commercial aircraft, valued at $448 billion, are included in this number. Additionally, orders that Boeing has received but has not yet fulfilled are represented in the backlog, giving insight into top-line potential. For Boeing, the backlog is an important indicator of the strong demand for its products in the upcoming years.\n\nMoreover, Boeing secured 125 net orders in the first quarter of 2024, showing that it can get fresh orders. Notable contracts were among these orders: American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) ordered 85 737-10 aircraft, and clients like Ethiopian Airlines ordered 28 777X aircraft. Hence, these orders show that Boeing can still attract clients and increase revenue for all its product categories.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on the list of stocks to get rich is AT&T (NYSE:T). The first quarter saw robust demand for high-speed internet services, as seen in adding 252,000 AT&T Fiber net subscribers. With 17 straight quarters of net additions over 200,000, AT&T Fiber is a major growth driver in the consumer wireline market.\n\nMoreover, consumer broadband revenues increased by 7.7% annually, mostly due to a robust 19.5% growth in fiber revenue. The rise highlights the growing need for high-speed internet services and reflects the potential for AT&T to leverage this trend by providing fiber services. Similarly, Fiber ARPU increased by more than 4% annually. Meanwhile, intake ARPU remained above $70. Therefore, this shows that fiber services are well monetized and emphasizes how important high-speed internet access is to customers.\n\nTo sum up, with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times at the end of March, AT&T has been aggressively cutting its debt. This shows that the corporation is making headway toward attaining its goal of 2.5 times by H1 2025. Hence, this indicates responsible financial management and a dedication to bolstering its balance sheet.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in META, ENPH, and T.

        "content": "Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential\n\nOn Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter.\n\nAs for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20.\n\nDigital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars.\n\nThe Metaverse Continues To Bleed Cash\n\nWith revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nAs for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion.\n\nMeta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments.\n\nMeta bought some time with long-term potential of AI.\n\nAfter a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Tech Bulls Back in Driver Seat After Microsoft and Alphabet Blowouts",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After a tense day of choppy trading on Wall Street, the Big Tech trade is back on in full force.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Alphabet Beats Revenue Estimates as AI Fuels Cloud Growth\n\nResults from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. reassured investors that AI can live up to its reputation as a potent driver of growth and sales, setting the market on a more stable footing after a rocky start to the earnings season. The reports stood in contrast to Meta Platforms Inc., another AI favorite, which tumbled after it gave a weak sales forecast and said it would spend a lot more than expected this year.\n\n“I’m absolutely breathing a sigh of relief, because these are the kinds of big beats we needed to see by big tech for the market to resume its upward trajectory” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors.\n\n“Alphabet and Microsoft cleared a high bar, and this justifies the levels they’ve been trading at. These reports show they’re able to generate strong AI revenue without having to spend a lot more, and they’re much better on the positive side than Meta was on the negative.”\n\nMicrosoft beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, fueled by its AI and cloud offerings, sending shares higher. The rally was even stronger at Alphabet, with the Google parent jumping double digits on strength in its own cloud division and implementing a dividend, as some had anticipated. If premarket gains hold, Alphabet is on track to add more than $230 billion — that would take its market capitalization over $2 trillion, a historic threshold that has been elusive.\n\nWith the gains, both stocks are poised to extend a year-to-date outperformance that has come on the back of AI optimism. Compared with the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 3.6% increase, Microsoft has risen 6.1% as of its last close, while Alphabet is up 12%.\n\nThe reports could ease concerns that prices have gotten ahead of themselves, especially after Meta’s report added fuel to the idea that significant financial contributions from AI could be smaller or further away than expected. Such fears helped sent the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index down as much as 2% on Thursday before rebounding to close with a decline of just 0.6%.\n\nRead more: Microsoft, Alphabet Face a ‘Show Me’ Moment After Meta Misfire\n\nMicrosoft trades at 30.5 estimated earnings, above its long-term average and a premium to the market overall. Alphabet’s multiple is 21.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The results are really strong, and are the kinds of deliverables we need to see to fill in valuations, especially since the megacaps have really driven the market higher over the past year,” said Kevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors.\n\nIn a sign of relief, Amazon.com Inc. followed its cloud peers higher in extended trading, up 2.9%. Apple Inc. rose 0.3%. Both are among the notable companies reporting next week. Nvidia Corp. — the stock most directly tied to AI optimism — doesn’t report until later next month, but it also rose following the megacap reports, which indicated spending on AI would remain robust.\n\nNot all results have been strong, including among companies with AI themes. In addition to Meta, Intel Corp. sank after giving a weak forecast, and the chipmaker said it wasn’t able to meet demand for processors used in new AI-enabled PCs. ServiceNow Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. both fell following their reports.\n\n“The reaction to these earnings results further sort of separate the winners from losers,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research.\n\nSo far this earnings season, 93% of the S&P 500’s tech companies have beaten earnings expectations, though only half have for revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For communications, the sector dominated by Alphabet and Meta, every component has topped on earnings so far, though just 50% have beaten on revenue. For the index overall, the earnings and revenue beat rates stand at 81% and 55%, respectively.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nSnap Inc. offered positive signs that its efforts to revamp its digital advertising business are gaining popularity with marketers — boosting revenue and providing stronger competition with powerhouses Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Intel Corp., the biggest maker of personal computer processors, tumbled in late trading after giving a lackluster forecast for the current period, indicating that it’s still struggling to return to the top tier of the chip industry. Huawei Technologies Co.’s latest smartphones carry a version of the advanced made-in-China processor it revealed last year, independent analysis revealed, underscoring the Chinese company’s ability to sustain production of the controversial chip. Meituan is planning to launch its international food-delivery platform in Saudi Arabia’s capital, making its first move outside of greater China as growth slows in its home market. Rubrik Inc. rose 16% in its trading debut after the cloud and data security startup backed by Microsoft Corp. topped its fundraising goal with a $752 million initial public offering, signaling with two other listings sustained demand for first-time share sales.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nPremarket\n\nRoper\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 24, 2024\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $4.71, expectations were $4.32.\n\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\nKenneth Dorell: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and Metaverse efforts and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3 and our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it.\n\nAnd then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before.\n\nIn terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400 plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks and I expect their models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services and this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\n\nAs we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with reels, stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile and more and I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well.\n\nHistorically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years. On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those. AI is already helping us improve app engagement, which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time. We are seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years and for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended. AI has also been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads. And if you look at our two end-to-end AI powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\n\nWe're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come from the open source community and we're improving cost efficiency as one of the main areas that I expect that open sourcing will help us improve, similar to what we saw with open compute. We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations related workloads on this less expensive stack. And as this program matures over the coming years, we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well. And of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company.\n\nNow in addition to our work on AI, our other long-term focus is the Metaverse. It's been interesting to see how these two themes have come together. This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays. And I still think that that's going to be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product, but now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear, so they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things that you're looking at.\n\nNow one strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as a Family of Apps and Reality Labs were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large parts that way we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that's generated here across both segments, so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales, but all the value flows to a different segment. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with EssilorLuxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors.\n\nSo we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine and in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with the classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time. If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches and that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach of partnering with the leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market. I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest.\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build, for example, a work focused headset, maybe slightly less designed for motion, but may want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop, a fitness focused headset may be lighter with sweat wicking materials. An entertainment focused headset may prioritize the highest resolution displays over everything else. A gaming focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription out of the box. Now to be clear, I think that our first party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone, but I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster. A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nNow in addition to AI and the Metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on some of the most important trends already with WhatsApp growth in the US and AI powered recommendations in our feeds and reels already, but I do want to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full screen video player on Facebook that brings together reels, longer videos and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system. On Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement with reels alone now making up 50% of the time that's spent within the app. Threads is growing well too. They're now more than 150 million monthly actives and it continues to generally be on the trajectory that I hope to see.\n\nAnd of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads. That one was a big deal in my house. All right, that is what I wanted to cover today. I am proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to all of our teams who are driving all these advances and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan.\n\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping reality lab's inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D increased 6% driven mostly by higher headcount related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 16% due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend.\n\nG&A increased 20% as higher legal related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share. Capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were $6.7 billion driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results.\n\nI'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20% and the average price per ad increased 6%.\n\nImpression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85% driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30% driven by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they're not connected to.\n\nThe level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models. Video also continues to grow across our platform and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth and we're progressing on our work to bring together reels longer form video and live video into one experience on Facebook. In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the US and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time. We're also introducing deeper integrations of Generative AI into our apps in the US and more than a dozen other countries.\n\nAlong with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps as well as feed and groups on Facebook. We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in. Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here we continue to advance our understanding of users' preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to.\n\nFor example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time based on our perception of a user's interest in ad content and to minimize disruption from ads as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going forward while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out more broadly last year.\n\nThis new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ad models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models, but also improving ad performance. Another way we're leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign setup process, such as selecting which ad creative to show or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We're seeing growing use of these solutions and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learned to our broader ads investments.\n\nNext, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer term opportunities in Generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our Generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years. Our other long-term initiative that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work.\n\nFor example, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, people in the US and Canada can now use our multimodal meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone. Longer term, we expect Generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products making it easier to develop immersive experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline and we believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\nWe also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the State of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billon. Our guidance assumes foreign currency as a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n20 Countries with the Highest Consumer Spending in the World and\n\n12 Countries with the Largest Slum Population in Europe.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META and Netflix NFLX.\n\nDo Meta & Netflix Present Buying Opportunities?\n\nEarnings season has continued to roll along at a rapid pace, with this week's reporting docket notably stacked. We've heard from several market heavyweights, including Meta Platforms and Netflix.\n\nShares of each faced selling pressure post-earnings, erasing a chunk of the year-to-date gains we've seen from each stock. It raises a valid question – is the selling overdone, or is this a rich opportunity for investors? Let's take a closer look at each company's quarterly release.\n\nNetflix\n\nConcerning headline figures, Netflix posted a 17% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales modestly ahead of the consensus, with both items showing considerable growth from the year-ago periods.\n\nTotal subscribers were reported at 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year. Still, the real surprise in the quarterly release was that the company will no longer report quarterly membership numbers starting next year in 2025 Q1, likely explaining the knee-jerk reaction post-earnings.\n\nNonetheless, Netflix enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period.\n\nEarnings expectations have moved higher following the release, a bullish near-term sign. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe company's growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 50% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. The stock sports a Style Score of 'A' for Growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nTechnology heavyweight Meta Platforms also posted a double beat, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by 9% and posting a modest 0.5% sales surprise. The company's improved operational efficiencies have aided its profitability significantly, with earnings up 80% relative to the year-ago period.\n\nThe sell-off post-earnings can be attributed to Meta's announcement of higher capital expenditures for the current fiscal year, which were raised to a band of $35 - $40 billion (previously $30 - $37 billion). Meta raised its CapEx to accelerate its infrastructure investments for its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap, expecting higher CapEx for next year as well to support its efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts' revisions remain positive, but investors can expect adjustments in the coming days.\n\nStill, the company's advertising business continues to deliver, with average price per ad climbing 6% year-over-year alongside a 20% climb in ad impressions across its family of apps. And to top it off, the company's operating margin moved well higher to 38% (25% previously), reflecting its improved profitability.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is always exciting, with companies finally unveiling what's transpired behind closed doors.\n\nSo far, the period has been primarily positive, with the big banks' results not causing any spooks. Netflix and Meta faced post-earnings selling pressure despite both posting solid quarterly results.\n\nNetflix has seen positive earnings estimate revisions post-earnings, a bullish sign. Meanwhile, higher CapEx for Meta scared off some investors, but the stock remains a prime long-term play for those bullish on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "After surging and sinking following its March IPO, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) stock has continued to experience choppy price performance. However, based on some recent analyst ratings, RDDT is becoming one of the sell-side’s favorite social media stocks.\n\nOver the past few weeks, analysts from Needham and Roth MKM have both issued “buy” ratings on the social platform operator’s shares. Yet while plenty are arguing the bull case for RDDT, one can build a substantial bear case for the stock as well.\n\nAs I argued earlier this month, RDDT at present levels prices-in the potential for further monetization of its platform, and could come under pressure once its IPO lockup expires and major shareholders become able to cash out.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn contrast to this unfavorable risk/return profile, there are several social media stocks that are stronger opportunities. In particular, these three standouts in the space.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) may be in free-fall following its latest quarterly earnings release, but this sell-off could in time prove to be an overreaction. Although the Facebook and Instagram parent delivered disappointing guidance, revenue and earnings beat expectations.\n\nEven as the company plans to ramp-up AI infrastructure spending, which may affect near-term profitability, in the long run this effort could drive the next wave of earnings growth for META stock. That’s not all. Keep in mind too that, considering macro and sector-specific uncertainties, investors have been jittery about big tech stocks.\n\nThese fair weather fans exiting today could end up crawling back into positions when better news arrives and/or market sentiment improves. While the dust may not settle immediately, so tread carefully. However, consider seizing the opportunity with this bona fide “buy the dip” situation if this latest round of weakness continues.\n\nPinterest (PINS) the pinterest (PINS stock) logo on a mobile phone held by a woman\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nMETA’s sell-off has spilled over into other social media stocks. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) is no exception. However, a further slide for shares is making an already reasonably priced social media an even better buy for patient investors.\n\nPinterest’s last earnings release in February may have elicited a negative reaction from the market, but there were some promising takeaways. Namely, a strong indication that the company’s turnaround was starting to take shape. During Q4, monthly active users reached a record high.\n\nRevenue increased by double-digits, and the company reported a big jump in profitability. Between now and 2026, as user growth and improved monetization further enhance the bottom line, annual earnings could reach $2.01 per share, per sell-side forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis in turn may result in a big rebound for PINS stock, due to rising in line with increased earnings, as well as due to multiple expansion.\n\nYelp (YELP) yelp app on a mobile phone with headphones\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for a value play among social media stocks, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is your top choice. While shares in the company, which operates a social media platform featuring local business reviews, have performed well over the past year, they continue to trade at a steep discount to other names in the space.\n\nAt current prices, YELP stock sports a forward multiple of just 12, well below that of peers. Yes, there is some rationale behind YELP’s low valuation. After increasing revenue 12% in 2023, thanks largely to enhancements to its platform, Yelp expects revenue growth to slow down to the mid single-digits in 2024.\n\nHowever, with expectations already set low, the company could wow investors in the coming quarters. Growth could come in higher-than-expected, whether through further platform enhancements, or via increased advertiser demand. As it continues to trade at deep value prices, make YELP a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alphabet Beats Revenue Estimates as AI Fuels Cloud Growth",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. reported first-quarter revenue that exceeded analysts’ expectations, buoyed by growth in its cloud computing unit.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe Google parent generated sales, excluding partner payouts, of $67.6 billion for the three months that ended on March 31, surpassing the $66.1 billion expected on average by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was $1.89 per share, compared with Wall Street’s estimate of $1.53 per share.\n\nThe company also said it would pay a dividend of 20 cents a share, its first ever, and repurchase an additional $70 billion in stock. The shares jumped 13% in extended trading.\n\nLike other Big Tech companies, Alphabet has been plowing money into developing artificial intelligence, a strategy that has helped drive demand for its cloud services, which saw revenue rise 28% in the first quarter. Google is a distant third in the cloud computing market, trailing Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but the company’s prowess in AI could help it close the gap.\n\n“The main thing is, we are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers,” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told journalists on a call. “We saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions.” The Google Cloud results “really reflect broad strength across the industry,” she added.\n\nGoogle has developed much of the underlying technology being used in the AI boom today, and has woven it into products from web search to its suite of enterprise software from Gmail to Google Docs.\n\nYet ever since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was released in late 2022, Google has been battling the perception that it’s lagging behind Microsoft and OpenAI in rolling out new generative AI tools. The arrival of popular chatbots such as ChatGPT — which answers questions in a conversational tone rather than providing lists of links to other websites — has posed a threat to Google’s two-decade stranglehold on search. The company is struggling to compete in generative AI without cannibalizing its core profit machine.\n\nGoogle has marshaled teams across the company to reassert its lead in AI, yet its early efforts have been marred by embarrassing blunders, including a scandal over how its AI model Gemini handled race that forced the company to suspend image generation of people.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shown they are excited about the prospects of AI but want tech companies to continue to focus on revenue and profit in the meantime. Meta Platforms Inc., which competes with Google in AI and also digital advertising, suffered its worst stock decline since October 2022 after reporting that it would spend billions of dollars more this year on AI efforts and projecting weaker revenue for the current quarter.\n\nRead more: Zuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta’s AI Push Spooks Market\n\nGoogle said it spent $12 billion in the first quarter on capital expenditures, mostly through investment in its technical infrastructure such as servers and data centers. Porat said she expects quarterly capex throughout the year to be about or above the same level.\n\nDeveloping tools for generative AI is very expensive, but Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said he is “very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries.” While there are questions about how Alphabet will be able to monetize its AI capabilities, Pichai said he’s “comfortable and confident that we will be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well.”\n\nUnlike Meta, Google’s latest results show that the world’s biggest digital advertising machine is continuing to power growth at the company, thanks to search and YouTube. Search advertising revenue rose 14% to $46.2 billion and remains the core of Google’s very lucrative business. But the company is facing heightened competition there, too.\n\nMeta has been seeding AI tools throughout its advertising business and Snap Inc. has also undergone a total revamp of its ad business to improve ad targeting. The digital ad market is recovering from a post-pandemic slump, buoyed by the Olympics Games this summer, but Google is increasingly vying for those ad dollars with Meta and Snap.\n\n“Google’s core search business also did well, but its future is not assured,” said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. “A verdict is expected in the US DOJ’s related antitrust trial in the coming quarter, and the incorporation of AI-generated components into Google’s main search interface will arguably be the biggest change to the search advertising market since its inception.”\n\nIf consumers gravitate from Google search to the new wave of chatbots, that could imperil the company’s search advertising juggernaut, which is expected to generate nearly $200 billion in revenue this year and the bulk of Alphabet’s profit.\n\nCloud has been a bright spot for Google after it first became profitable early last year. Many young AI startups are founded by former Google employees, creating a strong pipeline of cloud clients.\n\nGoogle Cloud reported sales of $9.6 billion. The unit’s profit was $900 million, well ahead of analysts’ projections of $672.4 million.\n\n“For years, Google Cloud was usually a weak spot during Alphabet’s earnings calls,” said Lee Sustar, a principal analyst with Forrester. “These latest results show that Google Cloud’s AI offerings not only got enterprise customers to take another look, but spend some serious money.” Google Cloud has shown it is a strong unit on its own, without having to rely on revenue from the tech giant’s ad businesses to cover for its operating losses as it has in years past, Sustar added.\n\nDespite the hard questions that AI raises for the search business, “there’s no question, however, that Google’s AI ventures are helping Cloud, which has been a consistent growth driver,” Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nYouTube, the wildly popular video site, reported $8.1 billion in revenue, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $7.7 billion. The unit returned to form last quarter after a series of disappointing results that showed the toll of advertisers’ pullback in spending.\n\n“YouTube, in particular, seems to have benefitted from live sports investments, ad blocking crackdowns, and improvements in Shorts monetization, resulting in its strongest growth rate in two years,” Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nAlphabet’s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences firm Verily, reported $495 million in revenue while losing $1 billion. Investors have closely scrutinized the unprofitable unit for years, and earlier this year the company’s famed moonshot factory, X, shed dozens of jobs as it pivots to focus on spinning out companies.\n\nPorat, who was named Alphabet’s president and CIO last year, is expected to focus more on overseeing these investments after the company hires a new CFO to replace her in that role.\n\nTo free up resources to invest in artificial intelligence, Google has conducted rolling rounds of layoffs that have struck teams including hardware, engineering, and the moonshot lab X. Google reported a total of 180,895 employees, down from 190,711 in the year-ago quarter.\n\n(Updates with comments from CEO, and details on capex)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? $40 billion in capex.\n\nMeta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked an earlier Facebook era, when the social network transitioned to mobile phones, to remind investors that you must first spend money to make money.\n\nZuckerberg was right to remind investors about the concept of, well, investing because after glimpsing the sheer cost of an AI investment spree, Wall Street shoved Meta shares down an elevator shaft.\n\nWhile the News Feed, Reels, and Stories solidified the company's grow first, monetize later playbook, investors are still not fully on board with Zuckerberg's AI gambit.\n\nBy many important measures, Meta delivered a stellar quarter. But investors still recoiled at ballooning expenses and an admission that the company needs several more years before aggressive AI investments become profitable business lines. Capital expenditures are now expected to rise as high as $40 billion for the year, up from a high of $37 billion.\n\nThe check on Zuck's ambitions came as Meta shared a downbeat Q2 forecast. Investors have less patience for Meta's AI outlays when revenue growth isn't accelerating, especially given that it's a dividend-paying company now.\n\nThe rough reception to Meta's earnings provided a mirror image of Tesla's (TSLA) post-report surge. As Elon Musk's marketing alchemy showed earlier this week, a heavy sprinkling of visionary storytelling and market appeasement can mean more than what the numbers say. Where investors looked past Tesla's weakened financials and embraced Musk's latest fantasy, they brushed aside Meta's solid performance and stopped listening.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. He nodded to past transitions in the company's history, describing Meta's AI efforts as a multiyear work in progress.\n\nBut even Zuckerberg acknowledged that Meta's AI development will be a larger undertaking than monetizing Reels and Stories, which began as copycat features, and fed off an existing social media empire.\n\nZuckerberg's attempt to sell the concrete benefits of AI, of making particular the grand aspirations of a supposedly transformational technology, may also make them seem small.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute,\" Zuckerberg touted.\n\nAI curation systems are strengthening the engagement loop of more time on Meta's platforms and the delivery of more ads. In a first for Meta, more than half of the content people see on Instagram is AI recommended.\n\nThat may not be worth $40 billion. But it is something.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Owns All the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. These 3 Are His Favorites.",
        "content": "Few investors deserve the adjective \"legendary.\" Ken Griffin is one of them. He founded Citadel in 1990. It now ranks as the most successful hedge fund of all time.\n\nWith Citadel's portfolio including thousands of holdings, it isn't surprising that Griffin owns all the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. However, three appear to be his favorites.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nCitadel owns a larger position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) than any other individual stock. The only bigger holding for the hedge fund is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. At the end of 2023, Citadel's stake in Nvidia totaled $1.8 billion.\n\nImportantly, Griffin continued to add to Citadel's stake in Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2023. He bought an additional 1.58 million shares, increasing his hedge fund's position in the chipmaker by nearly 77%.\n\nWe can easily guess why the billionaire investor likes Nvidia so much. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have enjoyed staggering demand as organizations scrambled to build, train, and run generative AI applications.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nMicrosoft isn't too far behind Nvidia as the second-largest Magnificant Seven holding for Citadel. However, I wouldn't say the tech giant is Griffin's second-favorite Magnificent Seven stock for a simple reason: He sold nearly 16% of Citadel's stake in Microsoft in Q4. But it's a different story with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAt the end of 2023, Amazon ranked behind Microsoft as Citadel's third-largest individual stock holding. Griffin is clearly bullish about Amazon, evidenced by his increase of Citadel's stake in the stock by almost 223% in Q4.\n\nWhat is so attractive about Amazon? I'd put improving profitability near the top of the list. Griffin also undoubtedly recognizes the tremendous opportunity AI presents for Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Citadel's fifth-largest position excluding the big stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Exiting 2023, Citadel owned 2.46 million shares of the social media giant worth over $869 million.\n\nBefore Q4, Meta wasn't nearly as big of a holding for the hedge fund. Griffin bought 1.37 million shares in the last quarter of 2023, increasing Citadel's stake in Meta by 127%. As was the case for the other top Magnificent Seven stocks, the hedge fund also owned call and put options for Meta.\n\nI think Griffin likes Meta for some of the same reasons he likes Amazon. Meta's bottom line has improved significantly thanks in part to cost-cutting initiatives. The company also should have a major growth opportunity with AI, albeit in some different ways than Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these Magnificent Seven stocks smart picks now?\n\nNvidia, Amazon, and Meta have retreated from their all-time highs in recent weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if they fall further. However, significant pullbacks would create excellent buying opportunities for all three stocks, in my view.\n\nCompetition is increasing in the AI chip market. I don't expect Nvidia to command as formidable a market position going forward as it has so far. On the other hand, the demand for AI chips will almost certainly continue to increase. Nvidia's innovation should keep it on top.\n\nAmazon isn't in danger of giving up its leadership in e-commerce. Its AWS unit might lose market share to other cloud providers, but I still expect it to deliver strong growth as organizations move their apps and data to the cloud. I also look for Amazon to do what it's always done and find new avenues for growth.\n\nMeta has demonstrated the resilience of its social media platforms. AI-powered business messaging could be a key growth driver for the company for years to come. I also like Meta's decision to open up its Horizon virtual reality operating system to third-party device makers.\n\nDoes Ken Griffin still view these Magnificent Seven stocks as good picks? We should find out in a few weeks when Citadel discloses its 2024 first-quarter holdings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Stock market today: Asian benchmarks mostly climb despite worries about US economy",
        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Friday despite worries about the economic outlook and inflation in the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThe Bank of Japan ended a policy meeting with no major changes, keeping its benchmark interest rate in a range of 0 to 0.1%. In March, it raised the key rate from minus 0.1%, citing signs that inflation had reached the central bank’s target of about 2%.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.8% to 37,934.76, while the U.S. dollar edged up to 156.22 Japanese yen from 155.58 yen.\n\nAlthough a weak yen is a boon for giant Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp., whose overseas earnings are boosted when converted into yen, some Japanese officials, including Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, have been raising concern that an overly weak currency is not good for the Japanese economy in the long run.\n\nIn other currency trading, the euro cost $1.0740, up from $1.0733.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.4% to 7,575.90. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.1% to 2,656.33. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 2.3% to 17,680.43, while the Shanghai Composite rose 1.1% to 3,087.60.\n\nOn Thursday, Wall Street was lower with worries about a potentially toxic cocktail combining stubbornly high inflation with a flagging economy. A sharp drop in Facebook’s parent company, one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks, also hurt the market.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 5,048.42. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1% to 38,085.80 and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.6% to 15,611.76.\n\nMeta Platforms, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, dropped 10.6% even though it reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts had expected. Investors focused instead on the big investments in artificial intelligence that Meta pledged to make. AI has created a frenzy on Wall Street, but Meta is increasing its spending as it also gave a forecasted range for upcoming revenue whose midpoint fell below analysts’ expectations.\n\nExpectations had built high for Meta, along with the other “Magnificent Seven” stocks that drove most of the stock market’s returns last year. They need to hit a high bar to justify their high stock prices.\n\nThe entire U.S. stock market felt the pressure of another rise in Treasury yields following a disappointing report that said the growth of the U.S. economy slowed to a 1.6% annual rate during the first three months of this year from 3.4% at the end of 2023.\n\nThat undercut a hope that's sent the S&P 500 to record after record this year: that the economy can avoid a deep recession and support strong profits for companies, even if high inflation takes a while to get fully under control.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's what Wall Street calls a “soft landing” scenario, and expectations had grown recently for a “no landing” in which the economy avoids a recession completely.\n\nThursday’s economic data will likely get revised a couple times as the U.S. government fine-tunes the numbers. But the lower-than-expected growth and higher-than-expected inflation is “a bit of a slap in the face to those hoping for a ‘no landing’ scenario,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\n\nTreasury yields still climbed as traders pared bets for cuts to rates this year by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.70% from 4.66% just before the report and from 4.65% late Wednesday.\n\nTraders are largely betting on the possibility of just one or maybe two cuts to interest rates this year by the Fed, if any, according to data from CME Group. They came into the year forecasting six or more. A string of reports this year showing inflation remaining hotter than forecast has crushed those expectations.\n\nIn energy trading Friday, benchmark U.S. crude edged up 37 cents to $83.94 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 40 cents to $89.41 a barrel.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Japan must implement laws to better regulate companies like Meta Platforms Inc. when they fail to address social media scams, the head of the ruling party’s digital promotion working group said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe country’s lawmakers are demanding a swifter response from Meta’s local unit, as a growing number of online ads featuring celebrity images attempt to swindle people out of their money, former Digital Transformation Minister Takuya Hirai said in an interview. Under consideration is a proposal to summon Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the Diet, he said.\n\nFacebook is home to a disproportionate number of fake ads in Japan, Hirai said. The company’s efforts to rectify the situation are far from enough and the situation is unacceptable, he said. “Meta is the most non-compliant platform owner.”\n\nThe 66-year-old lawmaker said his team will work closely with the Liberal Democratic Party and government officials to step up monitoring of big US tech companies’ operations in Japan and will map out detailed policy options by the end of the current parliament session in June. Hirai also suggested Meta should suspend all Facebook ads until the platform operator finds a better way to combat fraud.\n\nThe growing number of scams has triggered a backlash in a country with a gross savings rate of nearly 30%. Particularly vocal condemnation has come from entrepreneurs Yusaku Maezawa and Takafumi Horie, whose images have often been manipulated by the fraudsters. The two have accused Meta of negligence and have called for stricter regulations.\n\nEarlier this week, four victims sued Meta Japan for damages totaling ¥23 million ($150,000).\n\nThe Menlo Park, California, company said it’s deployed both staff and artificial intelligence software to detect and delete inappropriate ads on its service.

        "title": "Decoding Meta Platforms Inc (META): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc showcases robust revenue growth and solid operational income in its latest 10-Q filing. Despite competitive pressures, META continues to innovate and invest in future technologies, including the metaverse. Brand strength and user engagement remain pivotal to META's sustained market dominance. Regulatory challenges and privacy concerns pose significant threats to META's operational landscape.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\n\nOn April 25, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 10-Q filing, revealing a substantial year-over-year revenue increase from $28,645 million to $36,455 million. This impressive growth is a testament to META's enduring appeal and innovative edge in the social networking domain. The company's net income nearly doubled, surging from $5,709 million to $12,369 million, reflecting META's operational efficiency and strategic prowess. With a user base nearing 4 billion across its family of apps, META's financial health is indicative of its market leadership and potential for future expansion. Decoding Meta Platforms Inc (META): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Power: Meta Platforms Inc's brand is synonymous with social networking, a testament to its pioneering role and continued innovation in the industry. The company's suite of products, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, are household names, commanding a massive and loyal user base. This brand equity translates into significant competitive advantages, such as high barriers to entry for competitors, pricing power, and a strong bargaining position with advertisers and partners. The brand's strength is evidenced by its ability to maintain user engagement despite the emergence of new social media platforms, ensuring a steady stream of advertising revenue, which accounts for over 90% of META's total revenue.\n\nFinancial Robustness: META's latest financials underscore its robust balance sheet and profitability. The company's revenue growth outpaces the increase in total costs and expenses, indicating effective cost management and scalability. With a net income margin improvement from 20% to 34%, META demonstrates its ability to translate top-line growth into bottom-line results. This financial strength provides META with the flexibility to invest in long-term growth initiatives, such as the development of the metaverse, and to weather economic downturns.\n\nInnovation and Diversification: META's commitment to innovation is evident in its significant research and development investments, which totaled $9,978 million in the latest quarter. This focus on innovation not only enhances existing platforms but also drives the development of new technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality. META's diversification into hardware products and its ambitious vision for the metaverse position the company at the forefront of the next digital frontier, potentially unlocking new revenue streams and user engagement opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its financial success, META's heavy reliance on advertising revenue is a vulnerability. With over 90% of its revenue stemming from advertising, shifts in advertiser spending, changes in advertising technology, or the emergence of ad-blocking tools could significantly impact META's financial performance. This dependence on a single revenue stream makes META susceptible to market fluctuations and requires a strategic approach to diversifying income sources.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: META operates in a highly scrutinized regulatory environment, with ongoing concerns around privacy, data protection, and content moderation. The company's business model, which involves the collection and utilization of user data for targeted advertising, is subject to evolving privacy regulations and public sentiment. Compliance with these regulations can be costly and may limit META's ability to leverage its user data for advertising purposes, potentially affecting its revenue and growth prospects.\n\nUser Privacy Concerns: User trust is paramount in the social networking space, and any breach of privacy or data misuse can erode user confidence and engagement. META has faced criticism and legal challenges related to user privacy, which could lead to a loss of users or reduced user activity. Maintaining user trust while balancing the monetization of user data is a delicate and ongoing challenge for META.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: META's global presence offers significant opportunities for growth, particularly in emerging markets where internet penetration is rising. By tailoring its products to local needs and investing in infrastructure to improve access, META can capture a larger share of these growing user bases. The company's ability to scale and localize its platforms can drive user growth and open up new advertising markets.\n\nMonetization of New Technologies: META's investments in the metaverse and virtual reality technologies present substantial opportunities for monetization. As these technologies mature and gain user adoption, META can leverage its first-mover advantage to establish new revenue models, such as virtual goods, services, and experiences. The potential integration of e-commerce and digital payments within the metaverse further expands META's revenue potential.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: META has a history of strategic acquisitions that have bolstered its product offerings and user base. Continued strategic partnerships and acquisitions can enhance META's technological capabilities, expand its product portfolio, and consolidate its market position. Collaborations with content creators, businesses, and technology providers can enrich the user experience and create additional revenue channels.\n\nThreats\n\nIntensifying Competition: The social networking landscape is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for user attention and advertising dollars. META faces competition from platforms that offer similar or alternative services, particularly those that resonate with younger demographics. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to user preferences to maintain its market leadership and avoid losing users to competitors.\n\nRegulatory and Political Scrutiny: META's operations are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny, which can lead to restrictions, fines, or changes in business practices. Political and public pressure around issues such as misinformation, content moderation, and antitrust concerns can result in regulatory actions that constrain META's business model and operational flexibility. Navigating this complex regulatory landscape is critical to META's long-term success.\n\nTechnological Disruptions\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Google\n\nGoogle’s parent company soared past a $2 trillion valuation last night as the search engine giant said it would pay a dividend for the first time.\n\nShares in Alphabet rose by more than 12pc to a record high as the company announced the payout to shareholders, alongside a $70bn (£56bn) share buyback scheme.\n\nMicrosoft shares also rose after the world’s most valuable company revealed record profits. It meant both tech giants shrugged off a tech sell-off earlier in the day triggered by fears about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $80.5bn for the first quarter of the year, a 15pc rise, and said profits had climbed by 57pc to $23.7bn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt said it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, amounting to a payout of more than $2.5bn, and that it planned to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future. It comes after Meta said it would pay its first dividend in February.\n\nMicrosoft shares climbed by more than 5pc after sales jumped on growing demand for its AI technology. Quarterly revenues rose 17pc to $61.9bn while profits were up 20pc, at $21.9bn.\n\nGoogle has faced questions about whether it is falling behind companies such as OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, as well as concerns that the rise of AI could threaten its lucrative search engine.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has been seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ChatGPT craze. It is a major investor in OpenAI and has built the chatbot into many of its own products. It overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable listed company earlier this year.\n\nBut investors had questioned whether the hype and heavy spending around AI is turning into tangible revenues.\n\nThe figures came after a wider tech sell-off earlier in the day after Facebook owner Meta reported disappointing results on Wednesday night. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had fallen by as much as 2pc before a slight recovery.\n\nMeta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth drop by more than $17bn after Meta’s stock plunged by 10pc as investors baulked at his plans to invest billions into AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe billionaire, whose fortune is almost entirely made up of his shares in the company, lost his position as the world’s third-richest person to Elon Musk this week after a leap in Tesla’s shares made a recovery.\n\nMr Zuckerberg is now worth approximately $150bn following a share price rout last night. Mr Musk is worth about $179bn as of yesterday.\n\nMore than $100bn was wiped from Meta’s market value as investors baulked at Mr Zuckerberg’s plans to spend heavily on AI technology.",

        "title": "Meta &amp; Netflix Face Post-Earnings Pressure: A Buying Opportunity?",
        "content": "Earnings season has continued to roll along at a rapid pace, with this week’s reporting docket notably stacked. We’ve heard from several market heavyweights, including Meta Platforms META and Netflix NFLX.\n\nShares of each faced selling pressure post-earnings, erasing a chunk of the year-to-date gains we’ve seen from each stock. It raises a valid question – is the selling overdone, or is this a rich opportunity for investors? Let’s take a closer look at each company’s quarterly release.\n\nNetflix\n\nConcerning headline figures, Netflix posted a 17% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales modestly ahead of the consensus, with both items showing considerable growth from the year-ago periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTotal subscribers were reported at 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year. Still, the real surprise in the quarterly release was that the company will no longer report quarterly membership numbers starting next year in 2025 Q1, likely explaining the knee-jerk reaction post-earnings.\n\nNonetheless, Netflix enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period.\n\nEarnings expectations have moved higher following the release, a bullish near-term sign. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 50% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nTechnology heavyweight Meta Platforms also posted a double beat, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by 9% and posting a modest 0.5% sales surprise. The company’s improved operational efficiencies have aided its profitability significantly, with earnings up 80% relative to the year-ago period.\n\nThe sell-off post-earnings can be attributed to Meta's announcement of higher capital expenditures for the current fiscal year, which were raised to a band of $35 - $40 billion (previously $30 - $37 billion). Meta raised its CapEx to accelerate its infrastructure investments for its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap, expecting higher CapEx for next year as well to support its efforts.\n\nAnalysts' revisions remain positive, but investors can expect adjustments in the coming days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company’s advertising business continues to deliver, with average price per ad climbing 6% year-over-year alongside a 20% climb in ad impressions across its family of apps. And to top it off, the company’s operating margin moved well higher to 38% (25% previously), reflecting its improved profitability.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is always exciting, with companies finally unveiling what’s transpired behind closed doors.\n\nSo far, the period has been primarily positive, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks. Netflix NFLX and Meta Platforms META faced post-earnings selling pressure despite both posting solid quarterly results.\n\nNetflix has seen positive earnings estimate revisions post-earnings, a bullish sign. Meanwhile, higher CapEx for Meta scared off some investors, but the stock remains a prime long-term play for those bullish on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is up from 3.3% the day before.\n\nThe latest estimate is based on results from 190 of the S&P 500 companies and forecasts for the rest, with about 78% of reports beating analysts' earnings expectations.\n\nLSEG noted that the forecast has been impacted heavily by an adjustment for Bristol Myers Squibb because of a $12 billion one-time charge related to its acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics.\n\nWithout that one-time item, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen 7.4% year-over-year, based on LSEG estimates.\n\nStocks were down on Thursday, however, despite the improved outlook for quarterly earnings. Among the biggest drags, Meta Platforms shares\n\nplunged after\n\nthe Facebook-parent late Wednesday forecast higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue.\n\nHoneywell International early on Thursday reported results that beat Wall Street estimates, while General Motors also this week reported better-than-expected quarterly results.

        "content": "*\n\nInterest rate markets digest slowdown in US GDP growth rate\n\n*\n\nMining sector M&A lifts FTSE to all-time high\n\n*\n\nYen drops to latest 34-year low\n\n(Updated at 2:34 p.m. ET (1834 GMT)\n\nBy Chris Prentice and Marc Jones\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Stocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Thursday as disappointing forecasts from Facebook and Instagram owner Meta hammered the tech sector, and Japan's yen sank through 155 per dollar for the first time since 1990.\n\nTepid U.S. GDP data pushed Wall Street lower at its open, and Meta's slump also soured the mood. More Big Tech earnings are scheduled for later in the day.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose after the data showed signs of persistent inflation, lowering hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates anytime soon.\n\nGold trimmed gains.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 4.54 points, or 0.60%, to 754.92 by 2:34 p.m. ET (1834 GMT).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 451.63 points, or 1.17%, to 38,009.29, the S&P 500 lost 33.99 points, or 0.67%, to 5,037.64, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 140.87 points, or 0.90%, to 15,571.44.\n\nIn an earnings-packed week, tech bellwethers are in the spotlight, with Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel due to report after Thursday's closing bell.\n\n\"If Meta is a guide, it seems the market is simply not tolerant of in-line – if you've had a good run through Q1 & Q2 you either blow the lights out, or the market takes its pound of flesh,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\nRobert Alster, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, also noted the comments of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the need to spend to keep up in the AI arms race.\n\nEuropean shares closed down 0.7%, paring losses after shedding more than 1% intraday, hit by bleak earnings from consumer giant Nestle and Dutch digital payments firm Adyen.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 held onto gains, up 0.26% at a record high as UK-listed miner Anglo American surged on a $39 billion buyout offer from Australian rival BHP.\n\nU.S. SLOWDOWN\n\nBeyond corporate earnings, investors were digesting the sharper-than-expected slowdown in first-quarter U.S. economic growth.\n\n\"Despite the expected GDP slowdown in 2024, there are no imminent signs of a recession,\" said Mutual of America Capital Management's chairman and chief executive, Stephen Rich.\n\nHotter-than-expected inflation reports have pushed back and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now pricing in roughly a 70% chance of a first reduction in September. Investors are not even fully convinced there will be another cut this year, having expected around six cuts at the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shifting expectations of U.S. rates have lifted Treasury yields and the dollar, casting a shadow on the currency market. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar ticked fractionally higher to 105.89 after the GDP data.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 5.2 basis points to 4.706%, from 4.654% late on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 6.1 basis points to 4.9975%, from 4.937% late on Wednesday.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.12% against the greenback at 155.53 per dollar and touched its lowest level in 34 years. It is now firmly past the latest line in the sand traders had drawn for Japan to intervene in the markets.\n\n\"Tokyo has still not intervened, and I reiterate that it does look like there will be no intervention so long as USD/JPY's climb continues in a relatively non-volatile fashion,\" said RBC Capital Markets' head of Asian FX strategy, Alvin Tan.\n\nThe Bank of Japan started its two-day rate-setting meeting on Thursday, with expectations that it will keep its key short-term interest rate target unchanged.\n\nAttention will be on what Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda's says about the yen's struggles.\n\nU.S. crude settled up 0.92% to $83.57 a barrel and Brent settled at $89.01 per barrel, up 1.12% on the day.\n\nSpot gold added 0.68% to $2,331.49 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.2% to $2,319.90 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones Editing by Gareth Jones, Elaine Hardcastle and Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Elon Musk And Mark Zuckerberg Never Fought In The Cage, But Zuckerberg Still 'Beat' Musk By Surpassing His Net Worth For First Time In Years\n\nWhile their much-hyped cage match never materialized, the rivalry between Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk continues to play out in the real world — with their net worth acting as the scorecard.\n\nThe executives traded barbs on social media last year, each appearing ready to face off in a physical match until Musk reported needing surgery, putting an end to the planned event.  Zuckerberg landed a metaphorical jab at Musk by surpassing him on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time since 2020.\n\nOn April 5, Bloomberg reported that Zuckerberg became the third-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $186 billion, surpassing Musk, who was fourth on the list with a net worth of $180 billion. The shift is largely the result of the impressive performance of Meta's stock, which has surged about 40% since the start of the year, adding roughly $49 billion to Zuckerberg's wealth. Conversely, Musk has seen his fortune diminish as Tesla’s shares have dropped by 43%, eroding $76 billion from his wealth and marking Tesla as the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Unlock Real Wealth with Cityfunds’ Exclusive 8% Yield Fund.\n\nHowever, as of April 25, the tables have turned again. Musk reclaimed the third spot with Zuckerberg’s net worth dropping to $175 billion. This back-and-forth is likely to continue.\n\nThe setback in Tesla’s stock followed its first year-over-year sales decline since the pandemic and price cuts on several vehicles and its Full Self-Driving software. Despite these challenges, Musk is still attempting to secure a controversial $45 billion pay package, initially valued at $56 billion, that could potentially restore his position above Zuckerberg if approved by shareholders.\n\nThe rivalry between Zuckerberg and Musk has been ongoing. In 2016, a SpaceX rocket explosion destroyed a Facebook satellite aimed at providing internet to sub-Saharan Africa, prompting Zuckerberg to express his deep disappointment.\n\nTrending\n\nWant to Create a Passive Income Stream? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy Grail\n\n“I’m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,” he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nThat event marked a significant point in Zuckerberg and Musk's escalating rivalry, which has since expanded into the realm of social media. Musk has criticized Instagram and WhatsApp for their impacts on users’ mental health and privacy. The competition intensified when Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, leading Zuckerberg’s Meta to launch Threads, a direct competitor to Twitter, signaling a strategic countermove in the ongoing tech titans’ battle.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the lack of a direct confrontation, Zuckerberg’s recent financial gains over Musk indicate that their competitive spirit remains strong, impacting their personal interactions and resonating through their significant business empires.\n\nRead Next:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYou have to spend money to make money\n\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\n\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\n\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\n\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited in the pursuit of AI\n\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\n\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday. Chinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports. The potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. MSFT Chart\n\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI. Investors should ignore the short-term volatility and buy the dip.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 22, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) gained as much as 13% in after-hours trading Thursday, following a stand-out quarter that beat revenue and earnings estimates and stoked investor excitement with the announcement of a cash dividend program of $0.20 per share.\n\nThe board of directors also approved stock repurchases up to an additional $70 billion.\n\n“Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud,\" said CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement. \"Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.”\n\nHere are some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $67.59 billion vs. $66.07 billion expected ($58.07 billion in Q1 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 vs. $1.53 expected ($1.17 in Q1 2023) Cloud revenue: $9.58 billion vs. $9.37 billion expected ($7.45 billion in Q1 2023) Ad revenue: $61.66 billion vs. $60.18 billion expected ($54.55 billion in Q1 2023)\n\nIn artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle has also been working to claim additional share of the cloud market, where it currently sits in third place behind rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet's report arrived a day after its advertising rival and Big Tech peer Meta (META) offered a downbeat Q2 forecast and noted that expenses for the year are growing and that it will take some time before AI investments generate significant revenue.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Though Trump’s social media stock, Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), had an initially compelling value proposition, the intervening years haven’t been kind to the company. Truth Social, the primary social media platform under the broader corporate umbrella, came about as a less censorious alternative to social media companies like X (known at the time as Twitter).\n\nIn the years between its launch and eventual special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger, Elon Musk realigned X into a more widely permissible public forum, and a range of alternative social media venues stepped up to cover other gaps in consumer preference. Unfortunately for shareholders, this leaves Truth Social and Trump Media & Technology in a tricky position moving forward.\n\nTrading at a truly shocking 700x revenue with rapidly dwindling download rates, Truth Social is far from the top pick among alternative social media stocks in today’s market — but these three may offer improved prospects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRumble (RUM) In this photo illustration the Rumble logo seen displayed on a smartphone. RUM stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) is the social media stock most directly analogous to Truth Social. Branding itself as a YouTube alternative that platforms alternative political pundits alongside more mundane (and traditional) video fare means that Rumble can target multiple consumer swaths. By including disenfranchised mainstream platform refugees alongside more mainstream watchers diversifying their viewing habits, Rumble narrowly targets both sales streams in a recipe for success as the social media stock grows.\n\nRumble’s multi-niche targeting plan is already bearing fruit a few months after closing a deal with Barstool Sports to offer viewers a full range of the sport site’s video content alongside advertising opportunities for both parties. Rumble’s performance is improving across multiple indicators, including monthly active users, active live viewership, and app downloads. Likewise, the company’s end-of-year revenue more than doubled in 2023 compared to 2022. We’ll need to wait a few weeks before Rumble posts first-quarter financials. Still, if other leading indicators prove reliable, investors should expect big things from this social media stock moving forward.\n\nBraze (BRZE) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSocial media advertising technology is undergoing a silent but steady series of transformations as digital consumer trends evolve and influencer or creator-centric media replaces legacy fare like cable. While venture capital continues to flow into private adtech companies, publicly-traded Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) stands out as an up-and-coming social media stock perfectly positioned to capitalize on these emerging marketing trends. Braze helps brands to manage multichannel marketing across all major digital platforms with a fresh and unique approach.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike legacy adtech companies that target consumer segments with aggressive campaigns, Braze navigates consumer engagement more effectively. It manages curated journeys accompanying users across platforms, providing a personalized and unique experience. This personalization fosters a mental connection between the user and the brand, often converting potential customers quickly. This effectiveness is why prominent names like Match (NASDAQ:MTCH), NASCAR, and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) take advantage of Braze’s unique services.\n\nBraze isn’t yet profitable and admittedly trades at a premium, though far less overvalued than Trump Media & Technology, considering it trades at “just” 8x sales. Still, Braze is a leader in emerging advertising trends, and early entrants like Braze often need a bit of time to build momentum and generate word of mouth among top-dollar corporate clients.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough a far cry from alternative social media stocks, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is rapidly right-sizing operations and, by watching X’s growth post-Musk, may be positioning itself to realign company values with changing consumer preferences for freer speech and greater diversity of opinion. Though often tagged as a platform for Boomers, Meta is on track to remain dominant among Gen Z audiences, which may increase further as TikTok’s short-term future comes into question.\n\nWhile Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse vision has faced delays, shifting towards virtual reality as a staple in future digital and social interactions seems inevitable. Despite a dip in interest in metaverse-style fashion shows and real estate ventures due to technological and accessibility challenges, demand in this sector is steady (if not spectacular). To that end, Meta’s metaverse initiative stands poised to dominate the burgeoning social media landscape even if initial rollout operations were a bit premature.\n\nWhen you add its forward-thinking outlook to its existing base of over 10 million active advertisers who pay premium rates for visibility on users’ feeds, Meta clearly ranks as a top social media stock to anchor a diversified portfolio including other, alternative social media offerings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in RUM.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Dips present long-term buying opportunities for investors who can wait for conditions to improve. Some corporations exhibit stock price declines due to temporary industry-specific headwinds or macroeconomic headlines.\n\nGrowth stocks have the potential to outperform the market, but those great expectations also come with heightened volatility. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are both still up year-to-date, but both of these indices have been sliding to start the second quarter. Things can get worse before they get better, but these growth stocks offer enticing opportunities for investors who can look to 2030 and beyond.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to expand its lead in the artificial intelligence race. The company also has dominant positions in the cloud computing, gaming, advertising, and business software industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts can’t get enough of the stock and believe that it has a 19% upside from the current price. Microsoft is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.” Financials came in good in Q2 FY24 as the company reported 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 33% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nMicrosoft has plenty of opportunities to generate higher growth rates and reward investors with steady cash flow. The stock has been shedding some of its gains since April and is approaching correction territory. The development has brought Microsoft below the $3 trillion valuation. Shares now trade at a 36 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% dividend yield. Long-term returns have been good as the stock has more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a promising semiconductor stock that is in the middle of a correction. Shares are down by roughly 15% from their all-time highs and currently trade at a 57 P/E ratio.\n\nThe chipmaker has exhibited impressive growth rates to warrant the valuation. The firm reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth and 65% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nSynopsys looks ready to gain market share through its pending acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Once Synopsys clears regulatory hurdles, the two companies will join forces in a move that can reward long-term investors.\n\nSynopsys is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 10 analysts with an average price target of $630 per share. This price target suggests a 23% upside from the current price. The stock has received recent price targets above the average, with one target as high as $675. This price target implies a 32% gain from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s leading online marketplace that generated $574.8 billion in net sales in full-year 2023. That’s a 12% year-over-year increase. Amazon accelerated sales growth in Q4 2023 by posting 14% year-over-year growth during that timeframe. Success with domestic and international markets contributed to $170.0 billion in total Q4 2023 revenue.\n\nThe company continues to grow in multiple verticals. E-commerce is the company’s biggest growth engine, but Amazon Web Services, advertising, and streaming are also key contributors with immense potential.\n\nAmazon is approaching correction territory like many large-cap tech stocks. The company’s improving profit margins and declining P/E ratio can make it a pick to consider for long-term investors. The tech giant has the largest market share in cloud computing and looks poised to strengthen its profit margins in the coming quarters. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe that it can deliver a 21% upside from current levels. The stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.”\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website.

The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” with the highest price target of $435 per share suggesting a 54% upside.\n\nThe company’s Falcon Platform has become an essential resource for many business owners who want to keep their companies and stakeholders safe from cyberattacks. Hackers can do a lot of damage if they infiltrate systems and access sensitive data and documents. Most companies don’t want to take that risk and prefer to invest in cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe dynamic has worked well for Crowdstrike which recently delivered record profitability and sales. Total revenue reached $845.3 million in Q4 FY24. It’s a 33% year-over-year increase. Annual recurring revenue jumped by 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion. Rising profit margins can make the 75 forward P/E ratio more manageable.\n\nThe stock is in the middle of a correction and has dropped by more than 10% since the start of April. This development can increase the stock’s appeal for investors who are window shopping.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) delivers impressive growth rates across the board. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year in Q4 2023 while daily and monthly active users increased by 65% and 46% year-over-year respectively. The language learning app now has 88.4 million monthly active users and closed the quarter with $12.1 million in net income. That’s a big change from the $13.9 million net loss posted in the same period last year.\n\nThe educational tech company has a lot going for it in the long run, but investors have to contend with a 122 forward P/E ratio. The stock’s current correction can help, especially if it gets deeper. Equities have had a rough start to the second quarter, but investors who have 10-year time horizons may be able to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nDuolingo’s 51% year-over-year increase in total bookings suggests that the strong financial results can continue. Analysts also feel optimistic and believe the stock has a 24% upside from current levels. Duolingo is currently rated as a “Moderate Buy.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a projected 14% upside and a “Strong Buy” rating amid a correction. The company continues to attract new users and reported an 8% year-over-year increase in daily active users.\n\nUser growth contributed to the company’s record earnings. Revenue grew by 25% year-over-year to reach $40.1 billion in Q4 2023. Net income more than tripled during the same period to reach $14.0 billion. The significant profit margin expansion prompted the company to establish its first quarterly dividend. The dividend is low at just $0.50 per share each quarter, but investors should expect the company to hike the dividend by 10% or more for several years.\n\nMeta Platforms is the leading social media giant and generates most of its revenue from advertisements. Adventures into artificial intelligence and virtual reality can create additional revenue streams for the company.\n\nGuidance also came in pretty good. The company anticipates Q1 2024 revenue to range from $34.5 billion to $37.0 billion. Meta Platforms generated $28.6 billion in Q1 2023. The company’s guidance for Q1 2024 implies a year-over-year growth rate ranging from 20.6% to 29.4%.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the few fairly valued growth stocks remaining. The valuation isn’t just based on what the company can become, but it’s already reasonable given the firm’s current financials.\n\nThe stock trades at a 20 P/E ratio and offers a 1.22% dividend yield. The P/E ratio is lower than most credit and debit card peers. American Express also has a higher yield than most of its competitors and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nAmerican Express got investors excited with impressive financial results in Q1 2024. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. That’s within the company’s range of 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026.\n\nThe fintech firm shined with net income surging by 34% year-over-year. Diluted EPS jumped by 39% year-over-year while American Express suggested a growth rate in the mid-teens beyond 2026. American Express is also experiencing heightened demand from younger generations. 60% of the company’s new cardholders are Gen Z or Millennial customers.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, SNPS, and AMZN.

        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\n(Reuters) - Investors appear to be losing patience with Big Tech's prodigious artificial intelligence investments this week after Meta Platforms signaled deeper spending and a long road to profitability.\n\nThe concession from Meta in its quarterly report late on Wednesday cast a cloud over Microsoft and Alphabet, which will both report quarterly earnings on Thursday.\n\nMeta's stock sank 15% in extended trade after it forecast higher AI spending next year, while Microsoft was down 2%, Alphabet fell 3% and Nvidia dropped 1.4% in reaction.\n\nWall Street's heavyweight tech-related companies have been locked in a fierce battle to advance generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech.\n\nDuring Meta's earnings conference call, analysts peppered CEO Mark Zuckerberg with questions about how the company was pacing its AI investments. One analyst asked whether Meta was spending more because it saw an even bigger opportunity from AI.\n\n\"I think we've gotten more ambitious and optimistic on AI,\" Zuckerberg responded, pointing to Meta's recent launches of new AI models. \"So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\"\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft both said earlier this year when they reported fourth-quarter results that they expected rising AI costs. The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\n\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\n\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\n\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\n\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\n\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin; additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

They are not even fully convinced there will now be another one this year, having expected around six cuts at the start of the year.\n\nThe shifting expectations of U.S. rates have lifted Treasury yields and the dollar, casting a shadow on the currency market. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was little changed at 105.75.\n\nThe Japanese yen, which is sensitive to U.S. Treasury yields, has felt the brunt of the dollar's ascent and is down 9% this year, the worst performing G-10 currency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Thursday, the yen was fetching 155.65 per dollar after touching 155.675, its weakest in 34 years, during the Asian session. It is also past the 155 yen level that some traders had marked as the latest line in the sand for Japan to act.\n\n\"Tokyo has still not intervened, and I reiterate that it does look like there will be no intervention so long as USD/JPY's climb continues in a relatively non-volatile fashion,\" said RBC Capital Markets' head of Asian FX strategy, Alvin Tan.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) started its two-day rate-setting meeting on Thursday, with expectations that it will keep its key short-term interest rate target unchanged.\n\nAttention will be on what BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's says about the yen's struggles. Ueda will want to avoid any repeat of an episode in 2022, when remarks by his predecessor triggered a big yen tumble that forced Tokyo to spend an estimated $60 billion trying to stabilise it again.\n\n\"At this stage, if they were to intervene, they might as well just throw their money into the sea,\" said Rob Carnell, head of Asia-Pacific research at ING. \"For all the good it will do, except in the very short run.\"\n\nIn the commodity markets, U.S. crude rose 0.1% to $82.89 per barrel and Brent was at $88.13, up 0.12% on the day. Gold, which hit a record high earlier this month, inched up to $2,326 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones Editing by Gareth Jones)\n\nView comments",

A: Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Meta Platforms, Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO: The investment cycle for AI and Reality Labs could span several years, similar to past cycles with Stories and Reels.

        "content": "(Updates at 0510 GMT)\n\nBy Ankur Banerjee\n\nSINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Thursday as disappointing earnings forecasts from Facebook parent Meta Platforms hammered tech shares, while the yen's slump past 155 per dollar for the first time since 1990 raised the spectre of intervention from Tokyo.\n\nA 15% dive in shares of Meta in extended trading after the Instagram parent forecast lighter-than-expected current quarter revenue and higher expenses soured the mood, sparking a sell-off in U.S. tech and tech-related stocks.\n\nThe hit to Asian tech stocks took MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei slid 2%.\n\nThe listless mood is set to continue in Europe, with Eurostoxx 50 futures down 0.12%, German DAX futures down 0.14% and FTSE futures 0.06% lower.\n\nIn an earnings-packed week, tech bellwethers are in the spotlight, with Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel due to report on Thursday.\n\n\"If Meta is a guide, it seems the market is simply not tolerant of in-line – if you've had a good run through Q1 & Q2 you either blow the lights out, or the market takes its pound of flesh,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\nEuropean earnings is also under way, with banking firms Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas SA, Barclays PLC due to report on Thursday.\n\nTech stocks had gotten a boost on Wednesday after Tesla said it would introduce \"new models\" by early 2025 using its current platforms and production lines.\n\nBeyond corporate earnings, investor focus will be on the first quarter U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, for March on Friday.\n\nA hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates, with markets pricing in a 70% chance of the first cut coming in September, CME FedWatch Tool showed.\n\nTraders are pricing in 43 basis points of easing in 2024, drastically less than the 150 basis points they anticipated at the start of this year.\n\nThe shifting expectations of U.S. rates have lifted Treasury yields and the dollar, casting a shadow on the currency market. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was little changed at 105.75. The index is up over 4% this year.\n\nThe yen, which is sensitive to U.S. Treasury yields, has felt the brunt of the dollar's ascent and is down 9% this year, the worst performing G-10 currency.\n\nOn Thursday, the yen was fetching 155.65 per dollar after touching 155.675, its weakest in 34 years during the session, past the 155 yen level that some traders had marked out as a line in the sand that would prompt Tokyo to take action.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) started its two-day rate-setting meeting on Thursday, with expectations that the central bank will keep its short-term interest rate target unchanged.\n\nAttention will be on BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments on Friday as he tries to maintain a calibrated path to exiting ultra-easy rates without upending the currency.\n\nThe BOJ chief will be mindful of avoiding the episode of 2022, when his predecessor's dovish remarks triggered a yen plunge that forced Tokyo to intervene, selling an estimated $60 billion to defend the yen.\n\n\"At this stage, if they were to intervene, they might as well just throw their money into the sea,\" said Rob Carnell, head of Asia-Pacific research at ING. \"For all the good it will do except in the very short run.\"\n\nKieran Williams, head of Asia FX at InTouch Capital Markets, said the dollar/yen pair looks to be trading roughly in line with relative interest-rate spreads, suggesting Japan's Ministry of Finance would be fighting strong headwinds.\n\nThe nation's ruling party is not yet in active discussion on what yen levels would be deemed worth intervening in the market, though the currency's slide towards 160 to the dollar could prod policymakers to act, party executive Takao Ochi told Reuters.\n\nU.S. crude rose 0.1% to $82.89 per barrel and Brent was at $88.13, up 0.12% on the day.

        "title": "Up 6,326% Since IPO, Is It Too Late to Buy MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Stock?",
        "content": "One of the most popular tech stocks in the last decade is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), a Latin American company. MELI stock went public in August 2007. Since then, it has returned a staggering 6,326%, outpacing the broader markets by a wide margin. It means a $500 investment in MELI stock just after its IPO would be worth over $31,200 today. Comparatively, the S&P 500 (SPX) would have turned $500 into $2,386 after adjusting for dividends since August 2007. But does this mean it’s too late to buy MELI stock now?\n\nWhile MercadoLibre will not be able to replicate its historical returns, I’m bullish on the stock due to its widening portfolio of solutions, earnings growth profile, and reasonable valuation.\n\nAn Overview of MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America based on the number of orders and unique visitors. A Brazil-based company, it has a presence in 17 other countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, Chile, and Peru. MercadoLibre is valued at $70.7 billion.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and caters to a region with more than 650 million people. Its fintech platform, MercadoPago, offers a diverse range of fintech products, such as debit cards, online payments, credit lines, savings, insurance, and investments.\n\nHow Did MercadoLibre Perform in Q4 of 2023?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment, MercadoLibre reported revenue of $4.26 billion in Q4 of 2023, an increase of 42% year-over-year. In fact the company’s top line grew at the fastest pace since Q3 of 2022. Its adjusted net income stood at $572 million, indicating a healthy margin of 13.2%.\n\nMercadoLibre reported gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $13.5 billion as growth in items sold rose to 29%, the highest in over two years. The e-commerce giant attributed its GMV growth to strong demand from Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\nThe expansion of its fulfillment network meant that MercadoLibre carried roughly 50% of its shipments in Q4 of 2023, a new record. It also delivered 122 million packages on the same or next day, an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nIn the Fintech business, MercadoLibre’s total payment volume, or TPV, touched $56.5 billion. It emphasized that off-platform TPV growth accelerated in key markets, growing by triple-digit rates. Moreover, it ended 2023 with a credit portfolio of $3.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year.\n\nA Focus on Consumer Electronics and AI\n\nMercadoLibre emphasized that the Consumer Electronics (CE) segment is its largest single online category in Latin America. To gain traction in this segment, it leverages technology to manage pricing, inventory, and supplier relationships. While MercadoLibre provides competitive offers in this category, it continues to grow margins in the Consumer Electronics vertical, allowing it to push harder for growth. For instance, during the Black Friday promotional campaign, the CE category grew by 140% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, MercadoLibre launched capabilities to enable sellers to create their own promotional coupons and answer buyers’ questions quickly due to its AI-powered platform. MercadoLibre also launched a new affiliates program and ramped up short-form videos to expand social media tools that drive traffic to seller listings.\n\nIts widening capabilities meant that MercadoLibre shipped 650 million items in 2023, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Further, the e-commerce giant believes investments in its fulfillment infrastructure should improve the value proposition for buyers and sellers.\n\nOnline Ads Will be a Key Revenue Driver\n\nSimilar to Amazon, MercadoLibre is well positioned to drive top-line growth due to digital ad sales, which is a high-margin business. Currently, Amazon is the third-largest digital ad platform in the world, after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn 2023, MercadoLibre relaunched its ads tech stack. It launched an automated buying platform for display ads while providing live reports and other insights to advertisers. Its tech stack for ads also includes a feature for agencies to manage multiple brands on the platform.\n\nFinally, the company launched Mercado Play, an ads-based streaming platform that operates on a revenue share model with studios. MercadoLibre is offering free content to users, as it unlocked a new revenue stream for the ads business.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for MELI Stock?\n\nOut of the 12 analyst ratings given to MELI stock, 10 are Buys, two are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MELI stock price target is $1,935.45, indicating upside potential of 41.3% from current levels.\n\nWall Street expects MercadoLibre to increase its revenue from $14.47 billion in 2023 to $17.7 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $19.46 per share in 2023 to $32.98 per share in 2024. So, priced at 41.5 times forward earnings, MELI stock might seem expensive, given that the sector median multiple is much lower at 14.9x. However, MELI is on track to grow the bottom line by 72.5% this year, so it deserves a premium valuation.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMercadoLibre’s expanding portfolio of products enables the company to unlock additional revenue streams while contributing to earnings growth. Its broadening base of customers and robust ecosystem of online solutions position the firm to benefit from secular growth trends in the upcoming decade. Basically, MELI is a fast-growing large-cap stock that looks poised to beat the broader markets in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

All eyes now will be on European tech stocks\n\nEarnings from Intel, Alphabet and Microsoft will probably paint a fuller picture of how firms are faring in the AI race.\n\nAn earnings-filled Thursday awaits traders in Europe, with banking firms in the spotlight, while yen watchers keep looking around for a possible intervention now that the currency has breached past the psychologically key 155 per dollar level.\n\nDeutsche Bank, BNP Paribas SA and Barclays Plc are due to report their earnings and the focus will be on their net interest margin especially with interest rates in Europe and UK priced to fall in the second half of the year.\n\nTurkey's central bank will not trim its policy rate from the current 50% until the fourth quarter, a Reuters poll of economists showed.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg warns of stock volatility as Meta bets billions more on AI investment ‘before we make much revenue’",
        "content": "Brace for turbulence, and have patience. That was Mark Zuckerberg's message to Meta shareholders on Wednesday as he explained his decision to plow tens of billions of dollars into a multi-year AI spending spree that will precede any meaningful payoff.\n\nThe cofounder and CEO of Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, said that he'd recently become more optimistic about the company's prospects to dominate the highly competitive market for generative AI services, and that he'd concluded that \"it makes sense to go for it.\"\n\nThat may not sit well with investors, Zuckerberg acknowledged during the company's first quarter earnings call —and shares of Meta were down by more than 15% after hours as he spoke. \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nMeta said Wednesday that the capital expenditures to power its AI ambitions could total $40 billion this year, up to $5 billion more than it had earmarked in October. And costs will only go up in the years to come, the company said. \"This is likely going to take several years,\" he said.\n\nBut Zuckerberg also made a point to note that \"smart investors\" will recognize the opportunity at hand and be patient. After all, the company has been through this before, he said, pointing to investments in products like Reels and Stories that have since paid off.\n\nThe direct appeal to Wall Street for patience underscores the risk of the AI arms race that Meta is committing itself to. Microsoft reportedly plans to spend up to $100 billion to build a specialized AI datacenter with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. And Google-owner Alphabet has been investing heavily in AI for years.\n\nWhile Google and Microsoft both have cloud businesses that serve as vehicles to monetize their AI investments, Meta is not in the cloud business. But Zuckerberg hinted that charging for \"compute\" could be one avenue for generating revenue from its AI technology, along with its traditional advertising business.\n\nZuckerberg ascribed his increasing confidence in Meta's AI prospects to the company's recently released Llama 3 large language model, and the technology's consumer version of it, dubbed Meta AI in a few countries. Tens of millions of people have already tried Meta AI, Zuckerberg said, and the company is planning to roll it out to more users in the coming months.\n\nMeta doesn't generate any direct revenue when users interact with Meta AI right now, but Zuckerberg repeatedly pointed to the company's track record of monetizing its products when they reach sufficient scale—he just didn't say when that moment would be.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What we've shown now is we have the ability to build leading models in our company so I think it makes sense to go for it. And we're going to. And I think it's going to be a good long term investment.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. increased its spending estimates for the year and projected second quarter sales that were below Wall Street’s expectations, once again raising questions about whether its futuristic technological bets will eventually pay off for investors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Biden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Tech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta’s Outlook: Markets Wrap Tesla Soars as Musk’s Cheaper EVs Calm Fears Over Strategy\n\nThe Facebook parent reported revenue of $36.5 billion in the first quarter, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion or earnings per share of $4.71.\n\nBut the Menlo Park, California-based social networking company also projected second quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts expected $38.2 billion. At the same time, Meta raised its expected costs for the year, and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier this year, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\n“We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nThe shares tumbled 11% in extended trading. The stock was up 39% so far this year at market close and has been trading near all-time highs for the past month, in part reflecting excitement around AI.\n\nMeta has been spending aggressively to compete on AI against other tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., which is driving some of the increase in costs. The company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.\n\nIn the previous quarter, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a $50 billion stock buyback in addition to the company’s first ever quarterly dividend, an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company’s aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to pay off. Zuckerberg has spent years plowing money into efforts to build the so-called Metaverse, a virtual world where he hopes people will one day play and work.\n\nStory continues\n\nReality Labs, the Meta division focused on its futuristic bets, reported a loss of $3.85 billion for the first quarter, roughly the same as a year ago. That division, which also oversees VR headsets and Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported an annual loss of more than $16 billion in 2023.\n\nThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.\n\nMeta’s mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the US. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta’s advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.\n\n(Updates with CFO comments in fourth paragraph.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian equity markets were poised to open lower after Meta Platforms Inc.’s disappointing outlook raised concern on whether the industry that has powered the bull market in equities has run too far.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta’s Outlook: Markets Wrap Meta Projects Higher Spending in Deeper Push Into AI Biden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn\n\nFutures for benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong declined, while US stock contracts sank in early Asian trading. Australian financial markets are shut for a holiday. The yen was little changed after weakening beyond 155 per dollar for the first time in more than three decades on Wednesday.\n\nIn late US trading, a $250 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (ticker: QQQ) as the Facebook parent tumbled more than 15%. Meta projected second-quarter sales that were below analyst expectations and increased its spending estimates for the year.\n\nRead more: Meta Sinks on Revenue Guide and Spending Plans: Street Wrap\n\n“Meta’s resources are vast, but not infinite,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc. “The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what’s spooking markets.”\n\nIn the run-up to the results, the S&P 500 struggled to gain traction, hovering near 5,070 as traders positioned for economic data that will help shape the views on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Treasury 10-year yields rose four basis points to 4.64%.\n\nThe Facebook parent reported revenue of $36.5 billion in the first quarter, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion.\n\n“We encourage investors to focus on the positives,” said Tejas Dessai at Global X ETFs. “The company’s fundamentals continue to show strength, and that’s the key story.”\n\nTo Mark Hackett at Nationwide, while the cohort of seven tech megacaps has done well in the last two years because of their superior earnings growth relative to the broader market, this advantage could decrease in 2024 and even more significantly in 2025.\n\n“The ‘Magnificent Seven’ are not nearly as powerful as they once were,” Hackett said. “We see this as a positive development for investors looking to diversify away from the recent market leaders.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMeantime, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicator is flashing a resounding buy signal in US stocks, after it hit a threshold that typically precedes better-than-average gains.\n\nThe bank’s US Tactical Positioning Monitor hit a level that reflects an “attractive set-up” for the S&P 500, according to a team led by Andrew Tyler, JPMorgan’s head of US market intelligence.\n\nThe stock gauge has historically gained around 3% in the subsequent 20 days after a similar four-week change in positioning, compared to a roughly 1% gain in all periods, according to the note.\n\nFor weeks, traders have been scaling back how many rate cuts they expect from the Fed amid a string of resilient economic data. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict gross domestic product likely cooled to around 2.5% in the first quarter, with the figures still potentially suggesting persistent inflationary pressures.\n\n“Tomorrow’s pivotal GDP report comes as market participants hope for a soft number that would lead to rate cuts sooner rather than later,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “We expect a stronger-than-projected figure. It would be great for revenue growth prospects, but bad for the timing and extent of rate cuts.”\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. posted earnings that disappointed investors as the company’s consulting unit continues to see weak demand. It also announced the acquisition of software firm HashiCorp Inc. Ford Motor Co., rapidly retooling its electric vehicle strategy in a decelerating market for plug-ins, posted first-quarter results that beat expectations on strong sales of work trucks. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. raised its full-year outlook as limited-time offers such as chicken al pastor helped boost demand, continuing a streak of positive results as other chains struggle to boost diner traffic. Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun said the embattled planemaker is making progress toward turning around its manufacturing and that it will hit its mid-decade cash-flow goal, even after reporting a major outflow in the first three months of the year it slows output. BHP Group Ltd. is considering a potential takeover of Anglo American Plc, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would rank as one of the year’s biggest deals. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.’s investments into artificial intelligence startups will get deeper scrutiny from the UK’s antitrust watchdog.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nUS GDP, wholesale inventories, initial jobless claims, Thursday Microsoft, Alphabet, Airbus earnings, Thursday Japan rate decision, Tokyo CPI, inflation and GDP forecasts, Friday US personal income and spending, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday Exxon Mobil, Chevron earnings, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.6% as of 7:46 a.m. Tokyo time.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) came out with quarterly earnings of $4.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.32 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.03%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this social media company would post earnings of $4.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.33, delivering a surprise of 10.35%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMeta Platforms , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $36.46 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $28.65 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMeta Platforms shares have added about 40.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Meta Platforms?\n\nWhile Meta Platforms has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Meta Platforms: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.79 on $38.54 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $20.18 on $160.11 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dayforce (DAY), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 1.\n\nThis provider of human-resources software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +45.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDayforce's revenues are expected to be $426.15 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The unwavering pursuit of stocks to make you a millionaire is both exhilarating and challenging. Identifying these superstar stocks requires a keen eye for spotting trends, understanding key financial metrics and being patient.\n\nThese unique companies possess a rare combination of visionary leadership, disruptive innovation and solid fundamentals. Additionally, they are at the forefront of emerging trends in artificial intelligence, fintech and human capital management. While there is no guarantee of achieving this highly coveted financial status, careful selection can put you on the path to riches.\n\nNow, let’s discover the best superstar stocks to make you a millionaire by 2035!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), formally known as Facebook, is a tech behemoth that needs little introduction. The company has shaped the social media landscape and owns notable brands like WhatsApp and Instagram. Additionally, it is a leader in the AI revolution with a notable catalyst upcoming later this year.\n\nOver the last decade, Meta has shown a willingness to adapt and an unwavering focus on technological innovation. While the company’s metaverse bets have yet to pay off, the company is embracing the proliferation of generative AI and LLMs. Investors are excited about the growth prospects of its LLM Llama 3, on pace to debut sometime in July of this year. That will be a huge milestone for the company, allowing it to compete directly with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini models. Moreover, the company is coming off a transformative year in FY23, as cost-cutting drove record revenue and FCF from operations. When considering the best stocks to make you a millionaire in 2024, Meta should certainly be the first place to look.\n\nPaychex (PAYX) Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhone\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a leader in payroll processing and human resource solutions for businesses of all sizes. It might not be as flashy as Meta, but it has a solid track record of consistent revenue growth and profitability.\n\nPaychex makes a compelling investment case for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the outsourcing of payroll and HR tasks is inevitable for nearly every business whether big or small. That allows them to save time and focus on more important aspects of the business like growing revenue and delivering the products and services that their customers need. Secondly, the company has proven adept at integrating new technologies, including cloud solutions and AI for better onboarding experiences. In its latest quarterly results, revenue increased 4% YOY to $1.44 billion. EPS rose 7% to $1.38 per share, with continued operating margin expansion in the quarter. Moreover, the company announced the succession of new AI models, set to bolster customer retention and further optimize its pricing strategies.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiserv (FI) Online banking businessman using smartphone with credit card Fintech and Blockchain concept\n\nSource: Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiserv (NYSE:FI) is an under-the-radar fintech company that investors continue to gloss over. However, the company is currently in a hyper-growth phase and is set to deliver another year of strong double-digit growth in revenue and EPS in FY24.\n\nFiserv is a financial technology powerhouse facilitating electronic payments and financial services for banks, merchants and businesses. It underpins the backbone of the digital economy and plays a pivotal role in the ongoing shift to cashless transactions. Additionally, the company keeps up with emerging financial trends in innovative areas like cross-border payments and digital banking solutions. FI delivered record revenue, EPS and FCF in 2023, and growth is set to carry over into 2024. In Q1 FY24, Fiserv’s revenue increased 7% YOY to $4.88 billion. EPS swelled 39% YOY to $1.24 per share, with operating margin up 370 basis points to 24.2%. Management reiterated revenue growth between 15% and 17% in FY24 and raised their adjusted EPS outlook to between $8.60 and $8.75 per share. That makes Fiserv one of the top stocks to make you a millionaire by 2035.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "MENLO PARK, Calif., April 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Meta (PRNewsfoto/Meta)\n\n\"It's been a good start to the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, % Change In millions, except percentages and per share amounts 2024 2023 Revenue $               36,455 $               28,645 27 % Costs and expenses 22,637 21,418 6 % Income from operations $               13,818 $                 7,227 91 % Operating margin 38 % 25 % Provision for income taxes $                 1,814 $                 1,598 14 % Effective tax rate 13 % 22 % Net income $               12,369 $                 5,709 117 % Diluted earnings per share (EPS) $                   4.71 $                   2.20 114 %\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n\nFamily daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.24 billion on average for March 2024, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 20% year-over-year. Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 6% year-over-year. Revenue – Total revenue and revenue on a constant currency basis were $36.46 billion and $36.35 billion, respectively, both of which increased by 27% year-over-year. Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $22.64 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.72 billion. Capital return program – Share repurchases were $14.64 billion of our Class A common stock and dividends payments were $1.27 billion. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.12 billion as of March 31, 2024. Free cash flow was $12.53 billion. Headcount – Headcount was 69,329 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 10% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\n\nWe expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\nQ1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.

Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\n\nContacts\n\nInvestors: Kenneth Dorell\r\ninvestor@meta.com / investor.fb.com\n\nPress: Ryan Moore\r\npress@meta.com / about.fb.com/news/\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 24, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

        "title": "Meta’s $360 Billion Rally to Collide With Lofty AI Expectations",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to social-media stocks, there’s Meta Platforms Inc., and then there’s everyone else.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Biden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Tesla Soars as Musk’s Cheaper EVs Calm Fears Over Strategy\n\nThe Facebook parent has been the best-performer in the sector this year by far amid a surge in profitability. Delivering better revenue growth, it’s also cheaper than smaller peers like Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc.\n\nBut to keep a rally that’s added more than $360 billion in market value going, Meta must show it can maintain such growth when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Of particular interest to investors: seeing a return on investment from hefty spending on artificial intelligence.\n\n“The case is still there with some of the initiatives around AI and everything they’re doing to continue to improve targeting and engagement,” Hanna Howard, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said. “There’s still room for growth on the top line and to continue to improve in margins. And, where it’s trading right now, at these levels it does still look attractive.”\n\nShares rose 1.7% on Wednesday.\n\nIn February, Meta reported massive growth in both earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter, which also illustrated the impact of cost-cutting measures that included thousands of job cuts. It also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend. In contrast, both Snap and Pinterest delivered disappointing growth.\n\nThat has set up high expectations that may be difficult to overcome. This time around, Meta’s profit is expected to nearly double in the first quarter, while revenue is seen growing by 26%. Still, both are expected to wane later in the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors will be looking for updates on AI, which Meta has been using to improve ad targeting. The company recently debuted a new version of its AI model, which will run its in-app AI assistant.\n\n“Meta has really evolved from a social play to more of an AI one, and it has a lot of tailwinds from that,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. “Plus, while there were some growing pains with its year of efficiency, it is a lot more efficient now.”\n\nWith the stock clearly outperforming Snap, Pinterest and Reddit this year, Meta continues to look like the bargain of the group. The stock trades at 23 times estimated earnings, a discount to both its 10-year average and the overall Nasdaq 100 Index, as well as being cheaper than social peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Zuckerberg Avoids Personal Liability in Meta Addiction Suits\n\nWhile Meta faces scrutiny around parameters for teens and children on its social media sites, it could benefit from some pending social media limitations. The US government is aiming to shut down TikTok, one of Meta’s biggest rivals, with a divest-or-ban bill that is headed to the Senate. Meanwhile, the number of daily users on X is reportedly falling, while Fidelity has cut the value of its position in the company formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“Meta’s market-share trends look good, AI trends look good, while peers continue to be very hit or miss. And when they do miss, the market has been unforgiving,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “We have a lot less conviction in the smaller social players, which seem to be struggling.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTesla Inc. shares rebounded after Elon Musk vowed to launch less-expensive vehicles as soon as late this year, easing concerns about disappointing earnings results and diminished growth prospects. The stock gained 13%, putting it on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since January 2022.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nWhen Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink took over ASML Holding NV a little more than a decade ago, it was a relative minnow based in the sleepy Dutch town of Veldhoven. On Wednesday, he retires from the helm of Europe’s most valuable technology company. SK Hynix Inc. plans to spend about $14.6 billion building a new memory chip complex in South Korea, preparing to meet rapidly growing demand for semiconductors employed in AI development. For TikTok, the clock has started running in its existential fight to avoid a US ban. Mobvoi Inc., a Chinese artificial intelligence developer backed by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, finished its first day of trading lower in Hong Kong, marking the third stock debut to flop in the city this week. Shares of Tencent Holdings Ltd. have surged more than 10% this month, outperforming the Magnificent Seven and underscoring global investors’ growing appetite for China’s undervalued megacaps.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nAmphenol TE Connectivity Teledyne Silicon Labs Perfect Postmarket\n\nMeta Platforms IBM ServiceNow Lam Research Tyler Tech Teradyne Pegasystems Impinj Plexus MaxLinear\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender Big Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets China’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of growth stocks and how they relate to the current stock market environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.\n\nAs the first quarter of 2024 is behind us, the stock market is also presenting a changed environment. The first quarter saw an extension of the themes that were in play during Q4 2023. It saw artificial intelligence and technology stocks continue to post gains, as investors were not only convinced that AI held great potential when it came to consumer and business use cases, but also that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates multiple times this year.\n\nHowever, with Q2 now officially underway, investor expectations for a robust economic environment to pile vast sums of money into the stock market have now shifted. Part of this is due to fresh economic data that shows that despite the fact that it is significantly down from the highs of 2022, inflation is still higher than what the Federal Reserve would like to observe. Consequently, major stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite have dialed down some of their gains as Wall Street starts to enter a 'wait and watch' phase.\n\nFor instance, while the S&P 500 made news in 2024 for crossing the 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history, it ended up losing more than 4% of these gains during the second and third week of April 2024 after the inflation data for March 2024 was released. Similarly, the tech heavy NASDAQ Comp fell by 7% during the same time period and recovered some of these gains later on.\n\nHow does this relate to growth stocks? Well, the macroeconomic factors that have contributed to the illustrious stock indexes shedding their gains are also ones that do not bode well for growth stocks. One of the most commonly accepted definitions of a growth stock is a firm whose price bakes in a significant premium over the earnings per share. This premium is measured through the price to earnings ratio, which is also evaluated along with the industry average to see whether the high multiple is an industry trend or an exception.\n\nGrowth stocks are also some of the most highly sought ones on Wall Street since investing for most people is all about making money by watching share prices grow. Some of the best known growth stocks of our times have transformed industries and made history in their respective industries. Two such examples are the semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). AMD's shares are up by a whopping 445% over the past five years, showing that those investors with the correct insights about the semiconductor industry who had the foresight to buy the shares in 2019 would be significantly better off now. So why have AMD's shares soared? The answer to this question lies in the nature of the semiconductor industry and the prowess of the firm's CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The nature of the chip sector means that not every company can sell x86 microprocessors. In fact, most such processors are made by the chip behemoth Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and AMD's success has been due to its ability to capture market share from the larger rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has soared because it became the first company in the world to make and ship electric vehicles on scale. Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund:\n\nTesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth.\n\nSo, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more: 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\nA close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top growth stocks, we ranked the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top growth stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best growth stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\n12. Adobe Inc.

        "content": "Elon Musk's Big Bet: Tesla to Ramp Up AI Development with Nvidia's Powerful Chips\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may install 85,000 Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 chips by year-end to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nIf CEO Elon Musk proceeds with this plan, Tesla will surpass tech giants like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a significant Nvidia customer.\n\nDuring Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report for 2024, Musk disclosed that the company currently possesses 35,000 H100 chips, the most advanced and expensive graphics processing units designed for AI applications, CNBC reports.\n\nThese chips are vital for Musk’s AI initiatives, which include the development of advanced robots like Optimus Bot and Robotaxi and a supercomputer named Dojo.\n\nReports indicate that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is Nvidia’s largest customer.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Nvidia produced 550,000 chips last year, and companies must wait until 2024 to secure additional supplies.\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest buyer, as stated by Omdia, with an order of 150,000 GPUs in 2023. Other significant purchasers include Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Google, and Amazon, each reportedly acquiring 50,000 chips. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon nearly account for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. CNBC writes.\n\nMusk had mocked Nvidia’s substantial market capitalization loss on April 19, calling the 10% stock decline “rookie numbers” on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNvidia experienced a significant drop in stock value, shedding $211 billion in market capitalization, marking the second-largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThis steep decline was triggered by disappointing earnings from ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and a pessimistic market outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nMeanwhile, analysts maintained their bullish stance on Nvidia, expecting it to rule the accelerator market primarily backed by its Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 205% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is scheduled to post earnings results for its first quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts expect the Menlo Park, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $4.32 per share, up from $2.20 per share in the year-ago period. Meta is projected to report quarterly revenue of $36.16 billion, up from $28.64 billion in the same quarter last year, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Meta has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in six straight quarters.\n\nOn April 22, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson maintained Meta Platforms with an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $575 to $555, while JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone reiterated the stock with a Market Outperform and maintained a $550 price target.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Meta Platforms, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta Platforms has a dividend yield of 0.40%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta Platforms, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00  = 3,000 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,488,300 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $297,660 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on META\n\nAlso Read: Investor Sentiment Improves Further, Dow Jumps Over 250 Points\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA Price Action: Shares of Meta Platforms rose 3% to close at $496.10 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: Tesla, Boeing And 3 Stocks To Watch Heading Into Wednesday\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Amidst the artificial intelligence revolution and increasing chip demand, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has shown remarkable resilience and strategic growth. Despite a recent 20% pullback from its highs, indicating market consolidation, the stock remains robust, trading above critical averages and maintaining positive momentum.\n\nThis resilience is bolstered by AMD's strategic focus on expanding its footprint in the data center and AI chip markets, challenging industry leaders like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nWith key tech partnerships and an ambitious sales growth target for server GPUs, AMD is well-positioned to capitalize on the surging demand for AI and data center capabilities, signaling a promising outlook in the semiconductor space. AI Is Powering AMD's Future\n\nAMD Data by GuruFocus\n\nAMD eyes data center growth and AI chip market, securing key tech partnerships\n\nAmid the headwinds in China, AMD has given a bullish update on its AI chips and appears to be well-positioned to challenge Nvidia's dominance. Likewise, the company has set its sights on significant growth in the data center segment, where demand for powerful chips capable of handling massive data requirements for AI is rising.\n\nThe chip giant expects to generate $3.50 billion in server GPU sales in 2024, up from an initial target of $2 billion. The expected growth comes from the company's strategic partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which have already shown strong interest in its chips. The leading semiconductor company known for its CPUs and GPUs delivered a 10% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, reaching a high of $6.20 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the increase was largely fueled by record sales in the data center segment amid solid demand for the company's Instinct GPUs and EPYC CPUs. Data center revenue for the quarter was up 38% to $2.30 billion, underscoring the company's competitive edge in this critical and growing market.\n\nAMD's stellar performance affirms its strategic positioning and long-term prospects because the semiconductor industry is focused on data centers and AI applications. According to the CEO Lisa Su, the strong demand positions the company for significant growth as artificial intelligence reshapes the computing market.\n\nMoreover, robust revenue growth remains the catalyst behind the company's improved financial performance. Its net income in the fourth quarter increased by about 3,000% to $667 million from just $21 million in the same quarter last year. Net income growth was bolstered by the 38% growth in data center revenue as the company also managed its operational expenses, effectively coming in at $6.60 billion compared to $6 billion in the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, profitability has improved significantly amid the AI frenzy that has triggered strong demand for the company's chips. Hence, AMD has bounced to profitability of 18 cents and 41 cents per share over the past two quarters, while gross margins improved to 47% from 43%, driven by robust revenue growth. AI Is Powering AMD's Future\n\nStrategic play to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI GPU market\n\nAI is evolving at a breakneck pace, becoming an area that has turned into a battlefield for semiconductor magnates. And that's happening right in the niche of AI GPUs, meaning graphics processing units designed for the ever-more sophisticated and specialized purposes of AI.\n\nThe MI300X AI GPU is a major leap for AMD in its effort to seize market share that is currently held by Nvidia, especially in competition with the latter's H100 chip. The company's strategy is competitive pricing, technological innovation and a more intensified software ecosystem to be a very strong player. AI Is Powering AMD's Future\n\nSource: AMD\n\nBreaking the price barrier\n\nA key aspect of AMD's approach is its pricing strategy for the MI300X AI GPU. Widely anticipated to come in at under $40,000, it would present a more budget-friendly option than Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\nIt is, therefore, expected that this strategic pricing will really lower the barriers for companies and research institutions keen on delving into AI model development, where advanced AI computing can be accessible by a larger audience.\n\nBy undercutting Nvidia on price, AMD targets users that are looking for high-performance computing solutions, but not at a premium price point.\n\nThe new frontier in AI computing: Revolutionary architecture and enhanced software ecosystem\n\nThe very heart of the MI300X is potentially game-changing architecture, driving AMD's challenge to Nvidia with big upgrades over the H100.\n\nThe 192GB of HBM3 memory packed inside the MI300X suggests AMD is pushing into high-performance memory technology with faster data transfers; this is also key to supporting more powerful, bigger and increasingly sophisticated AI models.\n\nThat would underline MI300 as the fastest in reaching $1 billion in sales for a chipset and signal the lightning-fast market expectation on the product's adoption and readiness for a competitive alternative to Nvidia's offerings. This was reflected in the development very positively; it was an affirmation of the technological leadership of the product and the thrust in strategic marketing by AMD.\n\nNow that the AI GPU supremacy battle is fought on more than hardware grounds, AMD has made a substantial update to its ROCm software suite. The move speaks directly to one of the largest barriers to changing GPU suppliers: the software ecosystem.\n\nNvidia's CUDA has been the dominant standard in GPU-accelerated computing, effectively checking the inflow for any competitor. By enhancing the capabilities of the ROCm ecosystem, AMD is really taking on not only the hardware domain of Nvidia, but also software dominance, making the migration or development of AI-based projects on AMD GPUs much more developer-friendly.\n\nFinally, according to tech expert Markus Schaal, AMD is challenging Nvidia's stronghold in the AI GPU market with its MI300X, which outperforms Nvidia's A100 GPU by more than 100% in FP32 workloads, offering a compelling advantage for AI and HPC applications. The company has significantly improved its ROCm software stack for AI, achieving near-parity with industry needs, enhancing compatibility with major AI frameworks and securing notable endorsements from tech leaders.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe all-encompassing approach by AMD to face off with Nvidia in the AI GPU market underlines a large degree of ambitious planning and what may change in the industry with regard to landscaping.\n\nBy providing a competitively priced product of top-notch quality and including the critical aspect of software support, AMD places itself as a vendor to be reckoned with in front of the established dominance of Nvidia. To challenge the company's deep-rooted dominance, AMD must combine aggressive marketing and continuous innovation with unwavering support from the developer community.\n\nThe AI GPU market is dynamic, with technological advancements and developer preferences constantly evolving. Success for AMD lies wholly in the current momentum it is maintaining in innovation, market penetration and ecosystem development to take on Nvidia, not as a technical powerhouse, but as a solutions provider for every aspect of AI.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmidst the AI boom and growing chip demand, AMD showcases resilience and strategic growth, even after a 20% pullback. Focused on expanding its presence in the data center and AI markets, AMD challenges leaders like Nvidia with key partnerships and ambitious sales targets.\n\nIts strong market position, supported by robust stock fundamentals and technological innovations, signals AMD's readiness to capitalize on AI and data center demands. This approach outlines AMD's strategic vision to navigate market shifts and stake a claim in the competitive semiconductor landscape, highlighting a promising path forward in the AI-driven era.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Q1 earnings preview: Ad growth and AI are front and center",
        "content": "Meta (META) will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with Wall Street looking for another sizable jump in revenue for the social media giant. Shares of Meta have been on a tear, climbing 116% over the last 12 months and more than45% year to date. That’s far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 45%in the last 12 months and 16%year to date.\n\nWhile part of Meta’s stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company’s stock price truly rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting Meta to report earnings per share of $4.30 on revenue of $36.1 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark another huge jump in EPS and revenue from the same quarter last year when the company reported earnings of $2.20 on revenue of $28.6 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech during the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut JPMorgan Securities analyst Doug Anmuth says Meta’s growth spike could face trouble in the coming months.\n\n“There is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough [comparisons] & perception of lack of new drivers vs. [2023],” Anmuth wrote in a recent earnings note.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt was equally cautious in his own analyst note, saying that he will be primarily focused on “the pace of expected growth in 2Q and 2H24 against more challenging comps.”\n\nDespite that potential headwind, Meta has a number of strengths going its way, including its continued effort in combating TikTok with its Reels platform. The company has also emerged as a potential early winner in the AI space, with the technology set to improve Meta’s overall advertising capabilities.\n\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18. The chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\n\nThe bot, which is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messages, and the Meta.AI website, also can’t be turned off even if users don’t want to use it.\n\nDespite Meta’s increased emphasis on AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t giving up on his quest to bring his vision for the metaverse to life. On Monday, he took a further step toward increasing the number of AR/VR headsets on the market, announcing that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies to use it to build their own devices.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

The company's revenue growth, fueled by premium rate increases and rising memberships, contributes to its positive trajectory. Strategic acquisitions and partnerships have fortified its business portfolio.\r\n\r\nNotably, a robust Medicare Advantage segment, combined with successful contract acquisitions, is poised to drive future memberships. It increased the 2024 earnings guidance to $37.20 per share, compared with previous year's $33.14 figure. The Carelon business is a key contributor to its success. It utilizes excess capital to boost shareholder value.\r\n\r\nHowever, its rising expenses continue to put pressure on margins. Its high balance sheet debt is reducing financial flexibility. Also, its declining free cash flow is a concern. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elevance Health here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Canadian Natural Resources have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - Canadian industry over the past year (+31.5% vs. +17.2%). The company's balanced and diverse production mix facilitates long-term value and reduces the risk profile. Canadian Natural's acquisition of Athabasca Oil Sands project in 2017 has added significant value to its asset base and buoyed the production prospects.\r\n\r\nNotably, lower capital needs and improving operational efficiencies have enabled the company to generate significant free cash flow. What's more, the company remains committed to investor friendly moves by the way of dividend payout and stock buybacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Canadian Natural is set to face debt maturities each year out till 2027. Further, the C$3.25-billion term loan to fund the Devon Energy asset buy has worsened the company's debt-to-capital ratio and led to higher interest outgo. The interplay of these factors accounts for the cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Canadian Natura Resources here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Coca-Cola Co. and The Progressive Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, PDD Holdings and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, PDD Holdings Inc. PDD and Apple Inc's AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nMagnificent Meta a Compelling Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAfter a dismal 2022, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms, Inc. made a terrific comeback last year. Meta Platforms delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and joined the trillion-dollar market capitalization at the onset of 2024.\n\nA rebound in Meta Platforms' flagship ad business and its cost-cutting initiatives further bolstered expectations for bullish first-quarter 2024 earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 24, after market close.\n\nMeta Platforms is estimated to report earnings per share of $4.32 for the first three months of 2024, more than $2.64 a year ago, representing a jump of 63.6%. Moreover, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement.\n\nMeta Platforms' shares, rightfully, soared around 37% in the first quarter. However, its shares are trading in the negative territory in April, more or less matching the broader market. Skeptics doubt Meta Platforms' big spending goal on generative AI and the Metaverse as it may impact the company's financials.\n\nYet, Meta Platforms' current hiccup is momentary. Instead, the company remains a market darling. This is because Meta Platforms' digital advertising business is gaining strength from e-commerce firms in China.\n\nDiscount shopping app, Temu has given stiff competition to Amazon.com, Inc. in China as it racked up solid sales in the past year. Now, PDD Holdings Inc., Temu's parent company has extensively used Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook platforms with ads for Temu, something that bodes well for the social media behemoth.\n\nInterestingly, Meta Platforms is currently teaming up with Amazon. Links will be provided on the Instagram and Facebook platforms for users to purchase goods from Amazon. This initiative will boost Meta Platforms' ad revenues as well as improve transaction growth for Amazon. What's more, competing rivals could further strike similar deals with Meta Platforms, a tailwind for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives' inclination toward banning TikTok from operating in the United States should stand in good stead for Meta Platforms. TikTok is suspected of becoming a security threat as it influences public opinion in the United States. Nonetheless, banning TikTok will compel its audience to shift toward Instagram reels, and advertisements will follow.\n\nStory continues\n\nStatista, meanwhile, reported that the AI market is expected to see a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 and 2030. Meta Platforms, thus, has joined the AI frenzy, which should help its shares gain traction. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg recently launched the Meta.ai chatbot. Meta Platforms has also launched an updated AI chip to enhance its data centers.\n\nMeta Platforms' bet on Metaverse somehow didn't look good for the company. Its Reality Labs division has been incurring losses for quite some time. But lately, with the launch of Quest 3, Meta Platforms' VR headset, sales from the Reality Labs division are poised to improve. Lest we forget, Mark Zuckerberg has already downplayed the threat from Apple Inc's Vision Pro headset.\n\nThe current year is also the 'Year of Efficiency' for Meta Platforms. The company has slashed umpteen jobs to streamline its operation. Such cost-cutting measures will help the company mitigate macroeconomic headwinds, apprehensions of a recession and higher interest rates. The company, anyhow, is cash-rich making it unperturbed to market upheavals. Meta Platforms' cash and cash equivalents were $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, up from $61.12 billion on Sep 30, 2023.\n\nTo top it, the net profit margin of Meta Platforms is nearly 29%, way higher than the 20% mark, indicating a high margin. In other words, the company has kept its operating expenses under check and is worthy of generating the necessary profit from sales. In reality, Meta Platforms have been efficiently generating profits since it has a return on equity of 29.5%, which is typically considered good.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms enjoy an economic moat. Almost half of social media platform handlers globally are using Meta Platforms' applications. This diversification and huge audience base protect the company from any downside risk.\n\nThe social media giant also began paying dividends recently, and a passive income surely shouldn't bother any razor-sharp investor. Meta Platforms' annual dividend yield is 0.42%, which is less, but the company is just starting. Thus, Meta Platforms' shares have more upside left in the near future and is currently a compelling buy.\n\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 35.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next years is 18.2% and 12.8%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta Platforms' current-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. Meta Platforms currently possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg got $24.4 million in ‘other compensation’ in 2023—but Meta also treated staff well, with the median employee making $379,000",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg is Meta’s lowest-paid employee—at least on paper. The tech entrepreneur’s base salary for 2023 was a humble $1 dollar, while the median worker at the tech giant took home a staggering $379,000.\n\nIn comparison, the average tech worker can expect to earn between $35,000 to $120,000 depending on the role, according to Indeed.\n\nBut don’t be fooled by Zuckerberg’s humble base pay and the fact that he didn’t take home a bonus last year—the billionaire still cost the company millions in compensation.\n\nAccording to a proxy filing statement published ahead of the annual meeting of shareholders at the end of May, the Facebook founder received $24.4 million in ‘other compensation’—much of which covered his security costs.\n\nZuckerberg’s security costs hit by ‘year of efficiency’\n\nIn 2023, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, revealed that it had increased Zuckerberg’s personal security pre-tax allowance by 40% from $10 million in 2018 to around $14 million.\n\nThe announcement came just after the company laid off 11,000 employees, the equivalent of 13% of its workforce, leading various publications to link the two.\n\nHowever, since then the company has slashed thousands of more jobs, while Zuckerberg’s spending on security has actually slightly decreased.\n\nIn 2022, the social networking chief splashed out $14,829,245 on personal security “at his residences and during personal travel,” according to the proxy filing. Meanwhile, last year—during Meta’s “year of efficiency”—his security bill came to a total of $9,431,139.\n\nThe compensation payment also includes almost $1 million “for costs related to personal usage of private aircraft.”\n\nWhile justifying the cost, Meta explained that it has identified “specific threats” to Zuckerberg as the face of the brand, including being targeted by angry customers.\n\n“We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg's role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the company wrote in the filing.\n\n“Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention.”\n\nFortune has contacted Meta for comment.\n\nThe $1 salary club\n\nZuckerberg’s been part of the $1 salary club—which has previously included Larry Page, Larry Ellison and the late Steve Jobs— since 2013, making his salary earnings just $11 in over a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut he’s seen his personal wealth balloon. In February, his net worth soared by $28 billion in just one day thanks to Meta’s better-than-expected fourth quarterly results.\n\nAfter a year of being in cost-cutting mode, including dismissing about 21,000 workers, the company doubled its operating margin to 41% and decreased expenses by 8% year over year.\n\nAs a result of Meta’s turnaround success, Zuckerberg—whose wealth is largely tied to his stake in the social media giant—has leap–frogged Elon Musk as the world's third-richest person, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nAs of April 23, Zuckerberg’s net worth is $176 billion—up from around $78 billion this time last year.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Scoop Up at a Discount While the AI Rally Takes a Breather",
        "content": "Interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) has surged, aligning with broader interest around companies operating in this space. Internet searches, news coverage and discussions on earnings calls all showcase the sort of hype and hysteria following companies in this space. Companies that many may not have considered AI plays have increasingly pushed their businesses toward such models, expanding the number of options for investors.\n\nFollowing are three stocks I think can benefit from continued earnings outperformance, driven in part by the rise of AI. These companies each have unique catalysts worth considering. Further, they could surpass the average market growth rate over the coming decade.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into those three top AI stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking to buy AI stocks that are among the top performing stocks for years, Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a no-brainer choice. The company has continuously impressed market analysts, and has done so again this past quarter. Alphabet is up an impressive 13% year-to-date (YTD), with much further to climb.\n\nThe company sports a robust and diversified portfolio that can withstand economic fluctuations. Its cloud computing segment experienced a surge during the pandemic. And, innovative AI products like Gemini promise long-term growth.\n\nFurther, Alphabet is challenging its competitors with Gemini AI, outperforming benchmark tests like the multitask language understanding test. Its Google Cloud segment continually gains traction with its new tensor processing unit (TPU), offering superior efficiency. With a solid primary business and advancing AI segment, Alphabet’s stock shows promise at a reasonable valuation.\n\nConsider investing in Alphabet stock before April 25, ahead of its first-quarter conference call, which could spark a significant uptrend. Despite concerns over AI and valuation inflation as a result, Alphabet’s strong core digital advertising base should provide the stock with some stability. With revenue climbing at a rapid rate, I think this top search company is a sneaky AI play worth considering right now.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother tech and AI giant in the sector that investors should be paying attention to is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Through the company’s smart strategies and cost-efficient solutions in AI, META once again surpassed analyst forecasts this past quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a robust operating margin and $43 billion in free cash flow, Meta Platforms emerges as another winner in the digital advertising realm. It is firmly anchored by its suite of social media platforms. Regardless of economic fluctuations, the sector promises significant growth potential.\n\nConcurrently, Meta Platforms launched new AI products, reinforcing its commitment to generative AI. This included Llama 3 and real-time image generators integrated into Meta AI across its platforms. META’s stock rose following the announcement. The enhanced Meta AI, driven by the latest version of its large language model Llama 3, will be integrated more prominently across Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Reels, with a dedicated website at Meta.ai.\n\nMETA aims for substantial returns from its AI investments, leveraging them to boost app engagement and advertising sales. These will put Meta Platforms in a greater position, especially in innovations like Click-to-Message ads. Investors should hoard some META stock before April 24, where the company has scheduled its Q1 2024 earnings report.\n\nShopify (SHOP)  Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nRunning after Amazon in the global e-commerce sector, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) succeeds in internet infrastructure for small and big businesses. The platform has provided business owners with excellent tools for starting, developing and managing retail operations, making the company quite popular and profitable through the years.\n\nLeading dog brand named BARK Inc. recently expanded their partnership with Shopify to enhance their experience and boost efficiency in their business operations. Leveraging Shopify’s tools, BARK aims to optimize acquisition costs, explore new channels and improve key metrics. The move includes migrating all business units to BARK.co by fiscal 2025 for unified operations and better insights.\n\nIn other similar news, Cognizantcollaborated with Shopify and Google Cloud to revamp digital platforms for global retailers and brands. By integrating Shopify’s commerce platform with Google Cloud’s infrastructure, Cognizant aims to enhance customer experiences and implement real-time recommendations and personalized offers. This alliance addressed challenges like scaling operations and modernizing commerce platforms, leveraging generative AI and Google Cloud’s suite of tools.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting markets right now due to the seemingly unlimited potential of its applications in businesses everywhere. Many large companies are making massive investments to integrate AI into their platforms and services to stay ahead of the charge and offer customers the latest and greatest edition tech has to offer.\n\nThe three stocks we will examine today are currently on a dip and trading at a lower price than their actual value. When stocks dip due to volatility or other short-term events, investors have an excellent opportunity to buy when the stock is cheaper and see significant profits when it bounces back to its former price.\n\nWe’ll detail why these three AI stocks are so prominent in today’s AI market and why the dips they are facing now give investors a chance to profit from their inevitable future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is unique to the other stocks on this list as the company is dedicated entirely to AI software for businesses. It offers AI software-as-a-service to assist other companies looking to integrate AI platforms into their operations.\n\nThe potential applications of C3.ai’s software are near the point where it is limited only by the imagination and vision of the company utilizing it. Because of the extensive range of uses possible within C3.ai’s AI development platform, the company has no peers that offer a similar service that makes up direct competition.\n\nDespite its state-of-the-art AI software and lack of competition, C3.ai has been on the dip since late February. The stock has fallen over 40% this year and sits at just over $21, almost half its peak earlier this year.\n\nC3.ai has taken a hit this year due to inflation affecting businesses’ spending power. However, despite these headwinds, the company is not showing a weak performance. The company’s most recent earnings report showed a year-over-year revenue increase of 18% and a 58% profit margin.\n\nWhile the company could improve its earnings and is priced low, there is no reason not to believe that C3.ai will be one of the first companies to benefit from businesses’ increasing demand for AI platforms.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most prominent cybersecurity companies to date and is also leading the charge in incorporating AI into its platform. Its generative AI analyst, Charlotte AI, offers advanced features as part of the company’s leading Falcon platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has seen a stellar performance since the summer of 2023 when the stock shot up 300% to reach its all-time high in February of this year. In fiscal 2024, the company generated over $3 billion in revenue and generated free cash flow of $938.2 million.\n\nSubscription revenue accounts for almost all of the company’s income and has some of the highest retention and adoption rates in the cybersecurity sector. While the company’s outlook expects another $1 billion increase in revenue over the next year, to much surprise, the stock has fallen over $40 in the past month.\n\nConsidering Crowdstrike has been one of the most expensive cybersecurity stocks, a dip like this presents an exceedingly rare opportunity for interested investors. While the stock may dip further with such a high valuation, there is a likelihood Crowdstrike will see another leap in the years to come. That makes the current dip a one-of-a-kind chance.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. It is a stock that has been on many investors’ lists over the past few years. The AI chip manufacturer is second only to tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but is in a fantastic position to capitalize on the growing demand for AI chips.\n\nThis past month, investors had a golden opportunity to buy AMD on the dip. The stock fell almost 20% due to volatility and macroeconomic headwinds. While AMD does not have as much market share as Nvidia, its products are up to par — some might say even better.\n\nAI chips allow users to extract the processing power necessary to run through the enormous amounts of data required for AI applications. While Nvidia’s H100 chips are exceedingly popular, AMD’s MI300 chips are even more powerful. AMD also offers open-source software that pairs with the chips, which claims to provide better accessibility to users than Nvidia’s software. AMD has profitable deals with monster companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for its chips, ensuring a steady income stream. With the coming boom in AI, AMD will certainly be at the forefront. Its current low price is something any investor should keep an eye on this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morning Bid: Tesla catches break, Meta next; TikTok countdown",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nAiling Tesla shares caught a rare 10% break overnight despite the electric auto giant's quarterly revenue miss, underscoring a better market mood as Meta steps up to the earnings dock later and U.S. business activity cools in April.\n\nDeep in a global price war and hit by waning worldwide demand for electric vehicles, Tesla said its quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2020 and by more than Wall St analysts had forecast. Revenue per vehicle plunged 5% from year ago.\n\nBut perhaps reflecting the extent of short-selling that fed this year's 42%-plus stock drop up to Tuesday's close, shares surged once the report was released after the bell - ostensibly cheered by somewhat vague plans to introduce low-cost \"new models\" by early 2025 and boss Elon Musk's update.\n\nMore buoyant tech stocks generally helped as the megacaps shape up to report their quarterlies through this week and next. The S&P500 at large clocked a second straight day of gains on Tuesday, which saw the index recover more than a third of the near-6% peak-to-trough slide this month.\n\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms, one the big winners from the artificial intelligence boom of the past 18 months and whose stock is still up more than 40% this year, reports after the market close on Wednesday.\n\nIn the background, the U.S. Senate voted by a wide margin late Tuesday in favor of legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year. The move ups the ante in the increasingly tense U.S.-China tech standoff.\n\nThe four-year battle over TikTok, which is used by 170 million people in the United States, is just one front in a war over the internet and technology between Washington and Beijing. Last week, Apple said Beijing had ordered it to remove Meta Platforms' WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China due to Chinese national security concerns.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Shanghai on Wednesday with U.S.-China ties fragile and with a daunting array of unresolved issues between the two global rivals.\n\nAs Blinken hits Beijing, President Joe Biden will sign a bill into law that provides billions of dollars of new aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, a bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks re-election.\n\nAlso lifting investor spirits yesterday was this month's flash U.S. business readings from S&P Global that showed a surprising slowdown in overall activity in April and ebbing price pressures and labor costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven though the miss may seem worrying, markets read the report as a potential relief to the increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve - helping Fed rate futures and Treasuries rally.\n\nHelping the $69 billion two-year note auction in the process, the report dragged two-year Treasury yields back from 5% - although they continue to hover about 4.94% early on Wednesday as another $70 billion of 5-year notes is up for grabs later in the day.\n\nThe markets didn't run away with the S&P Global business survey for two reasons - they want to see any April slowdown confirmed by equivalent ISM surveys due next week and they were sideswiped by rebounding March new home sales data released shortly after.\n\nAnd that kept the dollar buoyed, not least against Japan's yen - where it inched ever closer to 155 yen at 34-year highs just as the Bank of Japan meets this week.\n\nThe weak yen and rallying tech sector saw Japan's Nikkei outperform generally buoyant world stocks on Wednesday, with gains of more than 2%.\n\nThe U.S. business readings stand in contrast to the better-than-forecast purchasing managers' surveys from the euro zone and Britain.\n\nReinforcing those numbers on Wednesday, German business morale captured by the Ifo survey improved more than expected in April.\n\nEuropean bourses and Wall St futures were higher as earnings streamed in on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nShares in French luxury group Kering were a standout mover, falling by almost 10% in early trade to their lowest level in over 6 years as the market digested news of a likely 40%-45% plunge in first-half operating profit.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n\n* US March durable goods orders\n\n* US corporate earnings: Meta Platforms, IBM, Ford, Boeing, Lam Research, General Dynamics, CME, AT&T, Hasbro, Norfolk Southern, Universal Health, Molina Healthcare, Amphenol, Chipotle, Masco, Bunge, Otis, Hilton, Fortive, Westinghouse, Interpublic, Teradyne, United Rentals, Tyler Technologies, Align Technology, Avery Dennison, TE Connectivity, Rollins, O'Reilly Automotive etc\n\n* European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel speaks; Bank of Canada releases minutes of latest policy meeting\n\n* US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits China. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Berlin\n\n* US Treasury sells $70 billion of 5-year notes\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Christina Fincher, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft earnings will be all about AI and whether one of them deserves to be  on the ‘wall of worry’",
        "content": "Since the blockbuster debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022, the topic of AI has dominated the earnings calls of many tech companies. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have mentioned the acronym nearly 200 times in each earnings cycle since, including during the first earnings week this year in January and February.\n\nAnalysts expect AI to be the central theme yet again during earnings calls for the first three months of this year, with Meta reporting on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet on Thursday. But the talk from executives has shifted from “what AI can do?” to “what AI is doing?,” and all three of this week’s Big Tech companies will have a different answer.\n\nFor Microsoft, cloud computing platform Azure is the star of its AI portfolio, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citi. Launched more than a decade ago, Azure now offers a suite of AI tools to businesses including a service that builds custom generative AI apps from existing models. Azure is “one of the best-positioned AI players” in the market and the “main lever” for Microsoft to make money on generative AI right now, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note to investors. That confidence partly comes from Microsoft not having to drastically change how it makes money to drive additional revenue from AI, they wrote.\n\nIn contrast, most of Google’s revenue comes from search and related services, which AI from other companies could eventually replace. Google could cannibalize its search business by building a rival AI one, but that would leave it in a precarious position.\n\nAzure’s business grew 30% year-over-year for the quarter ending December 31, with six points of that growth coming directly from the demand by its customers for AI-related products, CFO Amy Hood said during the company’s earnings call. Expect an additional one to two percentage points of growth from AI services for the first three months of 2024, Citi analysts said in an April 18 report. Microsoft also has other budding AI businesses that the analysts say will contribute meaningfully to revenue next year—namely, the company’s virtual assistant, Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are generally less confident in Google’s business than in Microsoft’s, with Goldman analysts calling its parent’s stock a “wall of worry.” In addition to questioning the growth of  Google’s search business in an AI future, investors worry about the company’s operating margins and the impact of potential regulation. Investors will also have “a heightened degree of concern” about how much Google is spending on AI over the coming earnings seasons, Goldman’s analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Google is a leader in the AI cloud world, which includes many of the services it offers to other businesses, Goldman analysts said in an April 15 report. At Google’s Cloud Next event earlier this month, the company announced expanded access to large language model Gemini and an AI-powered coding assistant.\n\nWhile Meta offers an AI assistant and large language model similar to Microsoft’s and Google’s—including its new Llama 3 model introduced last week, which is free for research and commercial use—that’s not what analysts have their eyes on. In notes from Goldman, Citi, and Bank of America, analysts put much more emphasis on how Meta is using AI to improve its social media algorithms.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, makes most of its money from advertising. The more time users spend scrolling through their feeds, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta generates. In recent months, the company has been working on rebuilding its model for recommending videos to Facebook users, with the help of AI. If effective, the tweak could keep users on Meta’s platforms for longer. When tested on Facebook Reels last year, the new AI-powered technology contributed to “an 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,” Facebook head Tom Alison said at a tech conference last month.\n\nIt is still early for these tools, Bank of America analysts said in an April 19 note, but that means investors could enjoy some “positive product surprises” and revenue growth this year. And with a potential U.S. ban on TikTok, a major competitor, Meta's business is looking well positioned at the moment, they said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Selling",
        "content": "Within the last month, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh highs. While there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors and industries, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been widely credited with lifting these major stock indexes to record levels.\n\nPut simply, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded businesses in the country. These seven juggernauts are (listed in descending order by market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll seven of these companies have crushed the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade. This outperformance is a big reason why investors -- and members of Congress -- have flocked to these businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (and members of Congress) have historically flocked to the Magnificent Seven\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven are leaders or critical players in their respective industries:\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the undisputed leader in global desktop operating systems, while Azure is No. 2 in worldwide cloud infrastructure service spend. Apple's iPhone accounts for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share. Alphabet's Google was responsible for a 91% share of global internet search in March, while wholly owned streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) make up a 90% (or greater) share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is No. 1 globally in online retail market share. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services is the worldwide No. 1 in cloud infrastructure service spend. Meta Platforms owns the most sought-after social media real estate, with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and its other apps collectively attracting almost 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs), and is the only pure-play EV maker to have achieved recurring profits.\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive advantages, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales shows that select lawmakers on Capitol Hill have sent three Magnificent Seven stocks to the chopping block.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 Congress is selling: Nvidia\n\nAlthough Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband have made a small fortune purchasing call options in the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, when it comes to the purchasing and selling of common shares, members of Congress were decidedly sellers of Nvidia stock in 2023. Collectively, $1.76 million shares were sold by lawmakers last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest seller of all, according to data from Capitol Trades, has been House Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA). Between May 5, 2023 and Aug. 14, 2023, five sell orders were executed for Meuser, ranging from just $1,000 to $15,000, up to a sell order of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are three key reasons shares of Nvidia may be headed notably lower.\n\nTo start with, every next-big-thing investment trend since the advent of the internet 30 years ago has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and adoption of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nSecondly, Nvidia has the potential to cannibalize its own pricing power in the coming quarters. The scarcity of its in-demand GPUs drove the price of its A100 and H100 chips into the stratosphere last year. As Nvidia brings more production to market, and new competitors enter the space, GPU scarcity will decline. In turn, Nvidia's gross margin should retrace.\n\nThe third issue, which I believe is Nvidia's biggest hurdle, is that its top four customers (Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet) are all developing in-house GPUs of their own. These Magnificent Seven components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales, and we're probably witnessing a peak in orders from these industry titans. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 Congress is selling: Microsoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress have been steady sellers of is the largest publicly traded company, Microsoft. Though Microsoft is listed on Unusual Whales' heatmap as one of the most-purchased stocks in 2023 ($1.97 million shares bought by lawmakers), members of Congress collectively sold $11.61 million shares. That's a net of $9.64 million worth of Microsoft shares that were sold last year.\n\nWhereas Nvidia had one notable seller, a number of lawmakers couldn't stop selling shares of Microsoft:\n\nHouse Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) dumped between $1 million and $5 million in shares on Jan. 4, 2023. House Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) sold between $250,000 and $500,000 in shares on both March 1, 2023 and Aug. 30, 2023. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) shed $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Microsoft stock on June 20, 2023. House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) sold multiple rounds of Microsoft stock that commonly ranged between five-and-six figures throughout 2023.\n\nThe likeliest reason for this selling is simple profit-taking. Shares of the company gained 57% last year, with the company's investments in AI fueling its ascent.\n\nAnother reason lawmakers may have headed for the exit is Microsoft's valuation. Although Microsoft is an absolute cash cow, it ended April 19 at a multiple of nearly 32 times forward-year earnings. For some context, this is about a 10% premium to Microsoft's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, members of Congress might be concerned about a bubble brewing in the AI space. Microsoft has aggressively invested in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has been incorporating generative AI solutions into Azure. If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, some of Microsoft's valuation premium may be wiped away.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock No. 3 Congress is selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress can't stop selling is social media maven Meta Platforms. Though Meta doesn't appear on Unusual Whales' heatmap of congressional buying activity, it was one of the most-actively sold communication services providers in 2023, with aggregate selling of $2.6 million.\n\nThe culprit for the lion's share of this selling activity in Meta is Michael McCaul, Congress' second most-active stock trader (1,826 trades completed in 2023). In addition to dumping shares of Microsoft on numerous occasions, McCaul sold shares of Meta 16 times last year, based on data provided by Capitol Trades.\n\nAs with Nvidia and Microsoft, profit-taking is a logical reason why lawmakers headed for the exit in 2023. Meta was one of the top-performing megacap stocks last year, with its AI ties clearly providing a boost.\n\nAnother catalyst that may have encouraged members of Congress to pare down their stakes in Meta is the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession. Select predictive indicators and money-based metrics suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy may not be far off. Meta generated close to 98% of its revenue from advertising in 2023, and businesses aren't shy about reducing their ad spending when trouble arises. Although recessions are short-lived, they could hit Meta harder than other Magnificent Seven components.\n\nThe final factor that may be behind Congress' selling of Meta stock is the increasingly competitive social media landscape. The continued popularity of TikTok serves as formidable competition and could result in weaker ad-pricing power for Facebook, the top social media platform in the world.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe McCaul has made a big mistake parting with his shares of Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.\n\nThe relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products.\n\nBalancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late.\n\nThis is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet.\n\nTaking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that \"32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers.\" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere.\n\nOn a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023:\n\nEquity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%.\n\nThe strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top ethical stocks. A couple of top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024\n\nA trader at a stock exchange, vigorously watching the stocks' trends in the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best ethical stocks, we ranked the top 30 most valuable holdings of the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these best ethical stocks, we mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "The House Just Passed the TikTok Ban. Here's What That Means for Meta Stock.",
        "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Saturday that's not good for popular social-media app TikTok. But it may have gone unnoticed by many investors because it was packaged inside of a foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. Because of the bill, TikTok's parent company is faced with the choice of selling its popular app in the U.S. or pulling it from the U.S. market entirely.\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is seen as a clear beneficiary of the TikTok legislation. I'll explain why that's the case but I'll also explain why Meta investors might want to tap the brakes on their enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, let's tap the brakes\n\nI've noted that the TikTok bill made it through the House of Representatives but this doesn't mean it's now a done deal. The bill still has to make it through the Senate. And after that, it has to be signed by President Biden.\n\nGranted, there's bipartisan support for the bill and it passed the House of Representatives with ease. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect it to pass the Senate. From there, comments from President Biden make it sound like he will indeed sign it.\n\nHowever, even if the bill is signed by the president, TikTok wouldn't be in immediate danger of disappearing. Parent company ByteDance would have up to a year to become compliant with the law. By then, it's possible Biden would no longer be the president, suddenly pushing U.S. policy in another direction. Therefore, ByteDance might stall for time.\n\nFinally, ByteDance could sell TikTok. And if it does, the app might not ever leave the U.S. market, leaving the competitive landscape unchanged. This possibility is quite realistic. For example, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok if it goes up for sale.\n\nIn summary, Meta Platforms' shareholders shouldn't celebrate yet. The bill hasn't completely passed yet, ByteDance will have about a year to weigh its options, and TikTok may never disappear in the U.S. anyway if it's sold to a party that can keep it running.\n\nWhy it could be good for Meta\n\nThe company sells hardware products, is pushing research in artificial intelligence (AI), and has big plans for the metaverse. But in 2023, 98% of Meta's revenue came from digital advertising. Therefore, advertising is clearly the most important thing for Meta investors to watch.\n\nDigital advertising depends on user engagement. It doesn't matter how many users a platform technically has. What matters is whether they are using the platform and can be shown an ad. And for Meta, video is a key component of user engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, video watch time for Meta was up a whopping 25% year over year, which shows how quickly user engagement is growing.\n\nIn the Q4 conference call, Meta's CFO Susan Li said that video has lower levels of monetization right now. That's why the company is doing what it can to increase engagement. Regardless of what happens with TikTok, Meta is busy building its AI engine for recommending videos to viewers, which can boost engagement if done well. Given the 25% growth in Q4, there's reason to believe that Meta's AI engine is off to a good start.\n\nHowever, it stands to reason that Meta would additionally benefit if TikTok did disappear from the market. Advertisers spend money on the popular platform. But if it were banned, those dollars would flow elsewhere. And some of that spend would logically wind up with Meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the TikTok bill that just passed in the House of Representatives doesn't mean anything for Meta stock right now and it's possible that it never does. Therefore, Meta investors need to focus on what the company is doing regardless of what happens with TikTok.\n\nThat said, if things with TikTok play out a certain way, then it could eventually give Meta's business a boost. Therefore, it's not entirely immaterial to investors today and it's worth monitoring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Longtime chip analyst Stacy Rasgon recently told Investor’s Business Daily  that the development of AI infrastructure would still be occurring five or ten years from now. Moreover, Rasgon stated that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still benefiting from strong demand for its products, and he thinks that those who believe that the company will experience any sort of downturn soon are mistaken. Rasgon’s comments are certainly positive for AI hardware stocks other than Nvidia which are benefiting a great deal from the AI boom. Here are three such AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to generate high profits for investors.\n\nAstera Labs (ALAB) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. semiconductor company Astera Labs Inc. (ALAB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) develops connectivity chips for cloud and artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nInvestment bank Barclays contended that Astera was poised to benefit from the ongoing proliferation of AI. The bank believes that the firm is ahead of the competition when it comes to providing data centers with the connectivity products that facilitate certain uses of AI which are likely to become much more prevalent over the long-term. Barclays started overage of ALAB with an $85 price target and an “overweight” rating.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe bank expects over 80% of ALAB’s revenue to be generated from products related to AI in 2024. As a result, I expect the firm to benefit tremendously from the continued, rapid proliferation of the technology. And in my view, that makes ALAB one of the best AI hardware stocks to buy now.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) provides many types of top-notch AI hardware and AI chips, including a new ethernet switch. AVGO also offers a chip whose neural network helps it avoid AI workloads from getting too dense and slowing down. Further, the company launched Jericho3-AI switch chips last year which are competitive with the more commonly used AI switch chips. Finally, Broadcom is selling custom AI chips to the large cloud infrastructure players.\n\nThe firm’s strategy appears to be working as its revenue jumped 34% versus the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, its earnings per share advanced 6% year-over-year to $10.99. Moreover, the firm says that it expects AI products to represent 35% of its sales this year. And it expects its financial results to be significantly boosted by higher demand for its AI products.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Broadcom has reported that it has recruited a second major customer for its AI ASIC chips. According to Japanese bank Mizuho, that customer is Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nDespite the market’s poor reaction to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s (NYSE:TSM) first-quarter results, they were actually quite good. The firm’s top-line jumped 13% versus the same period a year earlier to $18.87 billion. Plus, its net income increased 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. Moreover, the chip maker expects its top-line to rise by an impressive total of 20% to 25% this year.\n\nTSM reported that it was benefiting from strong sales of its high-performance computing chips which are used to create AI. According to CEO C.C. Wei, almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address their demands for energy efficient computing power.\n\nIn the wake of TSM stock’s recent pullback, its enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is a very low 0.56 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) hype is fueling the market to new highs. As per a report from PwC, AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. And the greatest economic gains will be in China and North America. Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new highs driven by the soaring “Magnificent Seven”. If you are not investing in the multibagger AI stocks, you are missing out on big gains.\n\nThese companies continue to dominate the market and remain the best in the industry. However, other AI companies are overlooked right now and could become multi-baggers in the long term. If you missed the chance to own one of the Magnificent Seven, you can still buy AI stocks that are set to grow.\n\nLet’s take a look at three AI stocks that are multi-baggers in the making. These companies have made big moves in 2023 and could be on a roll this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn emerging leader in the big data space, PalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) sold its products to the government for many years. However, after it announced the AI platform (AIP), changes began for the company.\n\nTo promote the platform, the tech company offered boot camps which helped convert the leads into clients. Palantir Technologies managed to close 103 deals worth at least $1 million in the fourth quarter. Also, the management mentioned that there was a backlog of bootcamps. These may continue to drive revenue growth.\n\nThe success of its AI platform has helped PLTR stock soar 158% in the year and 26% year-to-date (YTD). Trading at $22 today, the stock has pulled back lately.\n\nThe company is integrating AI across its products and services. Also, the surge in commercial clients is further proof of the platform’s success. Palantir Technologies saw a 70% surge in U.S. commercial revenue in Q4, leading to a 19% stock surge.\n\nFor the first quarter, management is aiming for revenue in the range of $612 – $616 million, up from $608 million in Q4. Palantir Technologies is set to report results on May 6.\n\nGenerating significant revenue from government contracts, a Palantir Technologies investment can be a safe way to dip your toes into AI. Thus, it’s one stock that can double your money by 2025.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is leaving no stone unturned to grow its market share. After launching MI300X, the company recently unveiled new chips to beat the competition.\n\nCalling them the most powerful chips for business PCs, the company said that its Ryzen Pro 8040 processors and Ryzen Pro 8000 processors are built with the latest nanometer technology.\n\nAlso, AI-enabled PCs can help improve the market for desktops and laptops. Further, the company has strong financials and reported a revenue of $6.17 billion in Q4 with an EPS of 77 cents. For this year, it is aiming for AI chip sales of $3.5 billion.\n\nAlready, AMD has won the confidence of some of the biggest companies. Specifically, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have shown interest in using the MI300X accelerator microchips. Several companies lack time and resources to wait for Nvidia’s chips. So, they consider its biggest competitor, AMD.\n\nTrading at $152 today, AMD is up 69% in the year and 7% YTD. With increasing AI demand, the company could see higher revenue growth. TD Cowen analyst has a price target of $200 over the next 12 months with a buy rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn overlooked AI stock, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has a rich history as legacy software developer. The company is making the most of the AI revolution. Expanding capacity at the current data centers, it stands ready for tremendous growth over the next five years. The company will invest $8 billion through 2034 in Japan for AI infrastructure and cloud services.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle has global expansion plans, striking a partnership with Microsoft to build 100 new data centers. This will help meet the rising demand for Microsoft’s Azure. The union extends across multiple countries. Also, Oracle has entered into a partnership with Palantir to provide cloud infrastructure and AI solutions to companies.\n\nAnd, another interesting partnership with Nvidia allows both companies to join forces to run Nvidia’s applications on Oracle cloud infrastructure. These partnerships show Oracle’s potential and ability to offer solutions that meet changing industry demand.\n\nOracle reported impressive growth in Q3 results with a revenue of $13.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year (YOY), and an operating income of $3.8 billion. Its backlog was up 29% and stood at $80 billion, a record high.\n\nTherefore, I’m optimistic that the company will beat expectations in the upcoming results. Trading at $115, ORCL stock looks undervalued to me and could become a multi-bagger in the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The next few weeks will feature a blur of tech company earnings calls, as everyone from Tesla to Twilio report their financial performance for the first three months of the year.\n\nWall Street will be focused on headline numbers like revenue and earnings per share, as well as any surprises, like Meta’s $50 billion dividend last quarter. It’s easy to get lost in the blizzard of numbers. But oftentimes, there’s one particular item in the report that speaks to the overall health and prospects of the business. Here are a few areas that I’ll be keeping an eye on as the Big Tech earnings season kicks off:\n\nAlphabet: Search advertising may be Google’s big moneymaker, but growth in that business has stalled in the single digits in recent years. The rise of generative AI threatens to further dent the search business—it’s not at all clear whether ads will play as central a role in a world where people get their information by conversing with an AI chatbot. What kind of near-term and medium-term growth prospects does Alphabet’s management foresee for the company’s foundational search business?\n\nMeta: Last quarter, Facebook parent company Meta revealed that China accounted for 10% of its ad revenue as a result of marketing blitzes by big Chinese firms like Shein and Temu. That’s something of a mixed blessing: At a time of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., Meta is running a risk by relying on too much Chinese wind in its ad sails. And with the fate of TikTok in the U.S. up in the air, a fresh surge of Chinese advertisers could be on the horizon for Meta.\n\nMicrosoft: How much lift can AI give Microsoft’s cloud? Microsoft’s Azure business grew 30% year on year in the final quarter of 2023. Six percentage points of that growth came from demand for AI, the company said, noting that it was double the rate in the previous quarter. The AI boost likely won’t double again to reach 12% this quarter—but it will be interesting to see if AI continues to juice customer cloud demand or if last quarter’s 6% pop was just a blip that levels out this quarter.\n\nApple: After four consecutive quarters of declining revenue, Apple finally returned to growth in the last three months of 2023. But there was one notable soft spot: China. Sales in China fell 13% year over year, with the company pointing to a slight dip in iPhone sales as one of the reasons. The situation appears to have gotten worse since then. Research firm Counterpoint estimates that iPhone sales in China fell as much as 19% in the first quarter, while Chinese rival Huawei grew a whopping 69.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd with that, here’s what else is happening in tech today.\n\nAlexei Oreskovic\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is the biggest earnings week of the first quarter earnings season. Over a third of the S&P 500 will report this week including several of the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nBut we’re getting companies from across all industries, including retail, restaurants, gold miners, big oil, large tech, the homebuilders, big pharmaceuticals and railroads.\n\nMost eyes will be on the Magnificent 7 stocks, however, as those are the stocks held by most investors. Several of them are making new all-time highs but one is making a 52-week low.\n\nSeveral also have outstanding earnings surprise track records, with one of the Mag 7 being an earnings all-star with just one earnings miss in the last 5 years.\n\nWill a beat push these mega-caps higher or is all the good news priced in?\n\nThis Week’s Must-See Earnings Charts\n\n1. Visa Inc. (V)\n\nVisa has the best earnings track record in the S&P 500. Not only has it not missed in the last 5 years, Visa hasn’t missed since its IPO in 2008. That’s amazing.\n\nShares of Visa have hit new 5-year highs in 2024 and are up 4.6% year-to-date. It trades with a forward P/E of 27.\n\nShould Visa be on your short list?\n\n2. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla has missed two quarters in a row but the earnings beat or miss hasn’t ever been a focus of Tesla management.\n\nShares of Tesla have fallen 31% year-to-date and have hit new 52-week lows. Yet it’s not cheap. Tesla trades with a forward P/E of 58.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Tesla?\n\n3. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has beat 5 quarters in a row.

        "content": "Tuesday, April 23, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV) and Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+36.2% vs. +11.6%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Elevance Health have outperformed the Zacks Medical Services industry over the past year (+16.4% vs. +2.4%). The company’s revenue growth, fueled by premium rate increases and rising memberships, contributes to its positive trajectory. Strategic acquisitions and partnerships have fortified its business portfolio.\r\n\r\nNotably, a robust Medicare Advantage segment, combined with successful contract acquisitions, is poised to drive future memberships. It increased the 2024 earnings guidance to $37.20 per share, compared with previous year’s $33.14 figure. The Carelon business is a key contributor to its success. It utilizes excess capital to boost shareholder value.\r\n\r\nHowever, its rising expenses continue to put pressure on margins. Its high balance sheet debt is reducing financial flexibility. Also, its declining free cash flow is a concern. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elevance Health here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Canadian Natural Resources have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - Canadian industry over the past year (+31.5% vs. +17.2%). The company’s balanced and diverse production mix facilitates long-term value and reduces the risk profile. Canadian Natural’s acquisition of Athabasca Oil Sands project in 2017 has added significant value to its asset base and buoyed the production prospects.\r\n\r\nNotably, lower capital needs and improving operational efficiencies have enabled the company to generate significant free cash flow. What’s more, the company remains committed to investor friendly moves by the way of dividend payout and stock buybacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Canadian Natural is set to face debt maturities each year out till 2027. Further, the C$3.25-billion term loan to fund the Devon Energy asset buy has worsened the company’s debt-to-capital ratio and led to higher interest outgo. The interplay of these factors accounts for the cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Canadian Natura Resources here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Coca-Cola Company (KO), The Progressive Corporation (PGR) and Hess Corporation (HES).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market rally on April 22. Cramer said that when you have many down days you can almost always expect a bounce back. Cramer was surprised that the market \"shrugged off\" Verizon's weak earnings which according to him was \"disappointing\" in every category, including cash flows. Cramer highlighted Tesla's continuous declines despite the company's latest announcement of price cuts and layoffs. Tesla's competitors Ford and GM, on the other hand, gained, with the former gaining 6%.\n\nPeople Do Not Want Tesla Cars, Cramer Says\n\nJim Cramer commented on Tesla's declines and said that people \"still want cars\" but they don’t want Teslas or \"even EVs in general.\" Cramer revealed that his Charitable Trust owns a stake in Ford, which according to him, has the \"best non-electric lineup including hybrids.\" Cramer highlighted that Ford is one of the cheapest stocks in the S&P 500 and the latest jump in the stock shows the market is willing to buy cheap stocks.\n\nAnother reason behind the latest market rally was financials stocks. Cramer said Bank of America and JPMorgan were impressive, but \"nothing comes close\" to American Express.\n\nCramer Calls Nvidia a \"Hideous Stock\" Because of Recent Losses\n\nCramer also talked about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), his favorite AI stock which has fallen off the cliff recently. Cramer urged his viewers to \"listen\" and \"don’t laugh\" has he analyzed the latest Nvidia moves. Cramer admitted NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a \"hideous\" stock lately.\n\n\"Nvidia has gone from being the start of the show to being the goat of the game, and I'm not talking about the greatest of all time.\"\n\nCramer said Nvidia's stock may have finally become \"cheap enough to start tempting people.\" However, Cramer said many high-multiple stocks roared back in the latest rally. He said if NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) hadn’t bounced back in the recent rally, it would have been a \"horrible sign\"\n\nHowever, Cramer reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s business remains strong. Nvidia is down about 13% over the past one month.\n\nCramer also mentioned Meta and Alphabet's gains, saying TikTok's ban could give a boost to Meta's numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer Says \"Punishment\" is Coming\n\nCramer said that he's expecting a W-shaped market movement in the next few days. He warned investors that the \"punishment\" will come, even though the current rally could last for about 10 days. 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. Cramer recommends investors to sell some of these stocks, and urges a wait-and-see approach for others. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nJim Cramer recently talked about Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) and how Ken Griffin's Citadel targeted Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) in a statement, calling Trump's media business a \"loser.\" Cramer said Griffin can't seem to stay out of controversies, referring to his shorting of GameStop shares which triggered a battle between retail investors and short-selling hedge fund firms.\n\nCramer subtly agreed with Citadel's statement which called Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) \"basically a joke.\"\n\n\"I don’t know.. it is kind of a joke\"\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on DJT, he recommends buying Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the long term.\n\n9. Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nSmall modular reactors company Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is advising investors to stay away from. Answering a question about whether Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) should be bought on the back of increasing power demand following AI datacenter boom, Cramer said he believes \"no power company can make money off of it\" so you should \"better buy\" Vertiv or Eaton.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 14 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR).\n\n8. Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nHere is what Jim Cramer said when he was asked about Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN), the Massachusetts-based  aerogel insulation products company.\n\n\"This thing is up so big, and what a great opportunity to sell the stock of a money-losing company after you've made a lot of money.\"\n\nCramer urged investors to \"take the profit\" from their investments in Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN), whose shares are up a whopping 165% over the past one year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 17 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN). The biggest stakeholder of Aspen Aerogels Inc (NYSE:ASPN) during this period was Andrew N. Wiener's Samjo Capital with a $36 million stake. Hedge funds are also buying Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n7. MarineMax Inc (NYSE:HZO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nJim Cramer thinks investing in recreational boat and yacht retailer company MarineMax Inc (NYSE:HZO) is \"too risky\" as of now.\n\n\"I know the multiple is really low, but I just don’t like that sector of the market at this moment.\"\n\nUnlike Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which Cramer recommends for the long term, the CNBC host is bearish on HZO.\n\nDuring an earnings call in January, MarineMax talked about guidance:\n\n\"Based on our industry unit expectation and our results to date, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in 2024. We are seeing increased discounting in the industry and the industry product margins are moderating to prepandemic levels. While our profitability was below our expectations this quarter, we continued to reach the long-term benefits of our higher-margin strategy and are confident in our ability to maintain consolidated margins in the low to mid-30s. Thinking ahead, it’s worth noting that in the March 2023 quarter, we had lower interest costs driven by lower rates and lower inventory than we will have this quarter. Factoring all this in, we now expect our adjusted net income per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.70 for fiscal 2024 with adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $215 million.\n\nWe are using an annual expected tax rate of approximately 27% and a share count of 23.1 million in our assumptions. Looking at current trends, with the seasonally smallest quarter of the year behind us, we are cautiously encouraged by the reasonably strong start to the winter boat show season.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nAce River Capital made the following comment about MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE:HZO) operates a vertically integrated boat and yacht company with manufacturing, retail sales, financing, insurance, all the way down to maintenance and storage operations. The company has a strong portfolio of marinas and is in a great position to be able to roll up additional retailers, marinas, and storage facilities. I do wish the company would provide more information on its capital allocation strategy and how it thinks about the decisions to target retailers, real estate/marinas, or share repurchases. This would provide foresight for investors and keep management accountable for decisions. RCI Hospitality has a capital allocation strategy slide mentioned earlier in this letter, that is the type of thing I would love to see from MarineMax . I will attempt to bring this up to management. Until I can gather more information about the capital allocation strategy this will remain my lowest conviction holding but trading at just 3x cash with a strong position in the high margin/high cost segments of the boating industry I like the entry point.”\n\n6. IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nQuantum computing company IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks you should stay away from according to Jim Cramer. A caller asked Jim Cramer during the Lightning Round segment of his program about IO NQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ). Cramer said it's a tough time for tech stocks as they are in a \"free fall\" including the companies that are doing \"incredibly well.\" In this environment, Cramer said money-losing  stocks like IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ) are a \"sell, sell, sell.\"\n\nOf the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database, 21 hedge funds reported owning stakes in IONQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ).\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Can These 3 Internet Software Stocks Hit Q1 Earnings Targets?",
        "content": "The Zacks Internet Software industry is anticipated to have witnessed robust performance in the first quarter of 2024, driven by the accelerated demand for digital transformation and ongoing cloud migration. The industry has been gaining from the increasing need for hybrid operating environments in working, learning and diagnosis software, as well as cybersecurity applications. The increasing deployment of AI and generative AI is driving prospects.\r\n\r\nNotable players like Perfect Corp. PERF, Meta Platforms META and 2U TWOU are likely to have benefited from steady subscription and advertising revenues, which are likely to have fueled top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The pay-as-you-go model and the affordability of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery model, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, have been major catalysts.\r\n\r\nThe cloud-based applications offered through this model are not only easy to use but also significantly reduce the need for specialized training, thereby lowering expenses and driving profitability.\r\n\r\nAs businesses increasingly adopt hybrid operating environments, the demand for solutions that support such setups has become noteworthy. Internet software companies have responded to this trend by enhancing their offerings to secure cloud platforms amid the rising incidences of cyber-attacks and hacking, further fueling the demand for web-based cybersecurity software.\r\n\r\nThe Internet Software space is a crucial component of the broader technology sector, which encompasses 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 32% of His Portfolio Invested in These 3 Incredible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper is one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street. He founded Appaloosa Management in 1993 and eventually became a self-made billionaire. Over the last few years, he's returned much of his clients' funds, so Appaloosa is now primarily his own personal capital.\n\nSince Appaloosa is technically an institutional investor, investing on behalf of others, it's required to file form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter when it holds more than $100 million in assets. Appaloosa ended 2023 with $5.8 billion in assets under management.\n\nThanks to those public filings, we can get a glimpse at exactly how Tepper invests his money. And he's betting big on three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in 2024. Nearly one-third of his portfolio is tied up in these companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms (11%)\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the company behind leading social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. The company boasts nearly 4 billion unique users across its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp and Messenger. It's also developing augmented and virtual reality technology within its Reality Labs division.\n\nMeta's been investing heavily in artificial intelligence for the last few years. That shows up in its massive capital expenditures (capex), which topped $28 billion last year. That's a pullback from the $32 billion it spent in 2022.\n\nAll those capital expenditures are going toward building data centers to train AI algorithms such as its LLaMA large language model, which is now on its third version.\n\nMeta uses its AI algorithms to improve content and advertising recommendations within its Facebook and Instagram's Feed, Stories, and Reels. The advancements in AI turned Reels from a drag on revenue performance to additive in a shorter time frame than management expected.\n\nWhat's more, Meta can apply its generative AI capabilities to the ad-creation process, making it easier for marketers to test new ads on the platform and improve conversions. That boosts total advertisers and the amount they're willing to pay.\n\nMeta shares started strong in 2024, zooming 42% higher. But they were arguably very undervalued before the company's blowout fourth-quarter earnings and new dividend announcement.\n\nWith shares currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 24.5, the stock looks fairly valued. In fact, shares may still have a lot of room to grow when you consider that analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an average rate of 24.5% over the next five years, giving it a PEG ratio of 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (11%)\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) vaulted to the forefront of the AI conversation when it added $10 billion to its investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023. It's now leveraging that position to fuel its cloud computing and enterprise software businesses.\n\nMicrosoft Azure makes it easy to deploy AI applications using a growing number of large language models. Microsoft now counts 53,000 Azure AI customers, up more than 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nAs a result, it's been growing revenue faster than its competitors in the space. Azure sales climbed 30% in Microsoft's second quarter. By comparison, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet saw their cloud computing segments grow just 13% and 26%, respectively. Granted, Amazon's cloud business is bigger than Microsoft's, but Google Cloud remains the smallest of the three and is falling further behind.\n\nMicrosoft is also incorporating generative AI capabilities into its enterprise software through its Copilot features. Developers can use its Github Copilot to help them code more efficiently. The company is developing Copilot applications for sales, customer service, healthcare, retail, and everyday productivity tasks in its Microsoft 365 suite. As it taps into its existing user base of millions, it could sell a lot of Copilot subscriptions.\n\nMicrosoft's stock isn't cheap but may be worth the price. It trades at a forward P/E of around 30.9. While analysts see strong revenue growth and slight margin expansion over the next five years, they still only expect 15.4% earnings growth.\n\nBut when you combine Microsoft's strong cash position and massive free cash flow supporting its dividend and buybacks, it might be worth following Tepper into some shares of the most valuable company on the market.\n\nAmazon (10%)\n\nAmazon is best known for its incredibly popular online marketplace, where its Prime members can receive millions of items within 24 hours with just the click of a button. While the company continues to grow its share of the e-commerce market, its advertising and cloud computing businesses are sure to fuel its earnings growth for years to come.\n\nAmazon is the market leader in public cloud services. While Microsoft is making significant headway, cutting into Amazon's market share recently, the e-commerce leader is quickly reestablishing itself. After Amazon Web Sales (AWS) slowed to 12% in mid-2023, the segment started showing signs of life, accelerating to 13% growth in the fourth quarter. That's still well behind the competition, but Amazon is investing heavily to catch up in AI.\n\nThe company invested $4 billion in Anthropic, gaining more access to its leading generative AI technology. It introduced Amazon Bedrock last year, making it easy for new and existing AWS customers to launch generative AI applications using a number of large language models.\n\nIt's also developing its own chips designed for training AI models and deploying them in applications. These chips are more power efficient than general graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, which has seen its prices skyrocket amid the AI boom.\n\nManagement believes we're still in the very early innings of the generative AI boom, so there's plenty of time for it to catch up. It's investing with a long-term mindset, which has worked out well for Amazon in the past.\n\nShares of Amazon currently trade at a price-to-sales ratio of around 3.3. Due to the company's double-digit revenue growth and expanding margin expectations, investors will pay a fair price for the stock today. But if Amazon can start winning back share in cloud computing, it could easily outperform the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The primary focus of Investor’s Business Daily’sIBD Big Cap 20 list is large-capitalization stocks. The reasoning behind these picks is that they are steady, conservative equities that investors can expect consistency from. Some of the firms on this list even provide dividends. The Big Cap 20 includes names that can rally a great deal despite their large size. Indeed, many of the names over the years, such as ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) have all rallied tremendously during their tenures on the IBD’s Big Cap 20. Here are three stocks from the IBD’s Big Cap 20 that look poised to deliver outsized gains for investors in the medium term and the long term.\n\nMartin Marietta (MLM) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMartin Marietta (NYSE:MLM) provides raw construction materials. The company is benefiting from Washington’s huge infrastructure spending and from U.S. factories being built.\n\nIndeed, British bank HSBC wrote that the firm would benefit from its pricing power as a result of Washington’s infrastructure initiatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment bank Jeffries recently identified Martin Marietta as one of 12 high-quality mid-cap names to buy. The bank believes that mid-cap names have been beaten down and are poised to rally.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, MLM’s top line climbed 9% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.6 billion, while its earnings per share from continuing operations soared 54% year-over-year to $4.63.\n\nMLM has an attractive enterprise/EBITDA ratio of 18 times.\n\nThe combination of MLM’s strong growth catalysts and low valuation makes it one of the more attractive members of IBD’s Big Cap 20.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it. Stocks to Buy in March\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) specializes in mining gold. As gold prices have climbed, AEM stock has gone along for the ride, rising 29% over in the last three months.\n\nThere are many reasons for the large gains in gold prices. Among these catalysts are relatively high inflation along with America’s huge, rapidly rising debt. The continuous, sizeable purchases of the metal by many of the world’s central banks have also caused an increase in gold pricing. None of these catalysts looks likely to weaken significantly anytime soon, so gold prices are likely to continue to climb for the foreseeable future, further lifting AEM in the process.\n\nAlso important is a little-noticed development: the very popular retail chain Costco (NYSE:COST) is now selling $100 million to $200 million in gold and silver monthly, Wells Fargo estimated recently. Costco’s decision to sell the metals is enabling America’s middle class to invest in them more easily than ever before. I believe that this initiative has set up a virtuous cycle in which the middle class is buying the metals, causing their prices to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAEM has an attractive trailing price-earnings ratio of 16 times and a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT) provides monitoring systems and power management products for data centers.\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of AI causing the demand for data centers to jump, VRT’s top and bottom lines have soared in recent quarters. Since the utilization of AI will continue to increase very rapidly for many years, VRT’s long-term outlook is strong.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street appears to be falling in love with the name, as many investment banks have recently issued positive notes on the stock.\n\nFor example, Bank of America recently added VRT to its list of “best investment ideas,” while Oppenheimer started coverage of the name with an “outperform” rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI and NOW. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 \"Magnificent 7\" Stocks Ready to Report Earnings. Here's What to Expect\n\nAmid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\n\nNVIDIA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of NVIDIA fell 13.6% last week and are down about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.\n\nApple and Microsoft lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms and Alphabet erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\n\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. First-quarter earnings for Magnificent Seven are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\n\nProfits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nHere, we discuss three companies from the Magnificent Seven — Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — that are set to release earnings this week. Meta Platforms will report on Apr 24, while Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%). Shares of META have surged about 22% over the past three months.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -3.36% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 14.69% and modest revenue growth of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company's earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 7.22%. Earnings are expected to increase 27.4%, while revenues are expected to grow 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 18%) and has climbed 5.5% in the past three months.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Should You Buy META (META) Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms META is slated to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 24, 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $4.32, while the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.35, leading to an Earnings ESP of +0.62% for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.\n\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the last 7 days and 5 cents over the past month. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information — is a good indicator for the stock.\n\nLet’s analyze the Meta stock in detail.\n\nBull Case Scenario\n\nWhile Meta is sharing its foundational \"Llama\" models with developers, proprietary data and product implementations are still private. Meta's user data gives it an edge over peers in training their AI models. This user advantage helps Meta create engaging AI experiences, which leads to increased user engagement and higher advertising revenues, favoring advertiser ROI.\n\nReels are acting as a tailwind, per some market watchers. A TikTok ban would be a win for this segment’s monetization. Moreover, ad spending growth has remained resilient, buoyed by higher prices.\n\nPer Skai, a leading omnichannel advertising platform, average cost-per-click (CPC) increased 13% year over year in paid search of the digital marketing field in Q4 of 2023. Meta proved to be a key beneficiary of this trend. Spending on product ads on Meta grew massively in Q4 of 2023. We expect this winning trend to have continued in Q1 of 2024.\n\nFactors to Boast About\n\nThe stock currently belongs toa top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%) and a top-ranked Zacks sector (top 31%).\n\nSolid Track of Beating Analysts’ Estimates on Non-Financial Metrics\n\nMeta’s advertising revenues topped analysts’ estimates in the last four quarters for all geographic sectors, except US & Canada. In the previous six quarters, advertising revenues missed only in the September quarter in North America.\n\nDaily Active Users (DAUS) worldwide also topped analysts’ estimates in the last for quarters. Monthly Active Users (MAUS) worldwide also surpassed analysts’ estimates in three out of the last for quarters.\n\nWorldwide average revenue per user (ARPU) breezed past analysts’ consensus estimates in the past four quarters, while the same metric emerged winner for North America in the past five quarters.\n\nUpbeat Growth Compared With the Industry\n\nThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial earnings growth of 63.6% from the prior-year quarter, way higher than the industry’s growth rate of 28.8%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6% versus 16.7% of the industry. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The estimated five-year growth rate of Meta is 19.5% versus 17.1% growth rate of the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Stock Currently Enjoying High Momentum\n\nThe Meta stock has an upbeat Momentum Score of A and returned about 40% this year and 127% in the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCompelling Valuation\n\nP/E (TTM) of Meta stands at 30.9X versus 34X possessed by the underlying industry. P/E of the upcoming year of the stock stands at 23.8X versus the 28.6X ratio held by the industry.\n\nWall of Worry\n\nSome valuation metrics like price/sales, price/book and price/cash flow are a little overvalued. Price/Sales of the stock is 9.4X versus 5.2X possessed by the industry. Price/book ratio of the Meta is 8.0X versus 5.3X recorded by the industry. Price/Free Cash Flow is 28.7X versus 21.7X reported by the industry.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors should not be bogged down by the slightly rich valuation of some metrics. Meta’s huge global presence with a dependable user base, continuous innovation on the advertising front, which could boost monetization, a deeper focus on e-commerce advertising solutions, AI initiatives, a strong presence in virtual reality and the Metaverse make the stock a buy.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Magnificent Meta a Compelling Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "After a dismal 2022, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms, Inc. META made a terrific comeback last year. Meta Platforms delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and joined the trillion-dollar market capitalization at the onset of 2024.\n\nA rebound in Meta Platforms’ flagship ad business and its cost-cutting initiatives further bolstered expectations for bullish first-quarter 2024 earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 24, after market close.\n\nMeta Platforms is estimated to report earnings per share of $4.32 for the first three months of 2024, more than $2.64 a year ago, representing a jump of 63.6%. Moreover, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta Platforms’ shares, rightfully, soared around 37% in the first quarter. However, its shares are trading in the negative territory in April, more or less matching the broader market. Skeptics doubt Meta Platforms’ big spending goal on generative AI and the Metaverse as it may impact the company’s financials.\n\nYet, Meta Platforms’ current hiccup is momentary. Instead, the company remains a market darling. This is because Meta Platforms’ digital advertising business is gaining strength from e-commerce firms in China.\n\nDiscount shopping app, Temu has given stiff competition to Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN in China as it racked up solid sales in the past year. Now, PDD Holdings Inc. PDD, Temu’s parent company has extensively used Meta Platforms’ Instagram and Facebook platforms with ads for Temu, something that bodes well for the social media behemoth.\n\nInterestingly, Meta Platforms is currently teaming up with Amazon. Links will be provided on the Instagram and Facebook platforms for users to purchase goods from Amazon. This initiative will boost Meta Platforms’ ad revenues as well as improve transaction growth for Amazon. What’s more, competing rivals could further strike similar deals with Meta Platforms, a tailwind for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representative’s inclination toward banning TikTok from operating in the United States should stand in good stead for Meta Platforms. TikTok is suspected of becoming a security threat as it influences public opinion in the United States. Nonetheless, banning TikTok will compel its audience to shift toward Instagram reels, and advertisements will follow.\n\nStatista, meanwhile, reported that the AI market is expected to see a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 and 2030. Meta Platforms, thus, has joined the AI frenzy, which should help its shares gain traction. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg recently launched the Meta.ai chatbot. Meta Platforms has also launched an updated AI chip to enhance its data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms’ bet on Metaverse somehow didn’t look good for the company. Its Reality Labs division has been incurring losses for quite some time. But lately, with the launch of Quest 3, Meta Platforms’ VR headset, sales from the Reality Labs division are poised to improve. Lest we forget, Mark Zuckerberg has already downplayed the threat from Apple Inc’s AAPL Vision Pro headset.\n\nThe current year is also the ‘Year of Efficiency’ for Meta Platforms. The company has slashed umpteen jobs to streamline its operation. Such cost-cutting measures will help the company mitigate macroeconomic headwinds, apprehensions of a recession and higher interest rates. The company, anyhow, is cash-rich making it unperturbed to market upheavals. Meta Platforms’ cash and cash equivalents were $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, up from $61.12 billion on Sep 30, 2023.\n\nTo top it, the net profit margin of Meta Platforms is nearly 29%, way higher than the 20% mark, indicating a high margin. In other words, the company has kept its operating expenses under check and is worthy of generating the necessary profit from sales. In reality, Meta Platforms have been efficiently generating profits since it has a return on equity of 29.5%, which is typically considered good.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms enjoy an economic moat. Almost half of social media platform handlers globally are using Meta Platforms’ applications. This diversification and huge audience base protect the company from any downside risk.\n\nThe social media giant also began paying dividends recently, and a passive income surely shouldn’t bother any razor-sharp investor. Meta Platforms’ annual dividend yield is 0.42%, which is less, but the company is just starting. Thus, Meta Platforms’ shares have more upside left in the near future and is currently a compelling buy.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM) Meta Platforms, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta Platforms’ expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 35.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next years is 18.2% and 12.8%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta Platforms’ current-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. Meta Platforms currently possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nAre These Mag 7 Members Buys Ahead of Earnings?\n\nWe have entered the heart of the 2024 Q1 earnings cycle with a notably stacked earnings schedule on deck for this week. The period has primarily been positive so far, with the big banks' results not causing any spooks.\n\nAnd concerning this week's busy docket, two 'Mag 7' members – Alphabet and MetaPlatforms – are scheduled to unveil quarterly results.\n\nAlphabet will report after the market close on April 25th, whereas Meta will report on April 24th after the market close. Shares of each have been considerably strong in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 handily.\n\nAdvertising revenue is a significant chunk of each company's business and will undoubtedly be a focal point in the releases. But how does everything stack up heading into their quarterly releases? Let's take a closer look at what's expected.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe outlook for Meta's upcoming release has turned visibly bright, with the $4.32 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 20% since the end of January and suggesting 63% year-over-year growth. Favorable cost-cutting measures have aided the company's profitability picture in a big way.\n\nConcerning Advertising revenue, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $35.6 billion, suggesting a sizable 27% growth rate from the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our expectations for this metric as of late, with the most recent beat totaling $827 million.\n\nDespite their strong run, shares aren't valuation stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 22.8X nearly in line with the 21.6X five-year median and well beneath highs of 31.5X in 2020. In addition, the current PEG ratio of 1.2X reflects that investors aren't overpaying for the forecasted growth.\n\nShares have had a tough showing over the last month, losing roughly 5% alongside the S&P 500's 4% decline. Further weakness post-earnings could be a great purchase point for investors if the company's guidance is solid, which will keep analysts' revisions positive.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAlphabet\n\nAnalysts haven't shown as much positivity for Alphabet's upcoming release compared to META, with the $1.49 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up a modest 2% since the end of January. The company's forecasted growth remains strong, expected to post 28% earnings growth on nearly 14% higher sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $60.1 billion, 10% higher than the year-ago mark of $54.5 billion. The company fell short of the consensus estimate in its latest release by $105 million, snapping a previous streak of positive surprises on the metric.\n\nLike META, shares aren't overly stretched concerning valuation, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple nearly in line with the five-year median and well beneath highs of 32.6X in 2021. The PEG ratio works out to 1.4X, again in line with the five-year median and beneath five-year highs of 1.9X.\n\nShares have displayed relative strength over the last month, gaining 4% in value compared to the S&P 500's 4% decline. Favorable commentary from the release concerning AI developments and advertising trends can help keep the stock's momentum positive, though it is critical to follow analysts' revisions post-earnings.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with a wide variety of companies scheduled to report quarterly results.\n\nBoth Alphabet and Meta have continued their momentum in 2024, outperforming handily. Analysts have been positive for both companies' quarterly releases, though positive revisions are much more pronounced within META.\n\nPost-earnings weakness could be prevalent given the recent strong runs, though both companies' fundamentals continue to make them an attractive long-term play.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Good morning. With Meta set to report Q1 earnings on Wednesday, Fortune spoke with a top analyst to get a better sense of what investors may be looking for in the firm's latest quarterly report.\n\nIn a recent note to investors, Scott Devitt of Wedbush Securities, while keeping his outperform rating on Meta, raised his price target to $570 from $520, while also noting that Meta provided notably strong forward guidance for Q1.\n\nIt's a forecast bolstered by the company's strength in digital advertising and more internet users turning to Meta’s apps. According to Wedbush’s latest Consumer Internet Survey, which included responses from more than 1,000 people in the U.S., YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram are the most likely to see increased user engagement this year, and that's with over 80% of respondents saying they already use a Meta product (Facebook, Instagram, or Whatsapp) multiple times per day.\n\nIn Q4 2023, Meta’s “family of apps” ad revenue was $38.7 billion, up 24% from a year earlier. “Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming,” CFO Susan Li said on Meta's Feb. 1 earnings call. That advertising boost helped total revenue to grow 25% year-over-year to $40.1 billion for the quarter, up from $32.2 billion.\n\nSocial media companies have been top of mind. On Saturday, the House passed legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. if the platform’s China-based owner, ByteDance, doesn’t divest its ownership stake within a year.\n\nWedbush’s survey also asked consumers who regularly use TikTok which social media app they'd turn to as a potential replacement, with 60% pointing to either Facebook or Instagram as the most likely alternatives. After Facebook and Instagram, 19% of those surveyed said they'd replace TikTok with YouTube.\n\nConsistent with the survey results, Devitt said, “We would expect Meta to be the primary recipient of redistributed TikTok revenue should the company exit the U.S., with Google the likely number two beneficiary.”\n\nGoogle is set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nMaría Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter.\n\nUpcoming event: Fortune's Future of Finance event in New York City will take place on May 16.

        "content": "Meta (META) To Report Earnings Tomorrow: Here Is What To Expect\n\nSocial network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here's what investors should know.\n\nLast quarter Meta reported revenues of $40.11 billion, up 24.7% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 2.4%. It was a strong quarter for the company, with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts' revenue estimates. The company reported 3.98 billion monthly active users, up 6.4% year on year.\n\nIs Meta buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Meta's revenue to grow 26.5% year on year to $36.23 billion, improving on the 2.6% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.36 per share. Meta Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing seventeen upwards revisions over the last thirty days. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Meta's peers in the consumer internet segment, only Netflix has so far reported results, delivering top-line growth of 14.8% year on year, and beating analyst estimates by 1%. The stock was down 3.4% on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Netflix's earnings results here.\n\nInflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the consumer internet stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 6% over the last month. Meta is down 4% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with with analyst price target of $541.2, compared to share price of $482.7.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

This along with the plausibility that generative AI will optimize various advertising elements is reason to be higher on social media stocks going into their Q1 reports.\n\nMeta & Pinterest’s EPS Growth\n\nNotably, Meta and Piniterst posted high double-digit EPS growth last quarter and this is thought to have continued during Q1.\n\nWith most of its advertising revenue derived from Facebook, Meta’s portfolio also includes Instagram and WhatsApp Messenger. On Wednesday, Meta’s Q1 earnings are expected at $4.32 per share compared to $2.64 a share in the comparative quarter which would represent a 63% increase (Current Qtr). Furthermore, Meta’s annual earnings are projected to climb 36% this year and are forecasted to expand another 15% in fiscal 2025 to $23.25 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPivoting to Pinterest, the company generates revenue by delivering ads on its website and mobile application which shows its users' visual recommendations based on their interests. Next Tuesday, Pinterest is expected to post Q1 earnings of $0.14 a share versus $0.08 a share in the prior-year quarter which would reflect a 75% increase. Better still, Pinterest is projected to post 23% EPS growth in FY24 with FY25 earnings forecasted to jump another 24% to $1.66 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSnap’s Revenue Growth\n\nAdvertisers' interest in Snap revolves around its popularity with younger generations as its Snapchat application allows users to communicate through short videos and images called snaps. Similar to Meta and Pinterest, Snap is experiencing expansive top line growth that alludes to its future earnings potential despite Q1 EPS expected at an adjusted loss of -$0.05 on Thursday versus $0.01 a share last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, Q1 sales are projected to rise 13% to $1.12 billion. Even better, total sales are forecasted to rise 13% in FY24 and are expected to expand another 15% in FY25 to $5.99 billion. More reassuring, is that high double-digit percentage growth is still forecasted on Snap’s bottom line in FY24 and FY25 despite the anticipated dip in Q1 earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlthough the broader advertising industry will not be immune to inflationary pressures among other economic headwinds, digital marketing has continued to strengthen making now an ideal time to buy Meta Platforms, Snap, and Pinterest stock as their Q1 results approach.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zuckerberg wants more companies to build Meta-powered headsets",
        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is taking a page out of Google’s Android playbook by announcing on Monday that his company will make its Meta Horizon operating system for AR/VR headsets open source. The move means that third-party firms will now be able to use Meta Horizon as the software backbone for their own headsets.\n\nZuckerberg announced the move via Instagram, saying that the next age of computing should be powered by an open software model.\n\n“Our goal is to make it so that the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets,” said Zuckerberg. “So that’s why we're releasing our operating system so that more companies can build different things on it.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\nGoogle’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android operating system is considered an open software model because it allows users to install third-party apps, albeit through a convoluted and annoying process. Windows PCs and Apple’s (AAPL) Macs also offer open software models, letting you download and install any apps you’d like.\n\nApple’s iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Vision Pro, however, are closed, meaning you can only install software from Apple’s App Store. It’s worth noting that Zuckerberg has a long-running distaste for Apple and its closed software model. The CEO has repeatedly criticized the company for not allowing certain app features on the iPhone and introducing privacy options that cut off Meta’s ability to capture user data.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nZuckerberg said Meta is already working with ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft (MSFT) on plans for future headsets, with more companies to follow. Though, he also pointed out that it will likely take a few years for the headsets to hit the market.\n\nThe plan, so far, seems to be for Meta’s partners to develop headsets for specific use cases. Meta currently offers its Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Zuckerberg pointed to an example of a lightweight headset that pairs to a computer on your desk dedicated to productivity work, while another could focus on watching movies and videos and be outfitted with high-resolution OLED displays.\n\nHe also touched on ideas for fitness-focused headsets built with lightweight, sweat-wicking materials, as well as an Xbox-style headset that connects to Microsoft’s Game Pass service and a controller to let gamers play anywhere they want. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a company try to build out an AR/VR ecosystem with third-party manufacturing partners. Microsoft also attempted to get its now-defunct Windows Mixed Reality platform off the ground with manufacturing partners like ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung building headsets powered by the software.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe headsets never caught on, though, and Microsoft is now set to remove the platform entirely from the next big Windows 11 update.\n\nThe AR/VR headset market is still a relatively niche technology segment, even among teens. According to Piper Sandler’s most recent Taking Stock with Teens survey, 33% of teens surveyed own a VR device, but only 4% use it on a daily basis. Another 13% said they use their headsets weekly, while a whopping 56% said they seldom use them. What’s more, 32% of teens said they aren’t interested in and have no plans to buy headsets.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg avoided a cage match with Elon Musk but got a jab in anyway by passing him on the billionaires list",
        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never actually made it into the ring, but Zuckerberg still dealt a blow to the Tesla CEO by surpassing him on the list of the world’s richest people.\n\nZuckerberg is now the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $171 billion, jumping above No. 4 Musk, who has a net worth of $168 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Meta CEO has gotten tens of billions of dollars richer since the start of the year, according to Bloomberg, in part because of the stellar performance of Meta’s shares.\n\nAlthough his official salary for a decade has remained steady at $1, Zuckerberg is Meta’s largest and controlling shareholder, with more than 350 million shares, according to the company’s most recent proxy statement. Meta’s shares have skyrocketed about 40% since January, giving Zuckerberg paper gains of about $49 billion on the shares he owns or controls.\n\nMeanwhile, one of Musk’s main sources of wealth, Tesla stock, is struggling. Shares have plummeted 43% since the start of the year, making it the worst performing company in the S&P 500. Musk owns just over 715 million Tesla shares, according to the company’s most recent proxy statement, and their value dropped by $76 billion since January.\n\nTesla’s lackluster stock performance comes after the company reported its first year-over-year sales decline since the pandemic earlier this month. Over the weekend, the company also cut the price of several vehicles along with its Full Self-Driving software.\n\nEven notable Tesla bulls have recently cast doubt on the company’s direction and are expecting answers from Musk on Tuesday’s earnings call.\n\nBut while Musk’s flagship company backslides, he is still trying to secure a $45 billion pay package, after a judge struck it down in January (when it was worth $56 billion). Musk’s big payday could put him above Zuckerberg by net worth, but it’s unclear whether the package will be approved by shareholders at the company’s proxy meeting in June.\n\nThe two billionaire executives have been at odds for years. In 2016, Meta contracted SpaceX to launch a satellite that would’ve brought internet access to sub-Saharan Africa. The rocket exploded on the journey, prompting Zuckerberg to write on Facebook that he was “deeply disappointed.” After Musk bought Twitter (now X), Zuckerberg was quick to launch Threads, a look-alike competitor, which Musk later called “eerily quiet.”\n\nTheir conflict escalated in June when Musk challenged Zuckerberg in a post on X.\n\n“I’m up for a cage match if he is lol,” he wrote at the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nZuckerberg, who has recently taken an interest in martial arts, seemed to take the challenge seriously and was ready to set up the fight. He later called it off, saying Musk wasn’t serious about getting into the ring.\n\n“Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,” Zuckerberg wrote on Threads. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Earnings Season: Are These Mag 7 Members a Buy?",
        "content": "We have entered the heart of the 2024 Q1 earnings cycle with a notably stacked earnings schedule on deck for this week. The period has primarily been positive so far, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks.\n\nAnd concerning this week’s busy docket, two ‘Mag 7’ members – Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META – are scheduled to unveil quarterly results.\n\nAlphabet will report after the market close on April 25th, whereas Meta will report on April 24th after the market close. Shares of each have been considerably strong in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 handily. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdvertising revenue is a significant chunk of each company’s business and will undoubtedly be a focal point in the releases. But how does everything stack up heading into their quarterly releases? Let’s take a closer look at what’s expected.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe outlook for Meta’s upcoming release has turned visibly bright, with the $4.32 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 20% since the end of January and suggesting 63% year-over-year growth. Favorable cost-cutting measures have aided the company’s profitability picture in a big way. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Advertising revenue, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $35.6 billion, suggesting a sizable 27% growth rate from the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our expectations for this metric as of late, with the most recent beat totaling $827 million. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite their strong run, shares aren’t valuation stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 22.8X nearly in line with the 21.6X five-year median and well beneath highs of 31.5X in 2020. In addition, the current PEG ratio of 1.2X reflects that investors aren’t overpaying for the forecasted growth.\n\nShares have had a tough showing over the last month, losing roughly 5% alongside the S&P 500’s 4% decline. Further weakness post-earnings could be a great purchase point for investors if the company’s guidance is solid, which will keep analysts’ revisions positive.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAlphabet\n\nAnalysts haven’t shown as much positivity for Alphabet’s upcoming release compared to META, with the $1.49 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up a modest 2% since the end of January. The company’s forecasted growth remains strong, expected to post 28% earnings growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $60.1 billion, 10% higher than the year-ago mark of $54.5 billion. The company fell short of the consensus estimate in its latest release by $105 million, snapping a previous streak of positive surprises on the metric.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike META, shares aren’t overly stretched concerning valuation, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple nearly in line with the five-year median and well beneath highs of 32.6X in 2021. The PEG ratio works out to 1.4X, again in line with the five-year median and beneath five-year highs of 1.9X.\n\nShares have displayed relative strength over the last month, gaining 4% in value compared to the S&P 500’s 4% decline. Favorable commentary from the release concerning AI developments and advertising trends can help keep the stock’s momentum positive, though it is critical to follow analysts’ revisions post-earnings.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with a wide variety of companies scheduled to report quarterly results.\n\nAmong the bunch are two ‘Mag 7’ members – Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nBoth stocks have continued their momentum in 2024, outperforming handily. Analysts have been positive for both companies’ quarterly releases, though positive revisions are much more pronounced within META.\n\nPost-earnings weakness could be prevalent given the recently strong runs, though both companies’ fundamentals continue to make them an attractive long-term play.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best multibagger stocks to buy now. To skip the details about our prior multibagger stocks, go to 5 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMultibagger is a term commonly used to describe a stock that has generated returns of over 100%. It was coined by Peter Lynch, former manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments. Lynch used the term in his 1988 book, \"One Up on Wall Street,\" in which he discussed his strategies to identify stocks with the potential to be multibaggers or even ten or twenty-baggers.\n\nPrior Multibaggers Still Making Strides\n\nLast year in July, we made a list of the best multibagger stocks which included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL). These three stocks have been moving on an upward trajectory and even after nine months, they continue to make their investors a lot of money.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been topping charts since the rise of generative AI. After a 239% share price return in 2023, the stock has gained 58.20% year-to-date as of April 19. Additionally, the company has experienced a trailing twelve-month EPS growth of 586.45% and sales growth of 125.85%.\n\nWith the rise of the AI trend, several companies made efforts to either compete with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) or even tried to end their dependence on the company. However, the firm is not slowing down its progress. On March 18, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled the Blackwell GPU architecture that is expected to be 2.5 to 5 times more powerful and efficient than its prior H100 and H200 chips. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang said:\n\n“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing, with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI… Generative AI is the defining technology of our time.

The year ended on an incredible note with revenue yields up nearly 18% in the fourth quarter, and 2024 is in the strongest book position in the company's history from both a pricing and volume standpoint. I am incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well and doing so while achieving strong financial results and propelling our future growth.”\n\nMoreover, analysts are also bullish on Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

DoorDash is a technology-driven marketplace that enables couriers (Dashers) to deliver restaurant and other local orders on-demand to consumers. The company is a market leader in restaurant delivery, a business that continues to gain US market share (with healthy margins) and grow internationally. At the same time, heavy investment in newer businesses has limited company profitability. Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability—something it is not getting credit for by the market. The future near-term profit trajectory from new businesses is unclear, but we view management as very rational with its spending. Either these initiatives will yield additional profitable revenue streams, or they will be deprioritized in the coming years—in both scenarios, we expect solid profit growth over time.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Countries with the Largest Rural Population in the World 11 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy Right Now 10 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent 7\" Stock Earnings Coming Up: What to Expect",
        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of NVIDIA fell 13.6% last week and are down about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.\r\n\r\nApple and Microsoft MSFT lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. First-quarter earnings for Magnificent Seven are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nProfits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\r\n\r\nHere, we discuss three companies from the Magnificent Seven — Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — that are set to release earnings this week.  Meta Platforms will report on Apr 24, while Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%). Shares of META have surged about 22% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -3.36% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 14.69% and modest revenue growth of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nAlphabet\r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter.

Irrespective how the market performs from here, these types of stocks may be in for considerable declines in price.\n\nSeveral of the stocks that have thus far this year been top-performers fit into this category. While in some cases, big run-ups have been justified, there are plenty that can be deemed as situations where shares have moved up “too far, too fast.”\n\nAdmittedly, just because investors have gone overboard about a certain stock, doesn’t mean the market will soon come to its senses.

This year, however, it’s been a different story. Shares in this Mediterranean restaurant chain have been on a tear.\n\nSince January, CAVA stock is up 43%, making it one of this year’s top performing stocks. Chalk up this rally to beat-and-raise quarterly results and an analyst upgrade. Yet while the bulls may be betting that Cava is the next big restaurant growth story, this possibility has become overly priced-in.\n\nCAVA now trades for a staggering 257.2 times forward earnings. Yes, this valuation could be sustainable in the short-term, if sentiment holds. However, with short-interest at fairly moderate levels (15.7% of float), instead of squeezing higher when the company next reports results sometime next month, shares could move lower on “sell the news” profit taking.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpun off from Exelon (NYSE:EXC) in 2022, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is an independent electricity generation company. Over the past year, CEG shares have zoomed 146.9% higher. Year-to-date alone, CEG is up by 57.3%.\n\nA major factor behind the sudden popularity of CEG stock has to do with the company’s “green wave” bona fides. Investors and decision-makers alike have warmed up to the idea of nuclear power’s potential to produce clean energy on a massive scale. Constellation has significant nuclear capacity, so it could strongly benefit from increased demand for zero-emissions nuclear power.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, while some of Constellation’s rally may be justified, it’s possible that the market has gone overboard. Shares now trade at a big premium to other “green wave” utilities stocks, like NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). As any subsequent stumble could drive a de-rating, consider CEG one of the top stocks due for a pullback.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWhile I’ve recently been bullish about Disney (NYSE:DIS), at the same time I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of a pullback for the media conglomerate’s shares sometime down the road.\n\nDIS stock has bounced back in a big way over the past four months. Year-to-date, shares are up by nearly 25%. Sentiment has improved in a big way, thanks largely to promising developments, including progress in making the company’s streaming segment profitable. Nevertheless, after the latest round of enthusiasm, sentiment could soon lean bearish again.\n\nWhy? As Seeking Alpha commentator Value Kicker recently argued, Disney CEO Bob Iger’s cost-focused turnaround strategy will only go so far. If the company fails to get back into growth mode, after running out of fat to trim from its cost structure, shares could pull back in a big way. DIS trades at a massive premium to other “big media” stocks.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) A large General Electric (GE) sign.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, General Electric (NYSE:GE) completed its final spin-off. The former industrial conglomerate has now transformed into an aerospace pure play. Investors have been pleased with this transformation.\n\nGE stock has nearly doubled in the past year. Year-to-date, shares are up by more than 50%. However, with this catalyst now played out, GE may now be one of the stocks due for a pullback. Yes, it’s not only been the restructuring that has made the market bullish about General Electric.\n\nThere is also great optimism about future aircraft component demand. Still, it’s very possible investors are overestimating this potential growth catalyst. Shares today trade for 39 times forward earnings. Possibly now “priced for perfection,” any sort of earnings hiccup or slip-up may lead to a severe correction for the stock. Even as momentum remains on its side, err on the side of caution, and sell GE now.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAs you may know, Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) continued hot run has been driven by the pharma firm’s recently-launched diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nAnticipating that off-the-charts demand for these products will keep on moving the needle for the company’s profitability and sales, LLY stock has kept on cruising to loftier price levels over the past years. Shares have doubled over the past twelve months, and are up nearly 28% year-to-date.\n\nHowever, while the initial phase of the rally may have been justified, the market has arguably gone too far. LLY now trades for 60.2 times forward earnings. Even when taking into account the fact that earnings could nearly double between now and 2026, the Mounjaro/Zepbound upside is clearly accounted for, and then some. With this in mind, if you already own LLY, take profit now, before it’s too late. Otherwise, hold off buying.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another name that I’m bullish on, but concede that it may be one of the stocks due for a pullback. Shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent have been on a hot run since 2023, and this winning streak has continued into 2024.\n\nYear-to-date, META stock is up by 41.8%. Yet while the social media giant has impressed the market with its cost-cutting and AI implementation success, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently argued, the stock could soon experience a post-earnings correction.\n\nEven if the company manages to beat already-high expectations, too many investors may decide to make the earnings release their time to make an exit. Macro worries could also knock down META in the near-term. That’s not to say you need to stay away completely. However, if you’ve been thinking about buying META, there’s no reason to rush.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screen\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of this writing, a sell-off for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) may be starting to take shape. That is, following the company release of its latest quarterly results post-market on April 18, NFLX has pulled back. Until now, NFLX, up 25.4% year-to-date, had been trending up.\n\nThe video streaming powerhouse beat Wall Street forecasts for the quarter. Subscriber numbers were also solid. Alas, NFLX stock still sold off, as the market focused on the major negative with the earnings release: the latest updates to guidance. These suggested that the company’s rate of growth is coming up short of analyst expectations.\n\nInvestors may be willing to price growth stories at high earnings multiples, yet if evidence emerges that this high growth is slowing down, the market typically reacts accordingly. In the case of NFLX, this may mean a continued re-rating to the downside, as investors and analysts walk back expectations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

During the quarter the strategy returned 11.8% net of fees compared to the S&P 500’s 10.6% return.

        "title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Magnificent 7 ETFs Before Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNvidia NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of Nvidia fell 13.6% last week and are down sharply, about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion. The electric car maker posted the worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued its slump in the second quarter as well.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon AMZN shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. Overall, first-quarter earnings for \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nProfits for the \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAmong the group of companies, Tesla is set to report first on Apr 23, followed by Meta Platforms on Apr 24. Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25. Amazon, Apple and Nvidia are expected to come up with earnings on Apr 30, May 2 and May 22, respectively.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter indicates a substantial year-over-year earnings decline of 45.9% and revenue decline of 5%. The earnings track record of the company is not impressive. It delivered a four-quarter negative average earnings surprise of 0.40%. Tesla falls under a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 32%). The electric carmaker is down 29.6% in the last three months (read: Tesla Stock Sinks After a Big Q1 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2. The social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%).

Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 14.69% and modest revenue growth of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months (read: 5 ETFs Leading the Tech Rebound: Will the Rally Continue?).\r\n\r\nAlphabet\r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the earnings surprise being 7.22%, on average. Earnings are expected to increase 27.35%, while revenues are expected to grow 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 18%) and has climbed 5.5% in the last three months.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +11.66% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a whopping year-over-year earnings increase of 164.5% and substantial revenue growth of 11.9% for the to-be-reported quarter.

The stock falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 18%) and has returned about 13% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprise. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year decline of 1.3% for earnings and 5.3% for revenues. Apple belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks Industry (bottom 3%). The stock is down 14.9% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nNvidia\r\n\r\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #1. This videogame-gear specialist saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Nvidia’s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 20.18%, on average, in the last four quarters. Nvidia is expected to post earnings and revenue growth of 403.7% and 236%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. The stock belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks Industry (bottom 32%) and has soared about 28% in the past three months.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to play these stocks with the help of ETFs.

        "content": "Teradyne TER is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24.\r\n\r\nTER benefits from its robust and diversified portfolio particularly with the broader adoption of 3-nanometer technology in the mobility space and the launch of AI-supported smartphones that is expected to drive test demand.\r\n\r\nIn memory tests, the expansion of DDR5 and HBM devices used in data center applications to bolster retooling capabilities is expected to have contributed to its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, Teradyne expects the Robotics segment to be weaker than seasonally in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, an overall weak demand environment and weakness in the hard disk drive (HDD) market are expected to have been headwinds for the company.\n\nTeradyne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Teradyne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTeradyne, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Teradyne, Inc. Quote\n\nFor the first quarter, TER expects revenues between $540 million and $590 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $569.98 million, indicating a decline of 7.70% from the year-ago quarter’s reported value.\r\n\r\nTeradyne anticipates non-GAAP earnings between 22 cents and 38 cents. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 33 cents, unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nTER’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 17.87%.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nTeradyne has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This marked the first year-over-year drop in quarterly deliveries since 2020.\r\n\r\nThe decline was due to “the early phase of the production ramp-up” of its updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory and plant shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, which led to a weeklong production halt in its Germany factory.

Meta is also working on a new gaming-focused Quest headset \"inspired by Xbox\", according to the company's statement.\n\nThe move underscores Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to own the computational platform that powers virtual and mixed-reality (VR & MR) devices, similar to the way Google became a key player in the smartphone market by making its mobile OS Android open source.\n\nIn a video posted on Zuckerberg's Instagram account, he previewed examples of specialized headsets the partners might collaborate to make, like a lightweight one with sweat-wicking materials for exercise, a fully immersive high-resolution one for entertainment and one equipped with haptics for gaming.\n\nASUS's Republic of Gamers is developing a gaming headset and Lenovo is working on a mixed reality headset for productivity, learning, and entertainment using the Horizon OS.\n\nZuckerberg said it may take a few years for these devices to launch.\n\nVR and MR headsets have so far seen limited adoption, mostly from the gaming community and select enterprises who use them for training or remote conferencing.\n\nApple entered the category early this year with its $3,499 Vision Pro headset, which some analysts have said is popular with only select users and enthusiasts.\n\nAlphabet's Google is also reportedly working on an Android platform for VR and MR devices.\n\nMeta said the Meta Horizon OS includes Horizon Store, renamed from Quest Store, to download apps and experiences.

        "title": "Why the Magnificent 7's 'momentum is collapsing'",
        "content": "The run may be over for the seven stocks that drove the lion's share of the stock market rally over the past year.\n\nUBS Investment Bank Chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub downgraded six of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) — from Overweight to Neutral in a new research note on Monday.\n\nHis call comes as the Magnificent 7, whichalso includes Tesla (TSLA), just had its largest weekly market cap loss in history. All seven of the big tech leaders are off their recent highs, as highlighted by a 10% single day-drawdown for Nvidia, its worst one day price performance since March 2020.\n\nGolub, who rates sectors within the S&P 500 (^GSPC) not individual stocks, remains Overweight on technology outside of the six stocks he names in his note. But for the large companies who have grown earnings significantly over the past year, Golub believes the tide may be shifting, and other areas are set to outperform the largest stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Investors attribute the run in mega cap stocks to animal spirits and the impact of AI,\" Golub wrote. \"However, our work indicates that surging earnings momentum (change in forward growth projections) fueled this upside. Unfortunately, this momentum is collapsing.\"\n\nTesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nEarnings for the S&P 500 have largely been driven by earnings growth in the large tech stocks. That's expected to play out again during first quarter reports, with FactSet projecting Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia to combine for earnings growth of roughly 64%. Meanwhile the other 495 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report an earnings decline of 6%.\n\nBut over the course of the year, this is expected to shift. Consensus estimates from FactSet show earnings for those five companies are set to end the year with just shy of 20% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly slower growth than their prior pace. By that point, consensus expects the other 495 companies to be growing earnings by about 17% compared to the year prior, a significant uptick from their current growth rate.\n\n\"Our downgrade of the Big 6—from Overweight to Neutral—is not predicated on extended valuations, or doubts about AI,\" Golub wrote. \"Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks. These forces do not apply to other TECH+ companies or the rest of the market in the same way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift in where earnings are growing the most could be \"disruptive in the near term,\" Golub said. But given increasing signs that the US economy is growing faster-than-expected this year, Golub thinks a broadening out in earnings performance over the next year keeps his 5,400 call on the S&P 500 to end the 2024 in play.\n\n\"This target remains supported by broadly positive fundamentals and a robust economy,\" Golub wrote.

        "title": "3 Stocks Most at Risk of AI’s Alarming Energy Consumption",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a Bitcoin (USD-BTC) moment and the situation could rapidly deteriorate for some of the biggest companies in this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBitcoin miners are energy intensive. Their thousands of computers generate excess heat that must be cooled and dissipated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates miners consume as much as 2.3% of all electricity produced in the U.S. It threatened to cause the segment to crash because of the rising costs. AI is in a similar situation but it could mushroom exponentially very fast.\n\nIn 2021, before the real explosion of AI, the EIA said data centers, one of the biggest AI users, were consuming about 2% of all the electricity produced. It noted they are “one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd AI is an energy hog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2026, or “roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S. alone, Boston Consulting Group estimates AI-powered data centers will consume as much as 7.5% of electric output by 2030, triple what it was in 2022.\n\nThe energy crisis is real because there is not enough capacity available to meet projected demand. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest data center operators for its cloud services business. CEO Andy Jassy told Fortune, “These large language models are so power hungry, and there’s just not enough energy right now.” The e-commerce giant recently purchased a nuclear-powered data center to help offset its electricity demands.\n\nAmazon operates 125 data centers globally but just 24 in the U.S. Below are three other giant data center operators at risk because of AI’s alarming energy consumption.\n\nEquinix (EQIX) corporate building with Equinix (EQIX) logo on it\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates 260 data centers in 71 major metropolitan areas around the globe. It understands the all-consuming nature of artificial intelligence in data centers. Equinix has been using AI-based software to reduce by 9% energy consumption at a Frankfurt data center and plans to roll it out to its other Frankfurt data centers. It was an essential response as Germany introduced an aggressive new law to increase energy efficiency.\n\nIf it wants to fulfill its expansion dreams, Equinix will need to deploy similar strategies elsewhere. The REIT wants to build out its xScale data centers for hyperscale usage. Hyperscalers are supersized cloud services providers like Amazon and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. These are the biggest drivers of AI demand as they seek out AI accelerators to boost their capacity. Google says its AI accounts for almost 15% of its data centers’ energy usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithout money-saving initiatives like this, Equinix could find itself pinched by growing demand of its xScale facilities.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it’s understood Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) need for data centers for its fast-growing Azure cloud service, what might not be as apparent is just how many the tech giant owns and operates itself.\n\nAccording to industry site Dgtl Infra, Microsoft operates 300 physical data centers in 64 regions globally. It is in the process of adding 15 more regions to its constellation, with each region having from one to three individual data centers. Together, Microsoft’s data centers span over 75 million square feet.\n\nMicrosoft needs this web of connectivity as it is one of the most prominent companies diving head-first into AI. Beyond the scalability AI provides Azure, the tech stock has integrated it throughout all of its products and services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, LinkedIn, Skype, Xbox and Outlook.\n\nBecause every facet of Microsoft’s business is tied to AI, the power demands it places on the grid are excessive. It also hints at the next pain point for AI: water consumption, an equally scarce resource. Google’s data centers used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 while Microsoft’s water usage soared 34%.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is the world’s largest data center REIT with 308 locations in 25 countries. As companies continue to transition their data to the cloud, they increasingly turn to DLR to house it. Among its biggest customers are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and hyperscaler Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAs much of the problem as AI is, Digital Realty sees it also being part of the solution. DLR says AI can measure and reduce consumption significantly by intuitively deploying resources at appropriate times. In a 2019 pilot program using its Apollo AI platform, DLR tested conservation methods at two European facilities. It rolled it out to 14 more soon after. Combined, Digital Realty was able to save about 18 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of savings.\n\nThe REIT offers hope that even as AI drives immense demand on energy resources, it can offset that by increasing efficiency. But whether that is possible on a global scale as AI usage increases exponentially remains to be seen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "At US$481, Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Worth Looking At Closely?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Meta Platforms’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $583.80, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Meta Platforms generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Meta Platforms. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in META’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "7 Great Growth Stocks Promising Gargantuan Gains: April 2024",
        "content": "If you’re looking for growth stocks with huge gains for your next investment, there’s really no need to mess around. You want to find the biggest and best names in the market that have a track record in recent quarters of providing extraordinary growth.\n\nWhile investors like Warren Buffett lean toward value stocks – a stock that is fundamentally cheap based on ratios like price-to-earnings or price-to-book, – growth stocks are more about the end result. Some of the names on this list have crazy fundamentals, but they that’s only because their returns are so strong. Growth stocks are those that are growing or expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market or the overall economy.\n\nThese companies are hyper-focused on expanding their businesses, reinvesting earnings into expanding operations or developing new products.  Growth stocks with huge gains can help investors build wealth over the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to identify the best candidates for growth in the market today. And here’s a spoiler alert – you’ve surely heard of many of the high-profile names on this list.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve written about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) a lot in the last few months, and I’m going to continue to beat the drum for this dynamic growth stock. Nvidia is one of the best names you can buy because of its unique position in the semiconductor industry and its key role in fueling the growth of generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nNvidia manufactures about 90% of the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used in generative AI. That’s led to the company soaring in valuation and market capitalization – Nvidia is now the third-most valuable company in the world, with a market cap above $2.1 trillion.\n\nNow Nvidia is going to be even better. It’s replacing the H100 processors currently in use with Blackwell processors that will be four times as powerful as H100 processors.\n\nOne thing to note – NVDA stock is actually down about 6% in the last month because some investors are worried that sales will temporarily falter if customers hold off on new purchases while they wait for the Blackwell processors to go on the market. And maybe that will happen. But I’m taking this brief break as a buying opportunity because I’m convinced that Nvidia has a lot more growth left in it.\n\nNVDA stock remains up 70% this year and more than 200% higher than a year ago. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an overall “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is Nvidia’s top competitor. Truthfully, AMD was left in the dust in 2023 as Nvidia sales skyrocketed. But now AMD is in a position to begin providing an alternative to Nvidia’s chips. And it has a definite advantage in the personal computer market as well.\n\nAMD is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue this year from its Mi300 GPU accelerator. AMD also provides AI-compatible central processing units (CPUs) for the PC market, where it still has a competitive advantage.\n\nAnalysts at Baird expect “comfortable upside” to AMD this year and reiterated its “outperform” rating while setting a $200 price target. That’s a healthy target, particularly since AMD is affected by Beijing’s recently announced plan to phase out the use of AMD chips from government PCs and servers. AMD gets about 15% of its revenue from mainland China, so the news impacted AMD stock.\n\nBut I’m still confident. AMD is too strong a growth play to ignore here. The stock is up 70% in the last year and gets a “B” grade for growth and an overall “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is another name that’s been on my radar screen in recent months. The company made its mark by using AI to provide real-time analysis and suggestions to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.\n\nBut in recent quarters, Palantir is growing the business on the commercial side – and that’s where the real growth will be. Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million. By contrast, Palantir’s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%.\n\nPalantir also has a software deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will make some of its products, including AI software, deployable on Oracle’s platform.\n\nTheStreet Pro analyst Bruce Kamich has a $48 price target on PLTR stock, which would be a 125% increase from today’s prices. I think it’s certainly achievable. PLTR stock is up 142% in the last 12 months and gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the companies that first brought generative AI into the public arena. It was a gamechanger when OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in late 2022, and Microsoft, with a 49% stake in the company, had a lot to do with that development. Microsoft already uses OpenAI in many of its products.\n\nBut Microsoft isn’t finished yet – not by a long shot. It’s building a new AI hub in London that is expected to  “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models.”\n\nAnd here’s something else to consider: Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says that generative AI is giving Microsoft an “iPhone moment.” Think about that for a moment. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changed the world when it unveiled the iPhone which was the first mass-marketed smartphone. And it changed the trajectory of Apple stock for decades.\n\nIf generative AI is truly Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” the Microsoft could be seeing a long period of sustained growth.\n\nMSFT stock is up 43% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another company that is using AI to its advantage. The company utilizes AI for voice recognition products, such as one geared toward vehicle owners that lets them access their owners’ manual and ask questions about vehicle features.\n\nEmployee Assist is another great SoundHound product that provides audio instructions to an employee who makes a verbal request about job functions.\n\nThe stock took off in a big way in mid-February when Nvidia disclosed an ownership position in the company. And even though the stock has pulled back in recent weeks to less than $5 per share, the partnership with Nvidia and SoundHound is too appealing for me to ignore.\n\nSoundHound is also planning to sell as much as $150 million in new shares – an announcement that contributed to the stock’s recent slide, but I see as a sign that the company is one of the most compelling growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nSOUN stock remains up 80% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most important companies in the world. It more than dominates the internet search market. In fact, it has a near monopoly, with a 95% market share for its Google search engine. That gives Alphabet an unmatched profit center for its advertising business.\n\nAnd remember, Alphabet is a lot more than just Google. The company operates YouTube, Waze, Nest, Fitbit and more.\n\nBut one place where Alphabet has not made waves is with AI – at least, until very recently. GOOG stock jumped higher this month on a flurry of AI developments that are long overdue for a company as revolutionary as Alphabet. It’s creating in-house designed data center CPUs, launching a new AI-powered text-to-video application, and its introducing AI-powered add-ons to its subscription-based software products.\n\nAlphabet will report quarterly earnings in late April. And even if there are short-term headwinds, I’m confident in GOOG stock as a long-term growth play.\n\nGOOG is up 48% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew companies have the reach as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger and WhatsApp counts 3.98 billion people as monthly active users.\n\nThat enormous audience makes Meta an extremely attractive advertising platform, which is why Meta is working on harnessing the power of AI and machine learning to optimize its advertising offerings. Meta also unveiled its latest in-house artificial intelligence accelerator chip.\n\nAnalysts are reiterating “buy” or equivalent to “buy” ratings on shares and raising their quarterly earnings forecasts for META stock, which will issue its next quarterly earnings report on April 24.\n\nIf Meta beats those expectations, it could be an extremely good day for shareholders, which makes it one of the best growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nMETA stock is up 129% in the last year and 41% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an “A” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR and MSFT.

        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability in a crazed market, jump into safer blue-chip stocks.\n\nWhile they’re not all the most exciting stocks on the market, they have proven themselves to be ultra-reliable in any economic environment. They all have proven business models, strong track records, sales, reputations and oftentimes, dividends to boot. That’s because most offer products and services that millions of us use every day.\n\nEven better, after a recent pullback in the broader markets, some of the top blue-chip stocks are on sale. Look at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After testing a high of $17.59, it pulled back to $16.33, where it caught support and is just starting to pivot higher. Plus, it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, which tells us it’s overdue to bounce. And while you wait for the AT&T stock to recover, you can collect its yield of 6.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven more top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold today.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) gapped from about $100 to a low of $88.80. However, it’s starting to pivot higher, and could soon refill that gap at around $100. Helping, Bank of America analysts just upgraded the NKE stock to a buy rating with a price target of $113. The firm argues NKE has a newer line up of footwear and apparel products. Plus, the upcoming Olympics should have a positive impact on the stock, too.\n\nJPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $164. The firm pointed to Nike’s improvement in China. In addition, Morgan Stanley says retailers are seeing improving sequential demand trends for athletic apparel.\n\nBetter, earnings negativity has been priced into the stock. Investors weren’t too enthused when the company said growth was near zero, or that management expected for revenue to pull back in the first half of fiscal 2025, which starts in June. But again, that appears to be priced in.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere’s also “The Monthly Dividend Company,” Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nWith a yield of 5.93%, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is also a buy on weakness. In fact, after slipping from $54.39 to $50.65, it’s now starting to pivot higher again. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its monthly dividend. Its latest one for 25.7 cents is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. This is the company’s 646th consecutive monthly dividend with many more on the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income has been around for more than 50 years now. It has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nSome of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few. It’s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) Fidelity sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund, such as the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF “focuses on companies we believe have above-average earnings growth potential with sustainable business models, for which the market has mispriced the rate and/or durability of growth,” as noted by Fidelity.\n\nTop holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to name a few.\n\nEven more impressive, since bottoming out at around $27 in late October, the ETF hit a high of about $39. It just recently pulled back with the broader market to $36.84. Now oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, that weakness is an opportunity. From its current price of $36.84, I’d like to see the ETF challenge $40 a share initially.\n\nWhat’s nice about an ETF like this one is we can diversify with top blue-chip stocks. All for less than $37 a share at the moment.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG) vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot blue-chip ETF to consider is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VIG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06%, the VIG ETF currently yields 1.76%. its last payout of 76.92 cents was paid on March 27. The next one should be out by June. It also holds 340 stocks, including Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). All in its effort to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $150, the VIG ETF ran to a high of $183.02. Since then, it has dipped to $173.63, where it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price, I’d like to see it initially retest $182.07 and head to $200 near term.\n\nWhat’s nice about this ETF is we can gain exposure to 340 of the world’s top stocks. All for less than $175 a share at the moment. Plus, we can collect its yield as it appreciates.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which we’re all familiar with.\n\nWith a yield of 2.56%, the consumer goods company is also a buy on recent weakness. After pulling back from about $160, it’s now technically oversold at $157.29. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R and is just starting to pivot higher. Initially, I’d like to see the PG stock retest its prior high and push to at least $170 near term.\n\nIt also just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.0065, a 7% jump from its prior dividend of 94.07 cents. It’s payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 19.\n\nHelping, Barclays just reiterated a buy rating on the PG stock with a price target of $168. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also raised their price target to $172 with a buy rating. The firm says “year-to-date consumption trends for Procter remain solid in tracked channels. The firm sees little risk to near-term earnings numbers given the company’s ongoing productivity momentum and relative cost favorability,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) An angled side view of a row of parked cars. automotive stock picks\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), it traded at $135 on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “Use the weakness as an opportunity. While we wait for the eventual recovery here, we can collect its 2.76% yield. We can profit from capital appreciation, and get paid to wait.” Just a few months later, GPC is now up to $160.23 and could see higher highs.\n\nNow yielding 2.5%, the stock rocketed 11.2% higher on Thursday after raising its fiscal year 2024 profit guidance. For the year, it expected to post EPS of $8.95 to $9.15. Now it expects to post EPS of $9.05 to $.9.20, which boosted investor confidence.\n\nEven better, its dividend – which has been increased consistently for 67 years – is safe. In the first three months of 2024, the company said it “used $175 million in cash for financing activities, including $133 million for quarterly dividends paid to shareholders and $38 million for stock repurchases. Free cash flow was $203 million.”\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks good on weakness, too.\n\nAfter dropping to $58.18 from $61, it’s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. But it is starting to bounce back fast. From its last traded price of $58.91, I’d like to see it retest $61. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its yield of about 3.3%. Its latest dividend of 48.5 cents was recently paid out on April 1. Annualized, it’s $1.94 and is the company’s 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nPlus, “The company returned $8 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2023, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to shareowners since Jan. 1, 2010, to $84.7 billion,” as noted in a recent press release. Helping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on KO to $68 with an overweight rating. All as the company continues to grow its revenue, as the global soft drink market continues to explode.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "It's Time to Ditch These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks and Replace Them With 2 Bona Fide Outperformers",
        "content": "Within the past couple of weeks, all three major stock indexes powered their way to fresh record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that are widely credited with lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to new heights.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, as the name implies, are seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. These seven components are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from crushing the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing-10-year period, the Magnificent Seven have undeniable competitive advantages. Examples include:\n\nNvidia controlling upwards of 90% of all graphics processing units deployed in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated enterprise data centers. Amazon being the leader in U.S. e-commerce retail market share and global cloud infrastructure service spend (via Amazon Web Services). Alphabet's Google accounting for an estimated 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, per GlobalStats.\n\nBut not all of the Magnificent Seven components are ultimately \"magnificent.\" To be brutally honest, some have been nothing short of operating duds over the past year. What follows are two Magnificent Seven stocks that should be sent to the chopping block, as well as the two phenomenal businesses that can logically replace them.\n\nIt's time to ditch this Magnificent Seven component: Tesla\n\nAs I stated plainly in late February, the Tesla growth story is officially dead. While the company has amassed a healthy cash pile to navigate a turbulent market for electric vehicles (EVs), and it's driven its first-mover advantages to four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, Tesla is a shell of what it was once advertised to be.\n\nTo begin with, the company has been aggressively reducing the sales price of Model's 3, S, X, and Y since the start of 2023. Between Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023, Tesla's operating margin was more-than-halved to 8.2%. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that EV demand dictates his company's pricing strategy. Yet even with aggressive price cuts, inventory levels have been stubbornly climbing.\n\nAnother issue with Tesla is that its efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many EV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has stalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-digits. Tesla's sales and profitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs -- and that's a segment that's under serious pressure right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've highlighted in the past, Tesla also generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources that include interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. This makes the company's premium valuation all the more egregious.\n\nTesla is an auto company losing its first-mover advantages that, in my view, has no business being viewed as a Magnificent Seven component. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt's also time to put this Magnificent Seven constituent out to pasture: Apple\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven stock that should be given the proverbial heave-ho is tech titan Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple's iPhone still dominates in the U.S., and the company's subscription-powered Services segment has been its most-consistent performer for years. Further, the $651 billion in share repurchases Apple has undertaken since the start of 2013 is tops among all public companies. A steady diet of buybacks has provided a boost to Apple's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe concern with Apple is that its growth engine has completely stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended in late September), sales declined in all of Apple's physical product segments. Through the first three months of fiscal 2024, iPad and Wearables generated double-digit percentage sales declines from the prior-year period.\n\nTo make matters worse, preliminary research data released from IDC last week shows that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by 9.6% to 50.1 million units from the previous year. iPhone is the company's top revenue driver.\n\nWhen Apple was valued at 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings, no one batted an eye if the company endured a growth hiccup. But at 27 times forecast EPS for the current fiscal year, a second consecutive year of zero or negative growth is too much of an eyesore to sweep under the rug.\n\nApple's best growth days may well be in the rearview mirror -- and for that reason, it no longer belongs in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe first outperformer that deserves its spot among the Magnificent Seven: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIf Tesla and Apple are shown the door, the first no-brainer company that should be viewed as a true Magnificent Seven component is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nWhile it's true that Berkshire isn't an innovator in the same capacity as either Tesla or Apple, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team have led Berkshire to virtually unmatched annualized returns dating back more than a half-century. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500.\n\nThree catalysts continue to make Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders richer over time. First off, Buffett and his team have a lengthy track record of generating big-time returns in the stock market. Berkshire's $361 billion investment portfolio contains 45 stocks and two index funds, with a heavy concentration in just four stocks (one of which happens to be Apple).\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly five dozen businesses, which have helped grow its operating revenue and income. Some of Berkshire's fully owned subsidiaries include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF. A portfolio weighted heavily to cyclical businesses gets to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe third reason Berkshire's stock keeps climbing is because Warren Buffett has given the green light to more than $74 billion worth of share buybacks since July 2018. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire's EPS and making its stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused long-term investors.\n\nA second outperformer that's proven it's magnificent: Visa\n\nThe other outstanding company that makes for a logical replacement for Tesla or Apple in the Magnificent Seven is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, you could certainly argue that Tesla and Apple are more innovative than Visa. But few companies have delivered for their shareholders on a more consistent basis than Visa has since its initial public offering in March 2008.\n\nIn the U.S., no payment processor accounts for a higher share of credit card network purchase volume than Visa. It was also the only payment facilitator in the U.S. that gained substantial share following the Great Recession. Since economic expansions last substantially longer than recessions, Visa benefits from the disproportionate long-term growth in spending from consumers and businesses.\n\nIt also has a lengthy growth runway beyond domestic borders. Emerging market regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia remain underbanked. Visa has the ability to organically expand its infrastructure into these markets, as well as quickly reach new regions by making acquisitions, just as it did in 2016 when it acquired Visa Europe.\n\nBest of all, Visa's management team has steered clear of becoming a lender. This strategic move ensures that it won't have to set aside capital during inevitable recessions to deal with credit delinquencies and loan losses. This is a competitive edge that's helped Visa maintain a juicy profit margin north of 50%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Recently More Than Doubled His Holdings of These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giants.",
        "content": "Stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" have attracted investors' attention in recent times -- and that includes the attention of some of the world's most successful investors. The perfect example is billionaire Ken Griffin, who, through his Citadel hedge fund, holds shares of all of these top technology stocks.\n\nThere's reason to pay close attention to the stocks Griffin is buying because he clearly has made many winning bets -- so you could win by following some of his moves. As the best-performing hedge fund ever, Citadel has generated about $74 billion in gains over time for investors. And last year, Citadel brought in more than $8 billion, prompting LCH Investments to name the money manager among 2023's top performers.\n\nMost recently, Griffin has more than doubled his holdings of two Magnificent Seven stocks, players that both are investing heavily in AI and could emerge as winners in an eventual AI revolution. Let's check out these Griffin buys that could boost your portfolio too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, Griffin's Citadel increased its position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) by 127%, adding more than 1 million shares. Now you may not immediately think of AI when you think of Meta. After all, the company owns Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, making it a social media giant. And thanks to this leadership, it generates the lion's share of its revenue by selling advertising across these platforms.\n\nBut AI is progressively becoming more and more a part of Meta's business, with the company aiming to include the technology in all of its products and services. For now, you can get a taste of this thanks to Meta's launch of the Meta AI conversational assistant in beta version across apps in certain geographies. By making AI an integral part of the social media experience, Meta may keep users on its apps longer -- and this could encourage advertisers to keep spending on these platforms to reach their target audiences.\n\nMeta has made AI its investment focus this year and plans to bring on 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) of compute by the end of the year. The company also aims to become a leader in AI, open sourcing its large language model (LLM) Llama so that Meta's platform may one day be the industry standard.\n\nAll of this means now is a great time to follow Griffin into Meta, a company with a solid earnings track record and revenue source -- and potential to win in the AI market over time.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nCitadel lifted its position in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock by 227% in the fourth quarter, buying more than 4 million shares. The hedge fund has thousands of holdings, but Amazon is its fourth-biggest position, so it's fair to say this player is one of Citadel's favorites. And for good reason. Amazon could benefit from AI in two ways and both might supercharge earnings over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, Amazon itself is using AI to become more efficient and lower its cost to serve. For example, in e-commerce AI helps Amazon determine the fastest delivery routes for package delivery -- this reduces travel time and therefore cost. Amazon also is using AI to help customers find just the right items, and this is likely to keep them coming back.\n\nSecond, Amazon's cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- sells AI chips and related products and services to customers. And here, Amazon could win big. AWS is the world's biggest cloud company, meaning it has access to an enormous client base. And it's likely that these AWS clients will stick with the cloud provider for AI projects rather than going elsewhere.\n\nAWS is going all in on AI, offering not only chips but also a fully managed service that gives customers access to popular LLMs that they can customize for their own purposes. This means AWS may serve a broad range of AI customers.\n\nAll of this should help Amazon -- already a leader in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud -- benefit from the explosive growth area of AI. And that's why right now is the perfect time to get in on this Ken Griffin stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Fed's favorite inflation gauge and Big Tech earnings greet a slumping stock market: What to know this week",
        "content": "The market rally is at its most fragile point in months.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended Friday below 5,000, its first close below that mark since late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 5% on the week while the Dow held flat.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of first quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the March reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results headlined by Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge\n\nSeveral months of bumpy inflation readings have forced investors to scale back their projections for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year.\n\nOn Friday, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said \"progress on inflation has stalled\" when noting that it \"makes sense\" for the central bank to wait for more clarity on inflation's path.\n\nThis makes Friday's PCE reading all the more critical.\n\nEconomists expect \"core\" PCE clocked in at 2.7% in March from the previous year, down from February's 2.8% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.3%, in line with last month's change.\n\n\"Should core PCE inflation come in around 0.25% [month-over-month] for March and April, the year-on-year reading will slow from 2.8% to 2.6%, giving the Fed cover to begin 'gradually' adjusting policy rates lower starting in June or July,\" Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a note to clients on April 17.\n\nGrowth update\n\nPart of the reason investors had largely taken the repricing of Fed interest rate cuts in stride has been an increasingly positive economic backdrop. Throughout the first quarter, economists have been raising their projections for economic growth. Thursday will bring the first look at whether the US economy grew as fast as forecast in the first three months of this year.\n\nEconomists expect that the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in the first quarter, lower than the 3.4% seen in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\"Incoming data continue to point to ongoing economic resilience in an environment of higher rates,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"The consumer continues to remain strong. The economy has cooled modestly since the outsized 4.9% growth rate seen in 3Q, but what cooling there is has been gradual.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings aren't impressing\n\nGiven the significant run-up in share price that some of the market rally's darlings have experienced this year, even better-than-expected earnings aren't moving the needle for stocks.\n\n\"The broader market is having digestion problems in and around this earnings season,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis has broadly been seen across stock reactions the day following the release of quarterly results for the 65 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far this season. Stocks that top Wall Street's estimates have risen 0.8% in the next trading session, slightly lower than the 0.9% average seen over the last few years, per Emanuel's research.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that disappoint on both metrics are taking a bigger hit than normal, with the average stock falling 5.8% in the next trading action, compared to the usual 3.1% decline seen over the past five years.\n\n\"Given these extended valuations [in the S&P 500], even good news may not be good news, particularly in these names that have run as far as they have,\" Emanuel said.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nWith earnings reports not satisfying investors, the baton will be passed to one of the strongest parts of the market over the past year: Big Tech.\n\nDespite a sell-off across tech last week after disappointing results from chipmakers and Netflix (NFLX), earnings growth expectations are still sky-high for Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which are all expected to report in the week ahead.\n\nFactSet noted on Friday that these companies, along with Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN), are expected to have grown earnings by 64.3% in the first quarter. The other 495 companies are projected to see earnings decline by 6%.\n\nSurging yields\n\nOutside of earnings, investors will closely watch the economic data this week to see how it might shift movements in rising bond yields, which are becoming a pain point for investors again.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield shot up to 5% on Tuesday for the first time since the most recent stock market bottom in October 2023. The move came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it's taking \"longer than expected\" for inflation to fall to its 2% target.\n\nAnd Evercore ISI's Emanuel believes this will be a key pain point for stocks, just as it was during a sell-off in the market last fall.\n\n\"The reason it might be more of the concern at this point is because of that implicit promise that markets have traded on of three [Fed rate] cuts dialed back,\" Emanuel said. \"And if you look at it going back to March, I think it's a lot more than a confidence the market rolled over from the highs literally precisely the moment the market started pricing in fewer than those three promised cuts.\"\n\nEmanuel cautioned that it might be time to get defensive in the market because of this. He recommended exposure to sectors such as Health Care (XLV) and Consumer Staples (XLP) while also noting the roughly 5% that can be earned by holding cash in a money market account is still a viable portion of a portfolio.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, March (+0.05 prior)\n\nEarnings: Albertsons (ACI), Bank of Hawaii (BOH), Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE), SAP (SAP), Truist (TFC), Verizon (VZ), Zions Bancorporation (ZION)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, April, preliminary (52.0 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 52.1 previously); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, April (-11 prior); New home sales, March (670,000 expected, 662,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, March (1.2% expected, -0.3% previously)\n\nEarnings:  Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), General Electric (GE), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Mattel (MAT), PepsiCo (PEP), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Spotify (SPOT), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Tesla (TSLA), UPS (UPS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Visa (V)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending April 19 (+3.3% prior); Durable Goods Orders, March preliminary (+2.5% expected, +1.3% prior)\n\nEarnings: Meta Platforms (META), AT&T (T), Boeing (BA), Chipotle (CMG), Ford (F), Humana (HUM), ADP (ADP), eBay (EBAY), General Dynamics (GD), Hilton (HLT), IBM (IBM), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), ServiceNow (NOW), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: First quarter GDP, first estimate (+2.5% annualized rate expected, +3.4% previously); First quarter personal consumption, first estimate (+2.6% expected, 3.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended, April 20 (215,000 expected, 212,000 previously); Pending home sales, month-over-month, March (+1.0% expected, +1.6% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), American Airlines (AAL), AstraZeneca (AZN), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), Mobileye (MBLY), Roku (ROKU), Snap (SNAP), Royal Caribbean (RCL), Southwest (LUV), T-Mobile (TMUS)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal income, month-over-month, March (+0.5% expected, +0.3% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, March (+0.6% expected, +0.8% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, March (+2.6% expected, +2.5% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, March (+2.7% expected; +2.8% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, April, final reading (77.9 expected, 77.9 previously)\n\nEarnings: Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Charter Communications (CHTR), Colgate (CL)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "My Top 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks has been a powerhouse in the market since the start of 2023, with all of them beating the S&P 500. It includes:\n\nMicrosoft  Apple Nvidia Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla\n\nThis collection has had a strong run, but not every one of them is a strong buy right now, in my opinion. Nearly every one of these companies has artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations, but my reason for buying three of the seven stocks is centered around a much older practice: Advertising.\n\nAdvertising is a massive industry\n\nIf advertising is my reason to buy some of these stocks, then Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are the ones I'm talking about. This trio generates a massive amount of revenue each quarter from advertising.\n\nCompany Q4 Advertising Revenue Alphabet  $65.5 Billion Meta Platforms  $38.7 Billion Amazon $14.7 Billion\n\nData sources: Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta are leaders in this category, some may be surprised that Amazon is also heavily involved in the ad marketplace. In fact, advertising services were Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter, increasing 27% year over year.\n\nMeta's ad division also put up solid growth figures in Q4, with its ad revenue rising 24% year over year. Alphabet was the laggard of the trio, but this also makes sense due to its sheer size. It delivered an 11% growth rate in Q4.\n\nSo why are these growth rates a big deal? Well, if you rewind the clock to this time last year, these rates weren't nearly as impressive (besides Amazon). The ad market struggled in early 2023 due to fears of a recession. When businesses are concerned about a potential economic downfall, they save on whatever expenses they can. One of the easiest places to trim is ad budgets, which negatively affects businesses like Meta and Alphabet, which are highly concentrated in this industry.\n\nHowever, the fear of imminent recession has subsided, so businesses are happy to begin increasing their ad budgets. This is why ad-heavy companies like Meta and Alphabet have seen success recently.\n\nAmazon is a different story, as their ad revenue growth never dipped like Alphabet's or Meta's. This is likely due to the relatively young age of Amazon's ad business and that it's still working on building out its capabilities. When this segment matures, it will likely display the cyclical trends that the other two do, but it's in full growth mode right now.\n\nWith the ad market improving each quarter, all three companies stand to benefit, making them excellent buys.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks are still attractive buys\n\nIn addition to a recovering ad market, these three are some of the most attractively priced Magnificent Seven stocks. My valuation metric of choice for Alphabet and Meta is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the trailing 12 months used in the more common trailing P/E ratio still includes some quarters where the ad business was down. If you use this metric, it's clear these two are fairly priced. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWe can use Amazon's forward P/E (it's at 44), but that isn't fair to the business as portions of the company (like its international commerce division) aren't profitable and aren't expected to become fully profitable for some time. As a result, I'll use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to value Amazon. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nFrom this perspective, Amazon still has a way to go before being valued at the same levels as 2018 through 2021. So, investors can confidently buy the stock, knowing that it still isn't back to historical valuation norms.\n\nAdvertising is a great business to be in right now, which makes this trio a fantastic pick in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "content": "One of the more useful functions of Meta Platforms's (NASDAQ: META) core Facebook site is its messaging service. So it wasn't surprising that the company's share price fell on news that its messaging will no longer be available as a stand-alone app in a top mobile marketplace in China. Meta's stock closed Friday more than 4% down in price, which was a far steeper tumble than the 0.9% drop of the S&P 500 index.\n\nFacebook Messenger removed from App Store in China\n\nBefore market open, The Wall Street Journal reported that a clutch of popular messaging apps were removed from Apple's App Store that day. This included Facebook Messenger, plus Telegram and Signal. The iPhone maker said this was done by request, with rather vague \"national security concerns\" cited as the reason.\n\nThe Journal quoted an unnamed Apple spokesperson as saying that \"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree.\"\n\nFacebook Messenger, Telegram, and Signal are inaccessible behind the so-called Great Firewall erected by the Chinese government. However, it is common for people in the country to find ways around such restrictions, and messaging apps are popular. The country's authorities have historically been suspicious of these apps, as they consider them to be conduits of material unfavorable or even threatening to the government.\n\nThere is always a way\n\nThe removal of Facebook Messenger doesn't necessarily mean the removal of Facebook from Chinese society. As they always do, users in the massive Asian country will find a way to connect with social media, and if they have Facebook accounts, they'll probably continue to use them in some fashion -- even without Messenger. I don't think the sudden App Store ban is much of a threat to Meta's business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Many in the market are looking to this week's quarterly results from the four members of ‘the Magnificent 7’ to help reverse the stock market’s ongoing weakness.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be tied to the timing of Fed easing as a result of the evolving inflation picture rather than any deterioration in the overall earnings picture. If anything, the overall earnings picture has actually been improving ever so slightly in recent weeks, as we have been noting in our earnings commentary.\n\nThe hope appears to be that robust results from the Mag 7 companies reporting this week – Tesla TSLA on Tuesday, April 23rd, Meta Platforms META on Wednesday, April 24th, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Thursday, April 25th – will help restore confidence in the market’s fundamental underpinnings and offset some of the Fed-centric worries.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs the above chart shows, Meta is in a league of its own, while Microsoft and Alphabet are roughly tracking each other.\n\nThis pecking order, with Meta at the top and Tesla at the bottom, remains unchanged when we begin tracking from October 27, 2023, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis divergence in performance reflects each stock’s earnings outlook, with Meta enjoying the best and Tesla the worst.\n\nThe current Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS for Meta of $4.32 has increased +20% since late January 2024. On the other hand, Tesla’s Q1 EPS estimate of $0.46 has been cut by more than -41% over the same period.\n\nTesla’s woes are well known, ranging from a distracted leader to fundamental supply-demand forces for its core product. Meta is benefiting from an improving digital ad market and effective cost controls.\n\nQ1 estimates for Microsoft and Alphabet have barely moved higher, with both largely seen as leading the AI effort. It is unlikely that we will see any tangible developments from either of these two companies on their respective AI strategies, but we will nevertheless get more clarity about the coming periods.\n\nThe below chart illustrates current consensus expectations for the ‘Mag 7’ stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they achieved in the preceding period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +33% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.7% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group’s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group jumped back into the ‘regular/normal’ growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.4% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs was the case with the ‘Mag 7’, the Tech sector as a whole dealt with the pulled-forward revenues during 2021 but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode,  as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThis week, we enter the heart of the Q1 earnings season, with more than 500 companies reporting results, including 155 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-cap Tech players, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\n\nThrough Friday, April 19th, we have seen Q1 results from 71 S&P 500 index members. Total Q1 earnings for these 71 index members are up +9.4% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 77.5% beating EPS estimates and 63.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. shares fell the most in nine months Friday, taking the shine off stellar first-quarter financial results following management’s decision to stop reporting quarterly subscriber data.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Israel Reported to Have Launched Retaliatory Strike on Iran Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding\n\nThis metric has long been the primary way Wall Street evaluated the company’s performance, but executives at Netflix, which now has almost 270 million subscribers, have tried to shift the focus to measures like sales and profit. Other tech giants like Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have taken similar steps in recent years.\n\nIn the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports.\n\nOn Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers.\n\n“Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors.\n\nNetflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere.\n\nIn 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.\n\nLast quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\n\nBeginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.”\n\nThe good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus.\n\nIn 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.\n\nNetflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well.\n\nIn explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant.\n\n“All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nAmid rising inflation and economic uncertainty, millions of young Americans are starting to invest in different asset classes to secure their future and achieve their financial goals. As of the end of 2022, a whopping 58% of US households reported owning stocks, according to the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances. Increasing household wealth and the rise of zero-commission apps like Robinhood is partially responsible for this boom in retail investing.\n\nHas there been any change in retail investing trends ever since the Fed started raising interest rates? Money-market funds, bonds, treasuries and fixed income in general became much more tempting for investors who wanted to avoid volatility that comes with stock investing. In August last year, The Wall Street Journal, citing data from Refinitiv Lipper, said in a report that in matter of just five weeks, investors pulled $11.6 billion from stock funds on a net basis, while money-market funds saw an inflow of $91.1 billion.\n\nYoung Americans are Investing in Stocks and Pre-IPO Growth Companies\n\nAnalysts also note that young Americans are increasingly getting bored of the same-old names when it comes to stocks and want to invest in companies that will grow big in the future. They want to invest in the Apples, Microsofts and Nvidias of the future. And there are interesting options available for such investors. The Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) fund, which recently went public, lets you invest in high-growth companies that aren’t publicly traded. Some top names in the fund's portfolio are OpenAI, SpaceX, commercial space station company Axiom Space, Discord, Klarna, among many others. Other platforms allowing investors to invest in high-growth companies are also seeing a huge influx of young investors. For example, an April 16 Bloomberg report talked about Hiive, a platform that allows you to invest in pre-IPO, VC-backed companies. The report quoted Hiive's CEO Sim Desai, who said that the number of daily accepted bids has averaged 16 in the past 30 days, up from just three bids a year ago.\n\nRobinhood's Popularity is Increasing\n\nRobinhood is one of the popular platforms for retail investors, with over 10 million monthly active users. It's no longer an investing app where young investors band together to wage wars against short-selling hedge funds. Instead the company is in an expansion mode with new products for crypto investors as well as credit and gold cards. Last month, Bernstein started covering Robinhood stock with an Outperform rating, saying a \"monster\" crypto cycle over the next two years could boost the stock as more and more retail investors turn to the app to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024\n\nPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash\n\nTeenagers Using Apps to Invest\n\nBeyond millennial Redditors, there's another class of retail investors entering the market: teenagers. Investing-related TikTok videos, personal finance blogs, Instagram influencers and an overall rise in financial awareness is causing teenagers in America to invest. In 2022, there were about 200,000 custodial accounts for teens at Schwab, compared to just 120,000 in 2019. That figure jumped to 300,000 in 2023.\n\nDon’t Miss: Best Long-Term Investments for Your Child\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used publicly available data from Robinhood that shows the most popular stocks on the investing app. We also did some manual research to see which stocks are trending on the app these days with positive sentiment. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with these stocks where available. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).  Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) is a new arrival in the list of popular stocks on Robinhood. The stock plummeted after Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) revealed plans to sell more shares in the coming months. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) filed to register 146.11 million shares of common stock for holders, 21.49 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, and 4.06 million warrants to purchase common stock. DJT is rebounding after these dips and the stock is up a whopping 23% over the past five days.\n\n10. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) remains one of the favorites of retail investors who scored huge wins against hedge funds shorting the stock back in the pandemic days. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares have lost about 39% so far this year. Short sellers are targeting the stock again, with GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) short interest coming in at 24% as of April 16. Are retail investors banding together yet again to beat these short sellers? Only time will tell. But for now, the stock is declining after disappointing Q4 results which saw GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) hardware sales tanking.\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:40\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 hedge funds had stakes in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The most significant stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which had a $721 million stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F).\n\nIn addition to Ford, retail investors are also buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),   Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n8. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 82\n\nRanking eighth in our list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024 is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has lost about 35% in value year to date. Amid growth challenges and woes in China, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has decided to cut 10% of its global workforce.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 82 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The most significant stake in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is owned by Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which had a $1 billion stake in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”\n\n7. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024. The stock has gained about 24% so far this year. Most of these gains came after Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) won its proxy fight against Nelson Peltz who had launched an activist campaign to get board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). Like DIS, hedge funds and retail investors also like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),   Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is also one of the most popular stocks among the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Our data shows that 89 hedge funds had stakes in Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) as of the end of 2023.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”\n\n6. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are struggling this year as the company continues to face growth challenges amid competition. In a latest blow, data shows that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lost its market leader status in the smartphone industry to Samsung. Data from IDC shows that iPhone shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter of 2024. Samsung’s market share jumped to 20.8% as of the end of the first quarter, while Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to 17.3%. IDC said rising competition in China from companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, among others, is part of the reason why Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Dividend Stocks with Over 9% Yield According to Analysts 10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) to Report Q1 Earnings: What to Expect",
        "content": "Meta Platforms META is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24.\r\n\r\nThe company expects total revenues between $34.5 billion and $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $36.22 billion, indicating an increase of 26.46% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.32 per share, which has increased 1.17% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 63.64% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMeta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.71%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nMeta’s first-quarter top line is expected to have benefited from Facebook’s expanding user base (more than 3.065 billion monthly active users) and growing adoption of reels. Increased engagement for Meta’s its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nEffective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nReels have been a major growth driver for Instagram. Meta remains focused on growing Reels as part of its overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram.\r\n\r\nMeta has been leveraging gen AI to boost user experience across its apps. AI stickers, AI-based editing tools, advanced conversational assistant — Meta AI — and others to improve user engagement.\r\n\r\nIt has been experimenting with incorporating gen AI to help creators create different captions and thumbnails.\r\n\r\nMeta has also started to roll out Reels in Meta AI chats. It is also exploring ways to make Facebook more attractive and fun-filled for users leveraging Meta AI.\r\n\r\nHigher engagement levels are helping to steady its user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the first quarter is pegged at 926 million, indicating 6.07% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for the Rest of World is expected to have increased 5% to 690 million DAUs.\r\n\r\nRegarding Monthly Active Users (MAUs), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific is pegged at 1.376 billion, suggesting 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for the Rest of World’s MAUs is expected to have risen 4% to 1.025 billion MAUs.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta’s worldwide DAU is pegged at 2.13 billion, indicating 4.57% growth year over year. The consensus estimate for worldwide MAU is pegged at 3.087 billion, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year increase.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Meta’s top line is expected to reflect the negative impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and persistent inflation that is anticipated to have kept ad spending budgets under pressure. This is likely to have weighed on ad revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Meta’s ad revenues represented 96.5% of total revenues, which increased 23.8% year over year to $38.71 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 ad revenues is pegged at $35.59 billion, indicating 26.6% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "title": "What Analyst Projections for Key Metrics Reveal About Meta Platforms (META) Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "The upcoming report from Meta Platforms (META) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $4.32 per share, indicating an increase of 63.6% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $36.25 billion, representing an increase of 26.6% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Meta Platforms metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Reality Labs' will likely reach $525.62 million. The estimate points to a change of +55.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Family of Apps (FoA)' should come in at $35.89 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26.8%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Advertising' will reach $35.59 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26.7%.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Other' will reach $277.35 million. The estimate suggests a change of +35.3% year over year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Advertising Revenue- US & Canada' to come in at $16.13 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +26.9% year over year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Advertising Revenue- Asia-Pacific' will reach $7.30 billion. The estimate points to a change of +23.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Advertising Revenue- Rest of the World' stands at $4.14 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +28.4%.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Advertising Revenue- Europe' at $8.19 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +30.6% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Monthly active users (MAUs) - Worldwide' reaching 3,086.69 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 2,989 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Worldwide' should arrive at 2,129.76 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 2,037 million.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Europe' to reach 310.51 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 307 million.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Rest of World' of 689.60 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 657 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have experienced a change of -1.2% in the past month compared to the -2.6% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this social media company have returned -1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share, indicating a change of +63.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.7%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.25 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +26.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $159.44 billion and $179.83 billion estimates indicate +18.2% and +12.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Got $5,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term.",
        "content": "The tech industry has dominated stock-market gains for quite some time now, and it's been even more noticeable with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of the high-growth opportunities many tech companies provide, it makes sense why many growth-seeking investors go the tech route.\n\nRegardless of the opportunities that tech stocks offer, it's still important that investors keep a long-term mindset and not approach them expecting to get rich quickly.\n\nFor investors with $5,000 available to invest, the following three options are good long-term choices, and you can divide your money evenly among them. They each operate in different tech industries but are market leaders in their own right.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nFrom an online bookstore to a tech conglomerate, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is arguably the prime example of growth stocks in the tech industry. A $1,000 investment in Amazon at its May 1997 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth over $1.8 million today.\n\nAmazon rose to dominance because of its e-commerce business but has since become the leading cloud service provider with its platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's also made a mark in the entertainment industry with its Prime Video.\n\nE-commerce accounts for most of Amazon's revenue, but AWS is responsible for much of the company's profits. Both factors explain why the company is poised to be a force for the long haul. Regarding e-commerce, it's beginning to leverage its logistics network, which cost the company billions to develop, to generate new income streams with its Supply Chain by Amazon.\n\nSupply Chain by Amazon is a fully automated set of supply chain services that allow sellers to use the company's intricate logistics, warehousing, distribution, fulfillment capabilities, and transportation (including international). Being able to grow from its own e-commerce business to serve the broader e-commerce market will only strengthen Amazon's stronghold on the industry.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is one of the premier cybersecurity companies in the world and seems to be in the right place at the right time. The need for cybersecurity is increasing as the world becomes more digital.\n\nAccording to IBM's \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023,\" the average cost of a data breach globally is $4.45 million, and 51% of organizations plan to increase their cybersecurity spending as a result. That's just data breaches, too, but plenty of other cyberattacks can threaten a company's business.\n\nIBM's report also mentions that organizations which use AI and automation to fight this problem save $1.76 million, compared to organizations that don't. This works in CrowdStrike's favor, as the company is one of the pioneers of solely using AI to fight cyberattacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no doubt CrowdStrike's platforms are effective -- the business results speak for themselves. Around 27% of its clients use seven or more of the products in its ecosystem (called \"modules\"), 43% use six or more, and 64% use five or more. This has helped the company's free cash flow skyrocket during the past few years. CRWD Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nCrowdStrike can still cover a lot more ground in the cybersecurity industry. According to the company and market intelligence firm IDC, the AI-native cybersecurity market is estimated to grow from $100 billion this year to $225 billion by 2028. Of course, CrowdStrike won't capture all of it, but it's poised to be a company that benefits largely from this expected growth.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nDespite some well-documented public relations mishaps, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been a gift to its investors over the past one-and-a-half years. The stock price is up over 450% since its November 2022 slump.\n\nThe owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger has positioned itself as a go-to platform for advertisers looking to get their products and services in front of the eyes of Meta's 3.98 billion month active users (MAUs). It's been working wonders for the company recently, too, with its financial health as good as it has ever been by many standards.\n\nMeta has always been a revenue cash cow, but recently, its net income has surged. In 2023, Meta's net income was over $39 billion, up 69% from 2022. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMeta's net income growth relative to its revenue growth shows the company is beginning to operate more efficiently and use its capital more effectively. Meta declared a dividend in February for the first time in its history.\n\nThe company's quarterly dividend is $0.50 per share, and I think it wouldn't have started paying it at this point if it didn't intend to increase it annually. Meta is far from a dividend investor's dream, but it can be a true two-for-one for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We are in the initial stage of the first-quarter 2024 earnings season, and the results are so far in line with expectations. Meanwhile, several S&P 500 behemoths are set to beat on earnings next week. A few of them currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and an earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near term.\n\nS&P 500 in Q1 at a Glance\n\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an astonishing rally in the past 15 months. The S&P 500 — popularly known as Wall Street’s broad-market index — rallied 10.2% in first-quarter 2024 after jumping 23.9% in 2023. Notably, last quarter was its strongest first-quarter performance since 2019. The benchmark recorded 22 all-time highs in the last quarter.\n\nThe rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWall Street’s bull run in the first quarter got an added boost from the Fed’s multiple rate cuts signal, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation.\n\nMeanwhile, several S&P 500 behemoths are set to beat on earnings next week. A few of them currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and an earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near term.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five S&P 500 bigwigs that are poised to beat on earnings results next week. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%.

        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its “Polen Focus Growth Strategy” first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The US stock market started 2024 optimistically. In the first quarter, the fund returned 8.29% (gross) and 8.09% (net) compared to 11.41% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 10.56% for the S&P 500 Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy featured stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops products to connect people. On April 18, 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock closed at $501.80 per share. One-month return of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was -1.53%, and its shares gained 135.71% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a market capitalization of $1.279 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Adobe, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta has been growing revenue above 20% on easy comparisons from the prior year, and its “year of efficiency” reduced expenses, which drove robust earnings growth in 2023. Much of this should continue in the first half of 2024. The data suggests that revenue growth should come down meaningfully from recent levels in the long term. As we see it, the questions now are how much and whether management maintains its expense discipline efforts, which will determine whether the company can continue to compound earnings at a 15%+ rate over time. We remain concerned with the company’s Metaverse investments, which continue to grow despite cost cuts in the core business and now exceed $20 billion per year.\"\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in third position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. At the end of the fourth quarter, Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "It may be time to give the metaverse a second chance. Many investors are understandably somewhat skeptical of which metaverse stocks to buy following their uneven debut.\n\nThe theme had a ton of excitement and traction back 2021. So much so, in fact, that Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to reflect what he felt might be the next big growth avenue in the tech landscape. So far that hasn’t played out, or at least not on the timeline that metaverse optimists may have been hoping for.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize, and play games together remains compelling. And with technology rapidly advancing, there are better and better things that tech companies can achieve within an augmented or virtual reality setting. As a catalyst for the metaverse, earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its Apple Vision Pro, which could greatly expand the marketplace and adoption of augmented and virtual reality solutions. That makes it a great time to look at these three leading metaverse stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nUnity’s biggest appeal is its interoperability. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, and augmented and virtual reality. In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity has remained independent and can offer its graphic solutions to the entire gamut of game and app developers. Of note, Unity is one of the key partners in developing apps and experiences for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity shares have underperformed much of the tech market, as the company is still experimenting with monetization and there are also questions around its advertising-driven revenue streams. However, in the longer-term, Unity has a great graphics engine. If it can solve commercialization issues, Unity should be set for significant upside with the metaverse being an intriguing piece of its broader story.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is a property technology company. Its core business model is to have clients take high-quality imagery of their properties. Matterport can use this imagery to create detailed 3-D renderings of a property and allow the owner to host virtual walk-throughs and site visits.\n\nStory continues\n\nA wedding venue, for example, could offer virtual tours to help potential customers see and experience what their venue would be like without having to go there in person first.\n\nAs technology such as the Apple Vision Pro gains adoption, it will be easier and easier for customers to take part in the digital tour and walk-throughs. Clients such as hotels, resorts, and office buildings will increasingly embrace Matterport as folks become more accustomed to digital property tours.\n\nMatterport has gotten off to a slow start as a publicly traded company. The former SPAC has seen shares lose the majority of their value; however, the firm’s revenues continue to grow. Analysts see the company generating about $176 million in sales this year, which would be up 11% from last year. And further, analysts expect the company to reach profitability on an earnings per share basis in 2026.\n\nMatterport has overcome a rocky transition from a hardware and licensing model towards recurring subscription revenue. As investors gain confidence in its business direction, and people continue to adopt and augmented reality solutions, MTTR stock should be set for a comeback.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a large Chinese technology and media conglomerate. It both operates its own business and maintains investment stakes in a vast array of companies.\n\nTencent Holdings shares have plunged in recent years due to China’s decline in consumer spending and economic slump. However, Tencent should be ripe for a rebound as it has numerous ways to profit from China’s economic recovery.\n\nAs it pertains to the metaverse, Tencent is a leading video gaming company. It has its own media operations, and it also invests in other leading video game developers. Its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the metaverse space.\n\nThat’s because Epic runs Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales, and other monetization opportunities.\n\nTencent was ahead of the curve in taking a large ownership position in Epic and other gaming properties. It should be poised to profit from the metaverse, regardless of which particular games, experiences, and brands end up attracting the most metaverse users over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U stock.

        "content": "Though artificial intelligence (AI) continues to captivate the tech world, you can’t ignore the top metaverse stocks to buy. AI essentially picked up the baton from the metaverse and is now the leading tech frontier. Nonetheless, the metaverse cannot be taken lightly as we advance into a future where virtual experiences and real life are becoming more entwined.\n\nFurthermore, industry forecasts predict the metaverse market to be worth trillions by the end of the current decade. As technology evolves, the metaverse will offer even more refined and immersive experiences, making it a key area for investors looking to tap into the next wave of technological integration and innovation. With that said, here are three of the best stocks to capitalize on the metaverse boom.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou’d be remiss if you left out Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from metaverse stocks to buy list. The company is at the forefront of the metaverse revolution, pumping billions into the project through its Reality Labs division, which focuses on VR technology and software. Though the metaverse’s trajectory has been far from ideal, its massive long-term potential makes Meta an attractive bet in the niche.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the massive success of Meta’s ‘Year of Efficiency’ and its AI initiatives, it has the impetus to continue funding its lucrative metaverse endeavors. Its commitment to the sector is unmatched, as it funnels billions into commercializing the metaverse. Hence, if the metaverse evolves into the behemoth most experts expect it to become, Meta stands to gain the most. Moreover, the metaverse is just one aspect of Meta’s incredible growth story, which has been on full display for the past couple of years.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is another leading player in the metaverse evolution, having honed its powerful graphics for almost 20 years. Not only does it cater to gaming, but its role in powering virtual and augmented reality experiences positions it as a top metaverse stock. Moreover, it continues to expand its scope, spreading its tentacles into sectors such as architecture, design and other areas, facilitating the detailed, interactive environments that define the metaverse.\n\nDespite the current challenges, including a slowdown in the gaming industry, Unity’s trajectory remains positive. The company has grown its top-line at an impressive pace over the years, with a five-year revenue growth rate of 38%. With its role in powering multiple emerging technologies, expect it to continue growing its sales by double-digit margins for the foreseeable future. Also, with a renewed focus on cost efficiency, the company is strategically positioned to leverage the growing demand for metaverse technologies, making it a compelling choice for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is one of the innovators in the metaverse sector, captivating its powerful user base with its build-it-yourself gaming platform. Its robust platform witnessed massive growth during the pandemic, and though it stumbled with tough comps post-pandemic, it’s now back where it belongs.\n\nThe company demonstrated stellar financial performance last year, with a 26% jump in sales, coupled with bookings climbing to $3.5 billion, a 23% rise year-over-year (YOY). Moreover, it continues to attract a healthy number of daily active users, which reached 68.4 million, a 22% bump from the previous year.\n\nFurthermore, the company wants to integrate AI to enhance its platform with tools like the Roblox Assistant, enabling users to generate content through natural language prompts. Additionally, it’s looking to optimize its operations through AI while aggressively expanding its advertising capabilities, partnering with PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM) to integrate video ads. Consequently, Wall-Street expects a sizeable 36% bump in its value from current prices, signaling stellar growth prospects ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Vertiv, Meta Platforms, Cadence Design Systems, Itron and Silicon Motion Technology",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 19, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Vertiv VRT, Meta Platforms META, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, Itron ITRI and Silicon Motion Technology SIMO.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Technology Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings in Q1\n\nThe technology sector witnessed growth in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong adoption of AI and machine learning amid persistent inflation that has pushed back chances of an early rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nA challenging global macroeconomic environment due to continuing conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine negatively impacted the sector’s growth trajectory.\n\nEscalating Sino-U.S. tensions has been detrimental to the sector’s prospects. U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports to China, particularly advanced AI chips, have negatively impacted chip providers. Beijing’s strategy to phase out foreign chips in critical industries like telecom is expected to hurt semiconductor giants including Intel and AMD.\n\nNevertheless, the technology sector benefits from ongoing digitalization. The rapid adoption of cloud computing, 5G, the Internet of Things, wearables, headsets supporting augmented and virtual reality technologies, drones and blockchain is expected to have aided sector participants.\n\nAI demand is escalating, and that has increased the need for data center capacity expansion. Leading cloud computing providers like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta platforms have multi-year investment plans to support greater cloud capacity.\n\nThe advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. Large Language Models that form the backbone of generative AI requires significant computational power to process massive amount of data. The growing proliferation of generative AI has boosted the demand for chips, particularly graphics processing units, benefiting semiconductor companies.\n\nPer the Semiconductor Industry Association data, semiconductor sales in February were $46.2 billion, up 16.3% year over year. In January, sales were $47.6 billion, up 15.2% year over year.\n\nMoreover, the PC segment witnessed growth in first-quarter 2024. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpcoming Earnings to Watch\n\nA chunk of technology companies are set to report their earnings results over the next couple of weeks. Hence, finding technology stocks with the potential to beat earnings estimates can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple.\n\nYou could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chances to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\r\n\r\nOur research shows that for stocks with this combination of ingredients, the odds of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.\n\nTop Bets\n\nThe five technology stocks mentioned below have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle:\n\nWesterville, OH-based Vertiv has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe company is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has increased by a penny to 37 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nVertiv Holdings Co. price-eps-surprise | Vertiv Holdings Co.

        "content": "Meta has unveiled the next version of large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, as the tech giant looks to take on ChatGPT.\n\nCalled Llama 3, Meta said the latest version of the model is smarter and faster, as well as supporting “improved reasoning”.\n\nIt will first be integrated into Meta AI, the firm’s own virtual assistant, and one that Meta now claims is the “most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free” because of the additional power Llama 3 gives it.\n\nMeta is one of a number of big tech firms fighting to challenge market leader OpenAI, whose ChatGPT has become the most prominent of the new generation of generative AI tools.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor this launch, Meta AI is being made more prominent and accessible within Meta’s apps – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger – while also getting a standalone website, which positions it as a direct competitor to ChatGPT for the first time.\n\nWith our latest advances in Meta Llama 3, Meta AI is now smarter and better than ever. You can use Meta AI in @facebook, @instagram, @messenger and @WhatsApp to get things done and access real-time info without having to leave the app you’re using. pic.twitter.com/a42pa6bOcr\n\n— Meta Newsroom (@MetaNewsroom) April 18, 2024\n\nAn enhanced image generation tool, which is being tested inside WhatsApp, is being rolled out too.\n\nMeta also confirmed it was expanding the availability of Meta AI to a number of countries outside the US, but it remains unavailable in the UK and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\n“With our most powerful large language model under the hood, Meta AI is better than ever. We’re excited to share our next-generation assistant with even more people and can’t wait to see how it enhances people’s lives,” the tech giant said in a blog post on the launch.\n\nIt added that its assistant would also be available within its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and was coming to the Quest virtual reality platform.\n\nThe company said it planned to introduce more Llama 3 models in the near future to make the model both multi-lingual and multi-modal – meaning it can take in and respond in not only text, but images, video and audio.\n\nIn a Facebook post on the rollout, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said: “We’re releasing the new version of Meta AI, our assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses. Our goal is to build the world’s leading AI.\n\n“We’re upgrading Meta AI with our new state-of-the-art Llama 3 AI model, which we’re open sourcing. With this new model, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\n\n“We’re making Meta AI easier to use by integrating it into the search boxes at the top of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger. We also built a website, meta.ai, for you to use on web.\n\n“We also built some unique creation features, like the ability to animate photos. Meta AI now generates high quality images so fast that it creates and updates them in real-time as you’re typing. It’ll also generate a playback video of your creation process.”",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These Are the 3 Tech Stocks Billionaires Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Technology stocks have been in high demand over the past year or so, driving the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite to new heights. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to lead that charge higher.\n\nLike many investors, billionaires are intrigued by the potential to profit from these next-generation algorithms and have piled into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. Recent research by The Motley Fool shines a light on the most popular technology stocks held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to almost no one that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is near the top of the list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in facilitating AI processing, leading to triple-digit revenue and profit gains last year and headlines galore. What they might find surprising, however, is that two AI tech stocks are owned by more hedge funds, while another is neck and neck with Nvidia.\n\nLet's look at the three tech stocks -- not named Nvidia -- that are most widely held by billionaire hedge fund managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires' Favorite Tech Stocks\n\nResearchers at The Motley Fool examined 16 hedge funds that are run by billionaires to ascertain what some of the wealthiest investors had in their portfolios. The data was obtained by reviewing each of the funds' fourth-quarter 2023 13F forms -- the quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of each quarter. The report discloses their portfolio holdings.\n\nThe study then compiled a list of the technology stocks that appeared in the top-10 holdings of more than one of the hedge funds reviewed. And the results were telling.\n\nAlphabet: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). BlueCrest Capital Management (Michael Platt). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Soros Fund Management (George Soros). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company's dominant Google Search gives it access to a vast treasure trove of data, which is needed to adequately train generative AI models. Its search business also forms the foundation for its industry-leading, digital-advertising business, capturing roughly 30% of the market last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman, who is also a fan, detailed the reasoning behind Pershing Square Capital's large stake in Alphabet: \"We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model.\" He went on to cite the stock's compelling valuation -- which is still attractive -- currently trading at less than 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, making it one of the best bargains among AI tech stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META)(NASDAQ: GOOG) also topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Renaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company boasts the world's most widely used family of social media platforms. About 3.2 billion people visit one of its sites every day, and 4 billion stop by monthly. This provides the company with a large horde of data. Meta surprised tech aficionados by developing its own Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is now available for hire on all the major cloud platforms, representing an entirely new revenue stream.\n\nIts AI chops aside, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates recently addressed some of the market's most popular tech stocks, saying he views \"Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap.\" Dalio has a point, and that might help explain Meta's popularity among the billionaire set. Meta is currently selling for about 25 times forward earnings, a discount compared to a current multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft: A top-10 holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was tied with Nvidia, a top holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\n\nWhile Microsoft's software offerings and recurring revenue are no doubt appealing, the company has a big catalyst directly tied to AI -- namely, its generative AI-powered assistant, Copilot, a suite of helpers deeply integrated into the company's most popular products and services.\n\nCopilot streamlines a growing list of otherwise time-consuming tasks, helping users to be more productive. In fact, the initial versions were so successful Microsoft is rolling out a number of job-specific Copilots geared toward the sales, customer service, and finance industries, which will likely enjoy similar success.\n\nWe don't yet know how much this program will add to Microsoft's sales, but the numbers will likely be significant. Billionaire Dan Loeb of Third Points suggests the introduction of Copilot \"could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027.\n\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft isn't nearly as cheap as the other two stocks in our trio, but consider this: The company already has a clear path to profit from AI, which could be lucrative.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ChatGPT developer OpenAI hired its first employee in India, appointing a government relations head just as the country votes in a new administration that will shape artificial intelligence regulations in the world’s most populous nation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding Israel Launches Retaliatory Strike on Iran, US Officials Say These Are the World’s Best Airports in 2024\n\nThe Microsoft Corp. backed-company recruited Pragya Misra to lead public policy affairs and partnerships in India, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the appointment isn’t yet public. Misra, 39, previously worked at Truecaller AB and Meta Platforms Inc. and is set to start at OpenAI toward the end of the month.\n\nThe hiring highlights the generative-AI company’s efforts to push for favorable rules as governments around the world consider how to regulate the rapidly developing technology. India — with its 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing economy — is a massive growth opportunity for global tech companies, but it’s also proven a difficult one to navigate because of lawmakers and regulators seeking to ensure local firms don’t get trampled.\n\nOpenAI representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment outside regular US office hours. Misra didn’t immediately respond to a LinkedIn message.\n\nMisra previously headed public affairs at Stockholm-traded contact verification firm Truecaller, which counts India as a top market. Before that, she was at Meta Platforms Inc., where she led WhatsApp’s campaign against misinformation in 2018.\n\nIn India, OpenAI faces competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is developing an AI model specifically for the country. Its product will be able to handle more than 100 local languages across speech and text, a drive that would widen internet access beyond the country’s urban English-speaking minority.\n\nCountries such as India should support AI research in ways that can improve government services like health care, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said during his visit to India last year.\n\n“The main thing that I think is important is figuring out how to integrate these technologies into other services,” Altman said at the time. “That is an area that I think governments are behind on, and don’t have the answers yet.”\n\nAltman, who met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the tour, also said that India was an early adopter of its generative-AI service ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltman has previously called for more regulations and said his “greatest fear” is that the technology would cause significant harm. He has also said that big regulatory changes weren’t needed for current versions of the technology, but would be soon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 19 best alternatives to Discord in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Alternatives to Discord in 2024.\n\nAn Overview of the Unified Communication and Collaboration Market\n\nDiscord is a unified communication and collaboration software originally designed as a gaming community platform in 2015. The platform features voice, video, streaming, and text communication services to build digital communities on various topics. Discord has over 150 million monthly active users, with over 19 million active servers per week. Although the platform was initially started to help build gaming communities as an alternative to Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, the platform has the potential to be used for other social and business-related activities. According to CNBC, more than 78% of Discord users claim that they now use the platform for mainly non-gaming or equally across gaming and other activities. You can also look at 13 Best Alternatives to Dating Apps and Online Dating and 12 Best Drupal Alternatives in 2024.\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the unified communications and collaborations market was valued at $145.58 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 27.80% during the forecasted period, reaching $496.3 billion by 2029. Traditionally, the unified communications and collaboration market was limited to a single product industry, where organizations or users had to buy tools separately. However, with technological advancements such as cloud management services, holistic platforms including but not limited to Discord, Skype, and Slack by Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) have emerged as one-stop platforms for organizations and individuals. On April 8, Iqvia Holdings Inc (NYSE:IQV), a leading global data provider related to the life sciences industry, announced its partnership with Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Under this collaboration, Iqvia Holdings Inc (NYSE:IQV) will help accelerate the development of Salesforce Inc.

You can also look at the 17 Best AOL Mail Alternatives in 2024.\n\nWhile COVID-19 hindered growth in other industries, the unified communications and collaborations market benefited from the pandemic due to the global increase in remote work. A report by Forbes Advisor that analyzed the post-pandemic work situation in 2023 found that approximately 12.7% of the full-time employees were working from home. Moreover, around 28.2% of the employees adapted to at least a hybrid model since the pandemic. The transition towards remote work led companies towards online unified communications and collaboration platforms. According to another report by Forbes, Zoom Video Communications Inc’s (NASDAQ:ZM) annual revenue during the first fiscal quarter after the pandemic increased by 169%, with 81% of this revenue originating from new subscription customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players Leading the Unified Communication and Collaboration Market\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) are some of the leading providers of unified communications and collaboration software.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading developer and provider of software technology products and services.

The collaboration will strengthen the market collaboration with Citrix, the business unit of Cloud Software Group that provides secure apps for organizations to ensure secure and flexible work around the globe to develop virtual applications and desktop platforms. The collaboration will also lead to the development of new cloud technologies and artificial intelligence solutions with an integrated product roadmap to enhance Microsoft Cloud and AI capabilities.\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another leading integrator of networking, collaboration, security, application, and cloud technologies. The company operates through various segments; the business collaboration solutions segment provides services, including unified communications, conferencing, and collaboration end-point devices. One of the most popular unified communication software by Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the Webex Suite, which allows organizations to connect, manage, collaborate, and engage in a virtual work environment. On April 12, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) announced that it had completed the acquisition of Isovalent Inc., a leading open-source, cloud-native networking and security company. As a result of this acquisition, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) will be able to provide artificial intelligence and cloud technology-driven secure collaboration platforms to organizations of all sizes.\n\nZoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) is an all-in-one AI-powered collaboration platform that provides unified collaboration and connects people via chat, secured meetings, content sharing, and more. On March 25, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) announced its partnership with Avaya to deliver enhanced collaboration experiences to enterprises worldwide.

To rank, we selected the number of number of reviews as our primary metric and customer ratings as our secondary metric. We sourced the customer reviews and ratings from 3 sources, including Capterra, Getapp, and G2.

        "content": "Identifying the next growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 is a noteworthy endeavor. The Magnificent 7 refers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have dominated the technology sector for years.\n\nThese mega-cap companies have delivered extraordinary returns, shaping the market and our daily lives. However, as with all empires, some continue to rise and others fall causing a shift in dominance. While these growth stocks listed above aren’t necessarily losing their mojo, a few could be replaced with Wall Street’s next generation of favorites.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is undoubtedly one of the top prospects to become a Magnificent 7 killer over the next decade. The company is at the forefront of the AI revolution, set to deliver superior returns and capital to shareholders.\n\nBroadcom is a titan in the semiconductor industry, with diverse product offerings serving the data center, network, broadband, wireless and industrial markets. They power everything from smartphones to IoT devices. With the growing demand for connectivity and cloud offerings, Broadcom stands tall as a major beneficiary. However, investors are most excited about the company’s AI tailwinds, which are set to accelerate revenue, EPS and FCF from operations. Its customer silicon chip for AI workloads continues to see unprecedented demand, as hyperscalers ramp up its product offerings. Additionally, Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware in 2023 further solidifies its position in the enterprise software market. That makes Broadcom one of the best growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 stocks for years to come.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to showcase its ability to weather storms and emerge as a leading contender for the top growth stocks to challenge the Magnificent 7. The company underwent major restructuring in 2023, and its new business model and cost-cutting efforts have proven material.\n\nNetflix took serious measures to improve many aspects of their business. Firstly, the company cut costs by $300 million in 2023. Secondly, it finally started to crack down on password sharing, which had been a huge crutch to the business. Moreover, its new ad plan membership was a genius move, boosting its global subscribers while allowing the company to appeal to a wider audience. In FY23, Netflix saw record revenue, earnings and FCF. Net earnings increased 21% YOY to $12.03 per share, with FCF up 328% to a record $6.92 billion. The company is not shying away from the competition in streaming, aiming to unlock new revenue growth opportunities in live gaming and sports-adjacent programming. Netflix’s new strategy is working, and investors should not ignore its margin expansion capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the best sleeper AI stocks with incredible long-term potential. Its expansive suite of creative software, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat, is leading the generative AI boom.\n\nAdobe’s tools are indispensable for graphic designers, photographers, videographers and creative professionals. Its transition to a subscription-based model has proven invaluable, ensuring recurring revenue streams while building a loyal customer base. However, the major catalyst for growth is Adobe Sensei GenAI, a co-pilot software to accelerate productivity and design all in one suite. It is well-equipped with market automation, analytics, testing and other AI intelligence to drive outcomes for its customers. The platform continues to gain traction, and its FY23 results only showcased a sliver of its potential. With the profitability and cash flows to drive long-term growth, Adobe remains one of the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Meta releases early versions of its Llama 3 AI model",
        "content": "(Adds examples of use, comparison of performance quality, analyst comment, share price, paragraphs 2, 4, 10, 16-17 and 19)\n\nBy Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms on Thursday released early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3, and an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts, as it races to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI.\n\nThe models will be integrated into its virtual assistant Meta AI, which the company is pitching as the most sophisticated of its free-to-use peers, citing performance comparisons on subjects like reasoning, coding and creative writing against offerings from rivals including Alphabet's Google and French startup Mistral AI.\n\nThe updated Meta AI assistant will be given more prominent billing within Meta's Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps as well as a new standalone website that positions it to compete more directly with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's breakout hit, ChatGPT.\n\nA landing page greeting visitors on that site prompts them to try having the assistant create a vacation packing list, play 1990s music trivia with them, provide homework help and paint pictures of the New York City skyline.\n\nMeta has been scrambling to push generative AI products out to its billions of users to challenge OpenAI's leading position on the technology, involving a pricey overhaul of computing infrastructure and the consolidation of previously distinct research and product teams.\n\nThe social media giant has been openly releasing its Llama models for use by developers building AI apps as part of its catch-up effort, as a powerful free option could stymie rivals' plans to earn revenue off their proprietary technology. The strategy has elicited safety concerns from critics wary of what unscrupulous actors may use the model to build.\n\nMeta equipped Llama 3 with new computer coding capabilities and fed it images as well as text in training this time, though for now the model will output only text, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview.\n\nMore advanced reasoning, like the ability to craft longer multi-step plans, will follow in subsequent versions, he added. Versions planned for release in the coming months will also be capable of \"multimodality,\" meaning they can generate both text and images, Meta said in blog posts.\n\n\"The goal eventually is to help take things off your plate, just help make your life easier, whether it's interacting with businesses, whether it's writing something, whether it's planning a trip,\" Cox said.\n\nStory continues\n\nCox said the inclusion of images in the training of Llama 3 would enhance an update rolling out this year to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, a product made with glasses maker Essilor Luxoticca, enabling Meta AI to identify objects seen by the wearer and answer questions about them.\n\nMeta shares were up 1.8% late on Thursday.\n\nMeta also announced a partnership with Google to include its real-time search results in the assistant's responses, supplementing an existing arrangement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant is expanding to more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meta is \"still working on the right way to do this in Europe,\" Cox said, where privacy rules are more stringent and the forthcoming AI Act is poised to impose requirements like disclosure of models' training data.\n\nGenerative AI models' voracious need for data has emerged as a major source of tension in the technology's development.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded at the competition with OpenAI in a video accompanying the announcement, in which he called Meta AI \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nZuckerberg said the two smaller versions of Llama 3 rolling out now, with 8 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters, scored favorably against other free models on performance benchmarks commonly used to assess model quality. The biggest version of Llama 3 is still being trained, with 400 billion parameters, he said.\n\nThose results were \"undoubtedly impressive,\" but also indicative of a growing performance gap between free and proprietary models, said Nathan Benaich, founder of AI-focused venture firm Air Street Capital.\n\nDevelopers have complained that the previous Llama 2 version of the model failed to understand basic context, confusing queries on how to \"kill\" a computer program with requests for instructions on committing murder. Rival Google has run into similar problems and recently paused use of its Gemini AI image generation tool after it drew criticism for churning out inaccurate depictions of historical figures.\n\nMeta said it cut down on those problems in Llama 3 by using \"high quality data\" to get the model to recognize nuance. It did not elaborate on the datasets used, although it said it fed seven times more data into Llama 3 than it used for Llama 2.

        "content": "Tech stocks have dominated for the better part of the past two decades. Much of this recent growth has been fueled by the recent surge of interest in AI. Investors expect ongoing growth, crucial for portfolio returns. However, finding the best large-cap tech stock winners in this space isn’t an easy task. There are so many companies to choose from in a range of high-growth industries.\n\nThat’s where this list comes in. I’ve looked at hundreds of trailblazing tech stocks over the years, and these three are some of the best operators in their core sectors. I think over time, long-term investors can’t go wrong owning these names.\n\nOf course, a number of headwinds could hurt this thesis over short periods of time. But for those looking to invest for the long term, here’s why I’d focus my research efforts on these three tech stock winners right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) has emerged as a potential Wall Street favorite, leveraging its position as a leading e-commerce platform provider with ongoing innovation. While initially catering to small businesses, Shopify now attracts more prominent brands, facilitated by Shopify Plus, tailored for global retailers. Its modern retail stack appeals to diverse industries, from subscription-based ventures.\n\nThe company’s success rides on e-commerce growth, sustained by continuous innovation and AI integration. Recent restructuring efforts have bolstered profitability and liquidity. Investors eye Shopify’s potential to generate substantial free cash flow in the coming years.\n\nRecently, Shopify partnered with Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) and Google Cloud to boost digitalization for retailers globally, merging commerce platforms, cloud infrastructure and retail expertise. That collaboration aims to modernize retail operations, enhance customer experiences, and enable scalable commerce platforms leveraging advanced technologies.\n\nIf the company continues to see accelerated growth from such partnerships, its current valuation could be deemed very attractive a few years from now.\n\nZoom Video (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuring the pandemic, video conferencing technology became a staple for most households. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) took the lead in this sector, becoming a household name. And of late, the company has translated its top-line growth into profitability, something long-term investors like to see.\n\nIn Q4, Zoom brought in $667 million in Enterprise revenue but notably brought in even more impressive bottom-line growth. Now trading at only 29 times earnings, this is a tech stock I really look at as a value play in an integral sector. The company’s shift towards enterprise revenue suggests the potential for even greater accelerated long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the Enterprise Connect conference in Orlando, Zoom Video Communications introduced new features for its AI-driven platform, Zoom Workplace, enhancing communication efficiency. That update integrates artificial intelligence across meetings, chat and phone systems, streamlining workflows. The company’s AI companion, integral to Zoom Workplace, unifies all Zoom tools, demonstrating Zoom’s dedication to accessible technology.\n\nZoom’s AI companion now detects languages and offers better summarization, improving user experiences. It integrates with external platforms like Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace for seamless collaboration. Zoom addresses users’ privacy concerns by ensuring AI model training without using customer or third-party data.\n\nIf the surge in AI-related stocks continues, Zoom should benefit over time.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmerging as one of Nasdaq’s top-performing stocks and a member of the Magnificent Seven, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) boasts an impressive surge over the past year. The company’s strategic shift from the metaverse to AI and effective cost-saving measures drove Meta’s exceptional operational results. Meta consistently exceeded analyst expectations throughout the year, reporting significant revenue and net income increases across all four quarters.\n\nWith an expanding operating margin and strong free cash flow of $43 billion, Meta remains a leader in digital advertising, making it an attractive addition to investment portfolios.\n\nMeta’s primary revenue source is its suite of free social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, which collectively contributed 98% of its revenue in 2023, mainly from advertising. With a substantial user base and engagement levels, Meta commands around 20% of the U.S. digital advertising market, second only to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite fluctuations tied to economic cycles, the digital advertising sector offers considerable growth potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "As Meta debuts its Llama 3 model, today’s generative AI landscape is a different animal",
        "content": "Meta today debuted updated versions of its free Llama AI model, which has been among the most popular open-source models in the market but which has faced increasing competition from both other open-source contenders and companies offering paid closed access models. Called Llama 3, the new set of models represent Meta’s attempt to match some of the capabilities currently being offered by rivals such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in their latest models, but which so far have only been available in closed, paid proprietary services.\n\nMeta said it wants the most capable Llama 3 models to be multimodal, meaning they can take in text, images, and even video and then generate outputs in all of those different formats. Meta is also aiming to make the models multilingual, with larger “context windows,” meaning they can be fed ample amounts of data to analyze or summarize. (Larger context windows have also been shown to reduce a model’s hallucination rate, or how often it outputs inaccurate information in response to a prompt.) The Llama models boast improved reasoning and coding capabilities, too, according to Meta.\n\nAs many industry-watchers had expected, the company has initially released two smaller versions of Llama 3, which it said in a press release “are the best open-source models of their class, period” and will be available shortly on platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, and Hugging Face. But these models are not as capable as some of the most high-performing proprietary models in the market.\n\nA much larger version of Llama 3—with more than 400 billion parameters—is still being trained, with the company saying it will make a decision on whether and how to release it following safety testing in the coming months.\n\nBut Ragavan Srinivasan, Meta’s VP of product in charge of Llama, told Fortune that this larger version is “trending to be on par with some of the best-in-class proprietary models that you see out in the market today,” adding that it will have additional capabilities “baked into it.” These capabilities would match or exceed what is currently on offer from models such as Claude 3, Gemini, or GPT-4.\n\nThe Llama 3 announcement accompanied the release of a new version of Meta AI, the company’s assistant that will now be powered by Llama 3 and built into the search box at the top of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger—integrating real-time knowledge from Google and Bing into its answers.\n\n“We believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said as part of the announcement. Meta’s AI assistant received mixed reviews after its original launch in September 2023, particularly its cast of celebrity AI characters that sometimes responded inappropriately. And even as recently as yesterday, there were reports that Meta’s AI unexpectedly commented in a Facebook group for parents.\n\nStory continues\n\nA highly competitive AI model landscape\n\nMeta is launching Llama 3 into a generative AI landscape that is far different from the one that greeted its predecessor, Llama 2, when it debuted last summer. Since then, open-source AI has exploded, even as debate has swirled over the security and safety of AI models that allow users open access to source code and model weights.\n\nThe Paris-based Mistral burst onto the scene in June 2023, cofounded by former Meta researchers—and it has released a variety of well-received open-source models, while just this week it was reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation. Two months ago Google released Gemma, open models built from the same research and technology as its proprietary Gemini.\n\nMeanwhile, the capabilities of proprietary models such as those developed by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic keep advancing—but at ever greater costs, given the massive amounts of compute necessary to train them. Meta, in fact, is one of the Big Tech leaders in spending on training and running models: In January, Mark Zuckerberg indicated that Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia AI chips, saying that by the end of 2024, the company’s computing infrastructure will include 350,000 H100s. But Meta has also committed to making its models freely available as open-source products in hopes that it will control the platform on which others are building and eventually find a way to monetize that position. It’s an expensive strategy with no certain path to profits anytime soon.\n\nFinally, the war for AI talent continues to heat up, with fierce competition for top researchers and many former Big Tech engineers jumping ship to launch their own startups. As Fortune recently reported, Meta has seen its own AI brain drain of late, with several high-level departures, including its senior director of generative AI. This has significant impact on the generative AI race that Zuckerberg is running: If Meta wants to stay ahead, it needs to make sure it can hold on to the top AI talent most qualified to build these models. Conversely, building best-in-breed models helps attract the top talent, who are generally drawn to the most ambitious AI labs.\n\nAI is Meta’s top priority\n\nAI has become Meta’s top priority, replacing the company’s earlier emphasis on the metaverse, so it clearly plans to do what it takes to stand out in a crowded field. Last October, Zuckerberg said that “AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024, both in engineering and computer resources.” As part of today’s Llama announcement, he doubled down on that theme, saying, “We’re investing massively to build the leading AI.”\n\nMeta has also been a longtime champion of open-source research. It created an open-source ecosystem around the PyTorch framework and recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), which was created “to advance the state of the art of AI through open research for the benefit of all” and has been led by Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun.\n\nIt was LeCun who pushed for Llama 2 to be released with a commercial license along with the model weights. “I advocated for this internally,” he said at the AI Native conference in September 2023. “I thought it was inevitable, because large language models are going to become a basic infrastructure that everybody is going to use; it has to be open.”\n\nManohar Paluri, a Meta vice president in the AI organization, told Fortune that today’s intense open-source AI competition makes the company feel “supported and validated in our mission of accelerating innovation and doing it in the open so we can build safer and more productive models that get better and better with each iteration.” The more models that are built on top of each other, including on Llama, “the faster we can actually make progress on enabling more use cases for the end users.”\n\nDigging into Meta’s Llama 3 data\n\nMeta did not disclose specifics about what data was used to train Llama 3, other than to emphasize that it was trained on a “variety of public data”—which the company previously admitted includes public Facebook and Instagram posts—and “excluded and removed data from certain sources known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals.”\n\nMeta did say that the training dataset was seven times as large as the one used to train the previous version, Llama 2, and includes four times as much as code. Over 5% of the Llama 3 pretraining dataset consists of “high-quality non-English data that covers over 30 languages.”\n\nIn addition, Meta disclosed that previous versions of Llama were used to train Llama 3. “We found that previous generations of Llama are good at identifying high-quality data, so we used Llama 2 to build the text-quality classifiers that are used to power Llama 3. We also leveraged synthetic data to train in areas such as coding, reasoning, and long context. For example, we used synthetic data to create longer documents.”\n\nMeta’s race for AI dominance\n\nBut as Llama 3 leaps into the wild, the bottom line is that Meta will have to keep running fast—and spending big—in order to fulfill Mark Zuckerberg’s bid for AI dominance. Catching up to OpenAI while still promoting open source will be no small feat, but if any organization has the will, and the money, to make it happen, it is Meta.\n\nOf course, the larger question is why? What’s in all this for Meta? Strategically, Zuckerberg seems committed to ensuring that if AI is the next big platform shift—as many investors and analysts contend—that Meta is not beholden to another platform. Zuckerberg sees leadership in the AI race as the way Meta can remain the master of its own fate.\n\nCorrection, April 18: An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Meta had already decided to release the largest and most powerful version of Llama 3 as an open-source AI model. The story has been updated to clarify that Meta has not yet made this decision, and to provide additional context about the model’s size and future safety testing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta's newest AI model beats some peers. But its amped-up AI agents are confusing Facebook users",
        "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Generative AI is advancing so quickly that the latest chatbots available today could be out of date tomorrow.\n\nGoogle, Meta Platforms and OpenAI, along with startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France’s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they've got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots.\n\nMeta is the latest to up its game, unveiling new models Thursday that will be among the most visible: they're already getting baked into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. But in a sign of the technology's ongoing limitations, Meta's amped-up AI agents have been spotted this week confusing Facebook users by posing as people with made-up life experiences.\n\nWhile Meta is saving the most powerful of its AI models, called Llama 3, for later, it's publicly releasing two smaller versions of the same Llama 3 system that power its Meta AI assistant. AI models are trained on vast pools of data to generate responses, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. The publicly released models were built with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters — a measurement of how much data the system is trained on. A bigger, roughly 400 billion-parameter model is still in training.\n\n“The vast majority of consumers don’t candidly know or care too much about the underlying base model, but the way they will experience it is just as a much more useful, fun and versatile AI assistant,” said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, in an interview.\n\nSome Facebook users are already experiencing Meta's AI agents in unusual ways. Earlier this week, a chatbot with the official Meta AI label inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by human members of the group, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press.\n\n“Apologies for the mistake! I'm just a large language model, I don't have experiences or children,” the chatbot told the moms' group.\n\nClegg said Wednesday he wasn't aware of the exchange. Facebook's online help page says the Meta AI agent will join a group conversation if invited, or if someone “asks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.”\n\nIn another example shown to the AP on Thursday, the agent confused members of a “Buy Nothing” forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. The agent offered a “gently used” digital camera and an “almost new-portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.” A member of the Facebook group tried to engage it before realizing no such items existed.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta said in a written statement Thursday that “this is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.” The company said it is constantly working to improve the features and trying to make users aware of the limitations.\n\nClegg did say that Meta's AI agent is loosening up a bit. Some people found the earlier Llama 2 model — released less than a year ago — to be “a little stiff and sanctimonious sometimes in not responding to what were often perfectly innocuous or innocent prompts and questions,” he said.\n\nIn the year after ChatGPT sparked a generative AI frenzy, the tech industry and academia introduced some 149 large AI systems trained on massive datasets, more than double the year before, according to a Stanford University survey.\n\nThey may eventually hit a limit — at least when it comes to data, said Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.\n\n“I think it’s been clear that if you scale the models on more data, they can become increasingly better,\" he said. \"But at the same time, these systems are already trained on percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.”\n\nMore data — acquired and ingested at costs only tech giants can afford, and increasingly subject to copyright disputes and lawsuits — will continue to drive improvements. “Yet they still cannot plan well,” Maslej said. \"They still hallucinate. They’re still making mistakes in reasoning.”\n\nGetting to AI systems that can perform higher-level cognitive tasks and commonsense reasoning — where humans still excel— might require a shift beyond building ever-bigger models.\n\nFor the flood of businesses trying to adopt generative AI, which model they choose could depend on several factors, including cost. Language models, in particular, have been used to power customer service chatbots, write reports and financial insights and summarize long documents.\n\n“You’re seeing companies kind of looking at fit, testing each of the different models for what they’re trying to do and finding some that are better at some areas rather than others,” said Todd Lohr, a leader in technology consulting at KPMG.\n\nUnlike other model developers selling their AI services to other businesses, Meta is largely designing its AI products for consumers — those using its advertising-fueled social networks. Joelle Pineau, Meta’s vice president of AI research, said at a London event last week the company's goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI \"the most useful assistant in the world.”\n\n“In many ways, the models that we have today are going to be child’s play compared to the models coming in five years,” she said.\n\nBut she said the “question on the table” is whether researchers have been able to fine tune its bigger Llama 3 model so that it’s safe to use and doesn’t, for example, hallucinate or engage in hate speech. In contrast to leading proprietary systems from Google and OpenAI, Meta has so far advocated for a more open approach, publicly releasing key components of its AI systems for others to use.\n\n“It’s not just a technical question,\" Pineau said. \"It is a social question. What is the behavior that we want out of these models? How do we shape that? And if we keep on growing our model ever more in general and powerful without properly socializing them, we are going to have a big problem on our hands.”\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Turn $200K Into $1 Million: April 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse market is hard to pin down. It integrates so many different technologies, it often seems nebulous. But it’s exactly this diversity, from blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to the Internet of Things (IoT) and extended reality that makes the metaverse an inevitable outcome. Also, it makes metaverse stocks a compelling consideration.\n\nAfter the hype died down in August 2023, Bain & Company forecasted that metaverse market size could reach $900 billion by 2030. The caveat? The market’s seed stage will last at least five years.\n\nBut just as it happened with digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC-USD), early exposure is where the highest returns begin. So are these winning seedlings visible now? Let’s explore three such stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) The Unity Software website is displayed on a laptop screen. U stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), Unity Software (NASDAQ:U) is down 39%. From its 52-week low of $22.20, U shares are now just 12.3% away. Despite a pricing scheme mishap that resulted in Unity CEO resigning, it remains a powerhouse of content creation.\n\nClearly, the Metaverse will need easily accessible and streamlined content-creation tools. And Unity Software is the most versatile platform to do it. Unity Software is handling the entire content pipeline from 3D assets to animation and physics. Also, it is birthing hits such as Ori and the Blind Forest, Escape from Tarkov and Pillars of Eternity.\n\nAlthough Epic Games with its Unreal Engine (UE) is gaining traction, it is not a publicly traded company. Moreover, it is so versatile that 49% of developers using Unity Software dab into Unreal Engine. But 76% of UE developers dab into Unity Software, according to SlashData.\n\nThis is visible from U’s 35% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q4 of 2023 revenue. However, the company tools’ development is still offset by lack of monetization, having incurred a net loss of $253.9 million in the quarter versus $287.7 million loss in Q4 of 2022.\n\nTo get into the green profit zone, Unity Software is deploying multiple measures. Those include a 25% workforce reduction, cloud hosting, reducing the need for offices and making software licenses more appealing for growth.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport Silicon Valley exterior sign and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nYTD, Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is down 30%. At its 52-week low of $1.74, this penny metaverse stock is 5.9% away from revisiting the bottom. Although in competition with Autodesk’s (NASDAQ:ADSK) Construction Cloud, Matterport is disruptive in its attempt to digitize the real world via subscriptions and licensing.\n\nStory continues\n\nEliminating time and energy to procure metaverse assets from scratch, Matterport uses a 3D lidar camera system to capture the physical world. Its Cortex AI platform then crunches the data into interactive 3D assets. Similar to geospatial mapping systems, Matterport licenses the captured data to third parties with multi-channel sales strategy.\n\nIn April, the company surpassed one million subscription milestones. Making 60% of revenue, Matterport’s subscription revenue grew 23% YOY in Q4 2023. Like many startups, it operates at a net loss. But, it has been steadily dwindling. For example, it was $65.7 million for full-year 2023 versus $116.6 million in 2022.\n\nThus, consider its present price level of $1.85 versus Nasdaq’s average price target of $3.88. Therefore, MTTR is one of the cheapest and potentially most profitable metaverse stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

Further, it’s an exceptionally large one owing to market dominance of Quest virtual reality (VR) headsets.\n\nAlthough Meta’s Reality Labs division has yet to reach profitability, the company has deep enough pockets without needing seed funding. Moreover, Mark Zuckerberg mastered the craft of utilizing user data. This makes it more likely for Meta Platforms, as a social capital engineering company, to anticipate metaverse user needs.\n\nWith the integration of AI agents into Meta Platforms, the company is closer than any at combining all metaverse aspects. Best of all for investors, the stock is a relatively safe exposure, with shares are up 42% YTD. At an average price target of $543.4 versus current $500, META is becoming increasingly more attractive, both long-term and short-term.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Meta releases early versions of its Llama 3 AI model",
        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms on Thursday released early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3, and an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts, as it races to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI.\n\nThe models will be integrated into virtual assistant Meta AI, which the company is pitching as the most sophisticated of its free-to-use peers. The assistant will be given more prominent billing within Meta's Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps as well as a new standalone website that positions it to compete more directly with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's breakout hit ChatGPT.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta has been scrambling to push generative AI products out to its billions of users to challenge OpenAI's leading position on the technology, involving an overhaul of computing infrastructure and the consolidation of previously distinct research and product teams.\n\nThe social media giant equipped Llama 3 with new computer coding capabilities and fed it images as well as text this time, though for now the model will output only text, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview.\n\nMore advanced reasoning, like the ability to craft longer multi-step plans, will follow in subsequent versions, he added. Versions planned for release in the coming months will also be capable of \"multimodality,\" meaning they can generate both text and images, Meta said in blog posts.\n\n\"The goal eventually is to help take things off your plate, just help make your life easier, whether it's interacting with businesses, whether it's writing something, whether it's planning a trip,\" Cox said.\n\nCox said the inclusion of images in the training of Llama 3 would enhance an update rolling out this year to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, a partnership with glasses maker Essilor Luxoticca, enabling Meta AI to identify objects seen by the wearer and answer questions about them.\n\nMeta also announced a new partnership with Alphabet's Google to include real-time search results in the assistant's responses, supplementing an existing arrangement with Microsoft's Bing.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant is expanding to more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meta is \"still working on the right way to do this in Europe,\" Cox said, where privacy rules are more stringent and the forthcoming AI Act is poised to impose requirements like disclosure of models' training data.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI models' voracious need for data has emerged as a major source of tension in the technology's development.\n\nMeta has been releasing models like Llama 3 for free commercial use by developers as part of its catch-up effort, as the success of a powerful free option could stymie rivals' plans to earn revenue off their proprietary technology. The strategy has also elicited safety concerns from critics wary of what unscrupulous developers may use the model to build.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded at that competition in a video accompanying the announcement, in which he called Meta AI \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nZuckerberg said the biggest version of Llama 3 is currently being trained with 400 billion parameters and already scoring 85 MMLU, citing metrics used to convey the strength and performance quality of AI models. The two smaller versions rolling out now have 8 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters, and the latter scored around 82 MMLU, or Massive Multitask Language Understanding, he said.\n\nDevelopers have complained that the previous Llama 2 version of the model failed to understand basic context, confusing queries on how to \"kill\" a computer program with requests for instructions on committing murder. Rival Google has run into similar problems and recently paused use of its Gemini AI image generation tool after it drew criticism for churning out inaccurate depictions of historical figures.\n\nMeta said it cut down on those problems in Llama 3 by using \"high quality data\" to get the model to recognize nuance. It did not elaborate on the datasets used, although it said it fed seven times more data into Llama 3 than it used for Llama 2 and leveraged \"synthetic,\" or AI-created, data to strengthen areas like coding and reasoning.\n\nCox said there was \"not a major change in posture\" in terms of how the company sourced its training data.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Must-Have AI Stocks, Fed Rate Cuts or No Fed Rate Cuts",
        "content": "Markets have remained strong in 2024 primarily because of two factors: the emergence of AI stocks and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts this year.\n\nHowever, inflation remains high while other economic signals indicate a strong economy overall. The result is that the Fed can wait to cut rates. In fact, it may. The timeline continues to be pushed back with some pundits suggesting that there may be zero rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThat leads me to believe that investors will redirect their optimism into AI stocks. Those shares will not have the benefit of immediately lower lending rates, however, they benefit from optimism. That optimism suggests that AI is only beginning as a long-term opportunity that will fundamentally change the economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are likely to refocus on the benefits of AI as Fed rate cut hopes dwindle. That should spike demand and prices.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent stock correction is likely to be an opportunity for multiple reasons. First of all, it’s not very serious, and more likely a reflection of current headwinds overall.\n\nThose headwinds include factors like later than expected rate cuts and increased competition from rivals including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nLet’s focus on the latter part of those two factors. Intel just released its latest AI chip called Gaudi 3. Intel claims that the chip is faster and more efficient than Nvidia’s leading H100 chips. It very well may be but the problem is going to be sales. It will be very difficult for Intel and other chip makers to disrupt Nvidia’s dominance. Nvidia did not become the most coveted chip maker by chance. Further, Nvidia is scheduled to release its h200 GPU chips this quarter. Those chips are likely to be superior to Intel’s Gaudi 3 chips. Beyond that, Nvidia is by far the better stock given how successful the company has been in turning AI into earnings. Those earnings jumped by 486% in the December quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has performed exceptionally well over the past year and rebounded very strongly. The company was among the biggest losers during the quantitative tightening era between late 2021 and late 2022.\n\nHowever, Meta Platforms has rebounded. That rebound can be partially attributed to its investment in its Llama AI platform. To be clear, the majority of the rebound is due to the return of advertising revenues that underpin Meta Platform’s business model.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese days, Meta Platforms’ Llama AI model is gaining steam. The firm is set to release Llama 3, the newest iteration of its large language model (LLM). Meta is releasing Llama 3 likely within the next month.\n\nLlama 3 has the potential to be revolutionary. Meta says that the upgrade will be capable of reasoning and planning. That suggests AI is becoming more human overall and  utilitarian. In turn, Meta should be able to better monetize AI, improving its stock as a result. This makes it one of those AI stocks to consider.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) AI prowess and profitability are a potent mix. Again, I believe investors are likely to refocus their capital into AI stocks as the Fed rate cut timeline extends.\n\nThe company is well noted for its AI platforms. Palantir’s ability therein has caused the stock to rise. Palantir is  deserving of the attention it has received due to its fundamental strength. The company has reported five straight quarters of GAAP profitability.\n\nInvestors should look to Palantir for its fundamental success. They should also note that Palantir is quickly shedding its public side reputation and becoming a more commercial, private side endeavor. Commercial revenues grew by 32% in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, government revenues, still high, grew by 11%. This makes it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) moving some of its foundry workloads to the latter firm. The partnership suggests that both Palantir and Oracle are deeply interested in western interests moving forward. The point here being that Palantir is the first choice in regard to that issue and AI.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) stock is very clearly poised to continue heading upward on AI tailwinds. The company is gaining a lot of attention of late for its memory prowess. Its high bandwidth memory (HBM) has quickly become a vital component in the AI race.\n\nMicron was selected as a critical HBM supplier to Nvidia which is an excellent reason to   assume further growth will follow. High bandwidth memory is used to increase the power of AI chips. It is easy to see why Micron then has such a strong opportunity given its connection to Nvidia.\n\nMicron is also benefiting from the premiums associated with that relationship. The company announced that it plans to raise the prices on DRAM and SSD by 25%. Micron is already coming off a stronger than expected quarter and with its new found Nvidia Jr. moniker, is expected to rise much higher. The company should continue to look more attractive as a refocus on AI monetization re-emerges in the wake of recent Fed news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThose slower than expected rate cuts should benefit AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock in the near term.  investors are well aware of the narrative that underpins investing in AMD: the company is the primary competitor of Nvidia for AI chips.\n\nAMD offers a balance of comparable chip specifications at much lower prices. It continues to beg the question: will Nvidia’s perceived dominance soon be perceived as greed? The answer is maybe.\n\nIf some sort of seismic shift occurs and tech firms suddenly switch to AMD chips then of course its shares will move much higher. For now, AMD is simply a strong alternative to Nvidia and the company with a huge opportunity ahead.\n\nCEO Lisa Su predicts massive growth in AI data center chip opportunities in the next few years.  AMD’s  chips are in demand for such applications. That is still the best reason to buy AMD even if the company does not surpass Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of a select few companies that doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts. It is of course also one of the strongest AI stocks overall. I do believe that there will be a refocus on AI as mentioned above. and I do believe that will benefit Microsoft.\n\nSo, let’s first talk about the initial claim that Microsoft doesn’t have to worry much about Fed rate cuts.  That’s true, one of the primary reasons firms are interested in rate cuts is that lower lending rates emerge following any cut. Lower lending rates spur investments in growth opportunities and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is exceptionally cash rich. So, the company can simply chase opportunities as it sees fit without having to rely on lenders.\n\nThat simple truth is yet another reason to consider investing in Microsoft at the moment. The company is of course one of the strongest AI competitors overall. Its investment in ChatGPT has paid off very well. The company does have some issues relating to monetizing its office suite of products but overall is exceptionally strong.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefits from the same operating cash flow strengths as Microsoft. The stock is similarly attractive for that reason. So, I won’t beat a dead horse and instead will focus on Amazon’s primary AI opportunity which is its cloud network, AWS.\n\nCloud computing has traditionally accounted for a major portion of Amazon’s business. However, demand slowed last year as corporate partners slowed their spending. Amazon is looking for ways to strengthen its AI prowess. The company recently invested an additional $2.75 billion into AI startup Anthropic. That raises its total investment to 4 billion  invested in additional 2.75 billion into AI startup anthropic. that raises its total investment to $4 billion overall. This helps to make it one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude AI assistant rivals that of ChatGPT. It’s clear that Amazon hopes to mimic the success of Microsoft in that regard. Overall, Amazon is well positioned as the largest cloud provider. AI investment into cloud workloads is set to strengthen and will benefit Amazon overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Big Tech Earnings Are Just Around the Corner\n\nNext week, part of the Magnificent 7, namely Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) will step into the earnings spotlight, showing the world the way another insight into where it’s headed with the development of generative AI.\n\nMeta’s fourth quarter achievement showed the effectiveness of its strategy to enhance profits.\n\nWith its fourth quarter, Meta smashed estimates with an exceptional performance. Fourth quarter revenue surged 25% YoY to $40.1 billion, with is the most rapid growth that Meta recorded since mid-2021. Along with a cost-cutting initiative with which Meta lowered costs 8% on a YoY basis, its operating margin more than doubled as it reached 41%. This financial strength fueled the net income to more than triple to $14 billion or $5.33 per share. Meta also did a good job at taking care of its user base with 2.11 billion daily active users and 3.07 billion monthly active users, with the average revenue per user reaching $13.12. As for the guidance, Meta guided for 2024’s first quarter revenue to be in the range between $34.5 to $37 billion.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth quarter results market quite a turnaround.\n\nGoogle-parent reported its fourth quarter net income surged 52% YoY to $20.7 billion or $1.64 per share, with significant improvement in profitability as the operating margin expanded from 24% too 27%. The Google Cloud was a key growth driver, recording a YoY revenue rise of 26%, with the segment going from losses to becoming profitable with a positive operating income of $864 million amid a tough competitive landscape where it faces off Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\n\nBut, what investors really want to hear this time is how is Google infusing AI into its offerings. During the last earning report. CEO Sundar Pichai focused on the enduring strength of Google Search and the growing power of the Cloud and YouTube, with both of these areas benefiting from AI development in the Gemini era.\n\nAmazon crushed estimates with record holiday sales\n\nView more earnings on META\n\nWith its fourth quarter results that had record Black Friday and Cyber Monday results, Amazon reported its net salesgrew 14% YoY to $170.0 billion, operating income rose to $13.2 billion, and net income swinged from 2022’s Q4 loss to an income of $10.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for 2023 as a whole, net sales expanded 12% and a net income of  $30.4 billion marked the return of profitability. As for first quarter estimates, Amazon guided for sales growth to continue in the range between 8 and 13%, with operating income exceeding prior year’s result.\n\nAlong with the impact of automation efforts and expansion of drone delivery on efficiency and costs, investors will look at the company’s fastest-growing business segment AWS, along with advertising that should both benefit from AI advancements.\n\nAfter a robust fiscal second quarter, Microsoft will show further how its AI advances are fueling innovation and boosting productivity.\n\nWith its second quarter, Microsoft surpassed analyst estimates with both its top and bottom line. Microsoft posted revenue grew 18% to $62.02 billion with earnings per share amounting to $2.93. Operating income and net income both made a 33% jump. This robust performance was greatly owed to the success of the Intelligent Cloud business whose revenue surged 20% YoY, while Azure and related cloud services alone posted an impressive growth of 30%. As for the fiscal third quarter guidance, Microsoft forecasted revenue in the range between $60 billion and $61 billion. But, what will be under the spotlight is the way CEO Satya Nadella’s words are turning into action, as Nadella commented during the last earnings report that Microsoft went from talking to actually applying AI at a scale.\n\nBesides showing their corporate financial health, these earnings reports will also provide valuable insights about the health of the tech industry as a whole, along with a glimpse of the direction in which the world is headed as the new AI era continues to unfold.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Investing in growth stocks can deliver outsized gains, but investors have to stick with these stocks during volatile stretches. These stocks are more vulnerable to price swings due to macroeconomic factors. These growth stocks to buy now are also held under the microscope each time they report earnings.\n\nInvestors pay more attention to these types of stocks because of the potential payoff. Some growth stocks have become giants within their respective industries while others have the potential to become giants.\n\nIt’s clear why investors buy growth stocks. They want to outperform the stock market. These seven growth stocks to buy now can give you a chance at achieving that objective.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers the world’s most recognizable online marketplace that lists millions of products on its platform. The company processes more than 4,000 product sales every minute.\n\nThe e-commerce segment is Amazon’s main revenue driver, but the company is also seeing plenty of success with its leading cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services has the lion’s share of the cloud computing industry. It has roughly one-third of the total market share and has a big lead over the competition. It’s mostly a duopoly between Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an honorable mention.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its advertising, video streaming, and grocery segments. Amazon recently got accused of attempting to steal Trader Joe’s trade secrets. This isn’t the best look for Amazon, but investors should take note that the company is looking to expand its grocery store footprint through Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. Advertising and streaming are the bigger segments to monitor, but Amazon seems to be putting more effort into its grocery segment. This makes it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSofi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditional bank stocks aren’t considered growth stocks. Those corporations have matured and offer dividend payouts to keep shareholders invested. However, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) isn’t your traditional bank.\n\nThe fintech company operates entirely online, so you can’t drive to a local branch. The company also has many of the financial products you would expect from a big institution. Consumers can get personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, and other products. SoFi has also made great strides in getting mainstream appeal through SoFi Stadium and by becoming the official bank of the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi reported its first profitable quarter in Q4 2023. Net income came to $47.9 million while revenue was $615.4 million. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year and the company ended up with a 7.9% net profit margin.

        "title": "Atlassian (TEAM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Atlassian (TEAM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.1 billion, up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Atlassian?\n\nFor Atlassian, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.90%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Atlassian will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Atlassian would post earnings of $0.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of +17.74%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAtlassian doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Meta Platforms (META) is soon expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +63.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $36.22 billion, up 26.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Meta Platforms has been revised 1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.62%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Meta Platforms will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Beat Nvidia in the Coming Decades",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has enjoyed a remarkable artificial intelligence (AI)-related surge since the beginning of 2023, and that's not surprising as the company is providing the critical building blocks needed for the proliferation of this technology.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are helping its customers train AI models and deploy them, which explains why there is a huge demand for its chips. As a result, Nvidia's revenue and earnings have been growing rapidly in recent quarters, and the good part is that the company could sustain its impressive momentum as more AI infrastructure is built.\n\nHowever, concerns are that an eventual slowdown in AI chip demand could negatively weigh on Nvidia's prospects in the long run. That's why investors should consider buying shares of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- both Nvidia customers -- as these two companies could turn out to be bigger AI beneficiaries than Nvidia decades from now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nJust like Nvidia, Microsoft has been one of the pioneers in the field of AI thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This partnership has placed Microsoft at the forefront of the AI revolution in multiple fast-growing markets.\n\nFrom workplace collaboration software to personal computers (PCs) to cloud computing, Microsoft has been integrating OpenAI's expertise in multiple areas to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, Microsoft's Azure cloud business is now growing at a faster pace thanks to the improving adoption of the company's AI-focused tools, which allow customers to use its platform to build and deploy generative AI solutions.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that out of Microsoft's 53,000-strong Azure AI customer base, a third started using its services in 2023. Additionally, Microsoft management pointed out on the company's January earnings conference call that its Azure cloud business got a boost of 6 percentage points because of AI, clocking year-over-year growth of 30%.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Microsoft's cloud business gaining more traction. That's because its customers can gain access to multiple large language models (LLMs) to build their AI applications without having to invest in expensive hardware. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud AI market could generate close to $650 billion in revenue by 2030. That's bigger than the $305 billion revenue that the AI chip market is forecast to generate at the end of the decade, indicating that Microsoft is sitting on a much bigger AI opportunity than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, however, is just one of the many AI-related catalysts for Microsoft. For instance, the adoption of AI-enabled PCs could give Microsoft's growth a big boost in the future. According to market research firm Canalys, shipments of AI-capable PCs are expected to increase at an annual rate of 44% through 2028, hitting 205 million units at the end of the forecast period.\n\nMicrosoft is looking to capitalize on this opportunity with Copilot Pro, a subscription service priced at $20 a month that will give PC users access to AI tools in multiple applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint, enabling them to create images with generative AI prompts and gain priority access to popular LLMs. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the market for specialized generative AI assistants could be worth $89 billion in 2032 as compared to just $447 million in 2022, which means that Microsoft's move to monetize its Copilot could help the company reap rich rewards.\n\nSo, even though Microsoft may not be matching Nvidia's stellar growth rate right now, it seems capable of delivering steady growth for a long time to come thanks to the growing AI adoption in multiple end markets that could turn out to be more lucrative than the AI chip space.\n\nThe good part is that Microsoft's growth rate is picking up nicely following the advent of AI. That's why investors will do well to buy this stock as it is trading at a reasonable 38 times trailing earnings right now compared to Nvidia's rich price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nDigital advertising is another industry that's expected to benefit from AI adoption, with advertisers using the technology to improve audience targeting so that they can enhance their returns on ad dollars spent. Bloomberg is forecasting generative AI-based ad spending to jump to $192 billion in 2032 from only $57 million in 2022.\n\nMeta Platforms is a top way to play this opportunity thanks to the growing popularity of the company's AI-focused tools and a huge user base. The company has been rolling out generative AI features for advertisers since last year and is claiming that they are driving solid improvements in advertisers' returns.\n\nMore importantly, the company is looking to push the envelope with new initiatives such as deploying its Meta AI chatbot to popular platforms such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which will bring its AI tools to a much larger user base. Meta AI is a generative AI assistant that answers users' queries and also allows them to create images with text prompts. Given that Meta ended 2023 with almost 4 billion monthly active users across its various apps, the company is sitting on a terrific monetization opportunity.\n\nAll this explains why consensus estimates are predicting an acceleration in Meta's earnings growth to an annual rate of 26% over the next five years as compared to 10% a year in the previous five years. Meta can sustain such healthy earnings growth for a longer period considering the multibillion-dollar opportunities in digital advertising and generative AI assistants.\n\nThis is precisely the reason why buying Meta Platforms stock is a no-brainer right now. It is trading at just 25 times forward earnings as compared to a trailing P/E ratio of 35, which points toward robust bottom-line growth. Also, this AI stock is cheaper than the likes of Nvidia and is trading at a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward P/E ratio of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), giving investors all the more reason to buy Meta Platforms as AI could send this stock soaring for a long time to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc.

Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism. Although the demand environment remains challenging globally, particularly in the Express segment, the company is delivering solid earnings growth driven by cost savings initiatives. FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\n\n10.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has proven its ability to drive growth for investors' portfolios. It soared to $3 trillion in market value back in 2021, and after a slump over the past couple of years, it's once again on the rise. As investors look ahead to the possibility of lower interest rates and a stronger economy, they're returning to growth investments like crypto.\n\nBut if you prefer to stick with the stock market, don't worry -- you won't miss out on major growth opportunities. In fact, certain stocks have even more potential than any crypto right now. You'll find many of them in another hot growth area: the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI market is forecast to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and today, investors are positioning their portfolios to benefit. Let's take a closer look at three AI stocks that could beat any crypto player. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares already have soared in the triple digits over the past year, but this top AI stock still may have plenty of room to run. Here's why. Nvidia is the AI chip market leader, with 80% share, and it's likely to maintain this leadership thanks to its brand strength and constant innovation.\n\nCompanies know they can count on Nvidia, making it their go-to destination, so if Nvidia can keep ahead of rivals from a technology perspective it's likely to win. For example, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk recently said, \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI.\" This comment was in conjunction with Nvidia's announcement of its Blackwell architecture, featuring a number of innovations including the most powerful AI chip yet.\n\nThis upcoming launch, along with Nvidia's increasing spending on research and development, are reasons to be confident about the company's earnings potential. And speaking of earnings, Nvidia's dominance so far helped it report triple-digit gains in revenue and net income last year.\n\nAll of this means the stock looks like a great buy at 34 times forward earnings estimates and has plenty of fuel to advance over time.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nYou probably know Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) best thanks to its biggest revenue driver: Google Search. Advertisers pay to promote their products or services across the search platform, knowing they can easily reach their audience there. After all, Google Search consistently holds more than 90% of the global search market.\n\nThanks to AI, Google Search is likely to get better and better -- and AI tools are making the advertising experience easier for advertisers too. Alphabet recently launched its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 1.5, and is applying the technology across its business. In search, generative AI is offering users faster results and access to more information on a specific topic. This should keep users coming back, and as a result, advertisers are likely to keep spending on Google Search ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also could become an AI winner through its cloud business. Google Cloud offers clients access to AI chips and other products and services to power their AI projects. Just last year, it announced thousands of product advancements thanks to AI, and all of this helped Google Cloud win or expand deals with major companies including McDonald's and Verizon.\n\nRight now, Alphabet stock trades for 23 times forward earnings estimates, a terrific entry point for this solid long-term player.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another company that generates most of its revenue through advertising. Advertisers flock to Meta's social media platforms -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- because they know that's where they can reach us. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every day.\n\nThis has offered Meta a growing stream of revenue, which has led to profit too. Now, Meta is going all in on AI, with the plan of using this technology across all of its products and services well into the future. Meta's made AI its investment focus, with the goal of having 600,000 graphics processing units on board by the end of the year.\n\nMeta already has developed its own large language model (LLM), Llama, and is now training Llama 3. This serves as the foundation for products such as new conversational assistant Meta AI -- and thanks to Meta's open-source policy, its software could even become an industry standard.\n\nThis tech giant has huge AI ambitions, and if it even reaches only some of its goals, it could be a major AI winner -- that's why it looks like a top bargain now at 24 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 18, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Performance Food Group PFGC, Wingstop WING, Meta Platforms META and Arista Networks ANET.\n\n4 Best Stocks to Invest In for Solid Earnings Growth\n\nIf a start-up or renowned company doesn’t make money, it won’t last long. Therefore, earnings growth is the highest priority for any organization.\n\nSo, what is earnings growth? Study a company’s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a significant role.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nHere are the top four stocks that stand out:\n\nPerformance Food Group markets and distributes food and food-related products. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. PFGC’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWingstop franchises and operates restaurants. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. WING’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is almost 21%.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. META’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is nearly 35%.\n\nArista Networks is engaged in providing cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments. The company has a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), one stock that is absolutely hard to ignore is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company almost single-handedly kicked off the AI revolution by developing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make AI possible. The results of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) help illustrate its uncontested success. Revenue of $61 billion soared 126% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 surged 586%.\n\nI have no doubts that Nvidia will continue to succeed, but others have doubts. The potential for cyclicality in the chip industry, a frothy valuation, and rising fears of competition have some investors looking for viable alternatives, and following the example of a successful money manager might provide ideas.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb made his bones as the CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. From seed capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb spun that into a financial empire worth $6.6 billion. He's made no secret about his feelings regarding AI, which he views as \"transformational,\" and believes a \"profound economic upheaval\" is under way. While there are many stocks that will reap the benefits of generative AI, a quick look at Third Point's holdings reveals three that have the Loeb seal of approval -- and none of them are named Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Microsoft -- 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) deserves at least partial credit for helping to spark the AI revolution by integrating AI across a wide range of its cloud and software offerings. There's perhaps no bigger potential opportunity for the company than that represented by Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of tools that help automate and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks, thereby boosting productivity. According to Microsoft, demand has been off the charts and users seem to love it.\n\nLoeb has been incredibly bullish and has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed about 9% of its position in Microsoft in Q4, even as the value of the position rose -- thanks in part to the stock's 19% gains during the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a modest premium at 34 times earnings, but the company has only just begun to reap the rewards of its AI strategy, and Loeb obviously believes it's worth every penny -- and so do I.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb has been a firm believer in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which he first invested in years ago. He provided insight into his thinking in early 2022. At the time, the company's market cap clocked in at $1.6 trillion, and Loeb opined that the company had $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He estimated that the e-commerce segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- its cloud infrastructure segment -- was worth another $1.5 trillion. For context, Amazon's current market cap is $1.9 trillion, so there's still significant upside ahead.\n\nLoeb believes the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of generative AI is that there will be \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" in order to tap the large language models that underpin AI -- including those offered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He called cloud services the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold'.\"\n\nLoeb also trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% but, like Microsoft, the total value of his stake actually rose, thanks to a 20% increase in Amazon's stock price in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times sales to close out 2023, Amazon was, and still is, attractively priced.\n\nArtificial Intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.2% of holdings\n\nLoeb's substantial position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is at least partially explained by the ongoing rebound in the digital advertising market, but the company also has a sizable opportunity when it comes to AI. Loeb initiated a position in Q3 and added to it in Q4. Meta has long employed AI to serve relevant content to its social media users and to more accurately target the advertising that provides the lion's share of its revenue.\n\nMore recently, Meta has unveiled the next generation of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available for hire on all the major cloud infrastructure services. While we don't yet know the significance of its impact on Meta's bottom line, it does represent a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nWhile Loeb has been mum about his rationale, Meta meets Loeb's criteria of investing in \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations.\" And, as the sun set on 2023, Meta Platforms stock was selling for just 24 times earnings, a discount to a multiple of 26 for the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off.\n\n“We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.”\n\nBut generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nMeta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter.\n\nStrap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks.\n\nGenerative AI takes center stage again\n\nThe generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. Microsoft will report earnings on April 25 as investors wait to learn more about how the company is monetizing its AI strategy. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n“We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year-to-date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That’s sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nBut the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform.\n\n“You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia will relinquish its lead in the market anytime soon. It’s still miles ahead of rivals AMD and Intel in terms of market share, and it just debuted its Blackwell architecture during its GTC developer conference in March, which should put it even further ahead. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about processing units during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., on March 18. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“They still have a commanding lead and share, and their influence is huge, and they are not slowing down, to their credit,” O’Donnell said. “But the law of big numbers starts to kick in at a certain point.”\n\nThen there are the hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google. While they’ve been riding the AI hype train, many of their generative AI software offerings are still in the works, meaning it’s a bit early to get a full read on overall uptake among enterprise and consumer customers. Still, Wall Street will likely be looking for at least some revenue growth from the companies’ AI investments.\n\n“How much is AI driving [Microsoft’s] Azure? How much is AI driving Google Cloud growth? How much is it continuing to help AWS which has sort of seen its numbers slow,” said Newman.\n\nIn its last quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to its Azure revenue, up from 3 percentage points in the prior quarter. And you can bet analysts will be looking to see if the company can keep that kind of growth up in the current quarter.\n\nAmazon also pointed to AI as a growth catalyst during its last earnings call, saying revenue was \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers showed interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see if the company provides any more context around that acceleration in its upcoming earnings call. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O annual developer conference at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, Calif., on May 10, 2023. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle, like Microsoft, will also likely face questions about sales of its AI-enhanced productivity suite and how customers are responding. The company, which will host its I/O developer conference in May, has also faced controversy over its AI rollout, pulling back its Gemini AI generator after it generated historically inaccurate images.\n\nApple on deck\n\nApple’s earnings will also be a hot ticket but don’t expect the company to reveal anything about its future generative AI plans.\n\n“Apple needs to disclose something, but the company has never really been in a hurry to pacify industry investors,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think they're going to wait until WWDC in a couple of months to bring that out.”\n\nOutside of AI, investors are eagerly anticipating Apple’s iPhone revenue numbers and commentary on its lawsuits. On Monday, market intelligence firm IDC reported that global iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the current quarter. That could have a significant impact on Apple’s overall revenue.\n\nSales in China are also a problem for the company. Apple reported revenue in its third-largest market declined 13% in the prior quarter. That, coupled with falling iPhone shipments, could spell trouble for the company’s earnings.\n\nDespite those headwinds, however, there could be a bright spot. According to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple should report double-digit growth in its Services segment, which could help buoy overall sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe company’s upcoming earrings will also give investors their first glimpse into Vision Pro sales, which should offer some insight into early consumer and enterprise interest in the AR/VR headset.\n\nDigital advertising sales on the rise\n\nMeta and Google will also be on deck to show whether they can keep up the momentum in the digital advertising market. In the prior quarter, Meta’s ad sales jumped 24%, while Google’s ad sales, including YouTube ads, increased 11%.\n\nAmazon, which has built its own impressive advertising business, could also see continued ad sales growth. In the prior quarter, the company reported advertising revenue of $14.7 billion, up 27% year over year. Another performance like that could provide a nice boost to the company’s bottom line.\n\nAnalysts will also be on the lookout to see if AI is impacting advertising sales.\n\n“Theoretically, targeting should be better by using AI even with the deprecation of the cookie, but we haven't seen that yet,” Moorhead said. “To me, the evidence that I would have to see is a higher cost per click or a better CPM.”\n\nWe’ll find out all of that and more when Big Tech earnings kick off next week.

        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) shares have skyrocketed 130% in the last year and 40% YTD heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on April 24.\n\nWall Street is in love with Meta again because of its commitment to efficiency and profits—it even started paying a dividend—along with the fact it reaches roughly half of the global population.\n\nMeta’s Bull Case\n\nRising rates and Wall Street’s huge pushback on its metaverse bet forced Mark Zuckerberg to quickly pivot to its core competencies, cut costs, and focus on the bottom line.\n\nMeta’s various apps serve different pockets of social media and digital communication. The firm stands to benefit from digital advertising spending in a world of smartphone addicts. The owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp grew its daily active users by 8% in Q4 to 3.19 billion, with monthly users up 6% to 3.98 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOn top of reaching half of the globe, Meta is investing in its AI future, recently introducing its own new generation of AI chips to compete alongside the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) and others. Plus, Meta could benefit from an entirely new lane of growth if its metaverse dreams becomes a reality down the road.\n\nOther Fundamentals\n\nMeta is a digital advertising titan, dwarfing its competitors such as Snap and Pinterest. Meta’s revenue is projected to jump 18% in FY24 and 13% next year to $180 billion (up from $135 billion in 2023).\n\nMeta is projected to grow its adjusted EPS by 35% in FY24 and 16% in FY25, following 73% earnings expansion in 2023. Its Zacks consensus estimates for FY24 and FY25 earnings have surged 38% over the past 12 months and Meta crushed our estimates in the trailing four quarters.\n\nThe tech giant’s balance sheet is stellar, helping it pursue new growth areas such as AI. Meta confirmed its commitment to shareholders earlier this year when it initiated a quarterly dividend. Wall Street is very high on the stock, with 40 of the 46 brokerage recommendations that Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta stock has soared 125% in the last year and 450% off its 2022 lows, including a 40% YTD surge. The stock has pulled back off its early April records, slipping below its 50-day moving average recently for the first time this year alongside the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Meta might face selling pressure down to its 200-day or 21-week moving averages. But it has already cooled off from heavily overbought RSI levels to below neutral.\n\nDespite its rebound and its 735% climb in the last 10 years to easily double Tech, its valuation is impressive. Meta trades at an 8% discount to the Zacks tech sector and 60% below its highs at 23.8X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meta’s recent cooldown alongside the market makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather potential near-term volatility.\n\nOthers might want to wait until after Meta reports or a larger pullback, though the market-timing game is notoriously difficult.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Stocks the Hedge Fund Gurus Are Piling Into: April 2024",
        "content": "With a lot of uncertainty in the market from geopolitics down to monetary policy, jittery investors may find comfort in hedge fund picks. Specifically, ideas that the alpha wolves of the market have put their money into may offer both confidence and upside.\n\nWhen I think about this theme, I can’t help but recall the film “Wall Street” (the original one). The antihero of the movie, Gordon Gekko, remarks that he hates losses. Instead, he prefers sure things, which eventually moves the narrative forward (I won’t give it away). And that’s why hedge fund picks are intriguing – these institutions hate losses.\n\nOf course, the risk factor is that these entities can often absorb the consequences of their mistakes. You, on the other hand, might not be able to. So, take these ideas with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for high-success-probability ideas, the below hedge fund picks may be a good place to start.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoftware and technology hardware giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have a reputation for being boring. However, boring appears to be gold in this environment. According to HedgeFollow, major institutions have acquired $40.83 billion worth of MSFT stock based on 13F filings in the fourth quarter of last year. The biggest player is Vanguard Group, which acquired $5.43 billion worth of shares.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why the big dogs appreciate Microsoft – it’s consistent. In the last fiscal year, the company’s positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%. Its best performance in 2023 was in the third quarter, posting earnings per share of $2.73. This print beat out the estimate of earnings of $2.42 per share.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $11.64. That’s well above last year’s result of $9.81 EPS. Further, revenue may clock in at $244.22 billion, 15.2% above last year’s tally of $211.91 billion. With its investments in artificial intelligence, Microsoft could easily reach these targets. It’s one of the hedge fund picks to consider.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be a predictable idea among hedge fund picks, it’s also a compelling one. Fundamentally, e-commerce transactions as a share of total retail sales continue to rise since Q2 2022. That’s encouraging for AMZN stock amid all the inflation concerns. Not surprisingly, then, the major institutions have picked up on this development, buying up $24.1 billion worth of AMZN shares in Q4.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft above, investors appreciate Amazon for its consistency. What makes the company stand out, though, is the high baseline. It’s not just that Amazon beat its bottom-line targets last year. Rather, the average positive earnings surprise landed at 55.15%. That’s extremely impressive, even for a hot tech player.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS of $4.13. That’s well above last year’s tally of $2.90. Further, they’re looking for revenue to hit $641.35 billion or 11.6% up from 2023’s result of $574.78 billion. Combined with a unanimous strong buy rating (among 41 expert voices), AMZN is one of the hedge fund picks to add to your portfolio.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it might not get the spotlight like some other tech players, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is vital to the overall ecosystem. As a designer, developer and supplier of various semiconductor devices, it plays an indispensable role in the innovation industry. Therefore, it’s not surprising that it’s one of the favorites among hedge fund picks. In the final quarter of 2023, major entities bought just over $16 billion worth of AVGO stock.\n\nAs with the other ideas on this list, Broadcom benefits from consistency. In fiscal 2023, the company beat all its bottom-line targets. Its average positive earnings surprise came out to a decent 2.8%. Its best performance last year came in Q4, when it delivered EPS of $10.99. In contrast, experts were anticipating EPS of $10.29.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts believe Broadcom will post earnings of $46.91 per share. That’s a significant boost from last year’s result of $42.25 EPS. Not only that, the average revenue target stands at $50.35 billion, up 40.6% from last year’s haul of $35.82 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAs an internet technology giant among other specialties, it’s no surprise that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks highly among hedge fund picks. You really can’t do much these days without Alphabet’s myriad services. For example, even if you don’t use the company’s Gmail system, you’re more than likely using Google to conduct searches. With that, hedge funds have put in $14.81 billion in GOOGL stock in Q4 last year.\n\nThis figure should only rise in the years ahead. As a well-established business, Alphabet probably isn’t going to make prospective investors rich. However, it should be a stable anchor during rough waters. Last year, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in Q1, producing a positive surprise of 9.3%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are hoping for the tech firm to post EPS of $6.82. That’s a big boost from $5.80, though it seems reasonable given the historical performance. Also, revenue could soar to $342.35 billion, up 11.4% from last year. Combined with a strong buy consensus view, GOOGL is one of the top hedge fund picks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting life as a social media network called Facebook – you may have heard of it – Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has branched out into other avenues. Right now, it’s focused on the metaverse, which represents the next wave of connectivity. While many experts have questions about this directive, Meta’s sales of related hardware – such virtual reality headsets – offer upside potential.\n\nAs such, the big dogs have invested $14.08 billion into META stock in the final quarter of 2023. With the company announcing a dividend, it could attract more institutional players. Financially, the benefit of owning META comes down to robust performances. Last year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 10%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $20.03. That’s a huge jump from last year’s print of earnings of $14.87 per share. Also, experts believe Meta will keep on expanding, delivering sales of $158.39 billion. That’s up 17.4% from the prior year. With so many positives, META ranks as one of the top-tier hedge fund picks.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA simultaneously risky but compelling idea, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) shows that the big dogs like to speculate at times too. What makes UBER a tough idea for hedge fund picks is the question mark hanging over discretionary consumer sentiment. People are looking to save money during this juncture, especially with inflation possibly about to worsen.\n\nOn the other hand, UBER makes for an intriguing idea because of its travel implications. According to Deloitte, the phenomenon known as revenge traveling might have come to an end. Nevertheless, people are still prioritizing destinations and experiences. If that continues to hold, Uber could be an enticing speculative bet. Sure enough, institutional investors bought up $10.84 billion worth of UBER stock.\n\nNotably, the experts are excited about the ride-sharing specialist too. For the current fiscal year, they’re projecting EPS to land at $1.36. That’s noticeably above last year’s print of 87 cents. Also, revenue could clock in at $43.32 billion, up 16.2% from 2023. Even better, fiscal 2025 sales could hit $50.42 billion.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt this moment, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) may be an investment that sells itself. Yes, the geopolitical backdrop presents volatility risks for all sectors, including the crude oil space. However, the world continues to run on oil. So, if global tensions – already simmering from recent actions – spiral out of control, supply chains could be disrupted.\n\nCynically, this dynamic could be a positive for XOM in terms of sales and profits. Even if blistering costs hurt the wallet, economies just can’t stop moving altogether. And because hydrocarbons represent a critical commodity, both people and institutions will find a way to pay. With that in mind, it’s not shocking that hedge funds acquired $9.42 billion worth of XOM stock.\n\nWith the recent market dip, the institutional players could acquire even more shares. To be sure, the average consensus view of $9.27 EPS on sales of $334.88 billion imply a top-and-bottom-line decrease from last year’s results. Still, given the latest reality, the high-side estimate of $11.08 EPS on sales of $384.24 billion could be in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "‘Meta is out of options’: EU regulators reject its privacy fee for Facebook and Instagram",
        "content": "It looks like Meta’s strategy of charging European Facebook and Instagram users, for the privilege of not being tracked for ad-targeting purposes, ain’t gonna fly.\n\nMeta introduced the subscriptions late last year in an attempt to grapple with the implications of a bombshell July ruling by the EU’s highest court, which found that Meta had no legal basis for tracking its users across its services and third-party sites unless it got their express consent to do so. But privacy advocates swiftly complained, arguing that it’s not real consent if the only alternative is shelling out yet another monthly subscription fee—originally as much as €12.99 ($13.82) for an account used on both mobile and the web, before Meta last month proposed a drop to €5.99 as a way of mollifying its critics.\n\nToday, Politico first reported that the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)—the umbrella organization for the EU’s various privacy regulators—had decided that the privacy advocates complaining about what they derisively called Meta’s “pay or okay” model had a point.\n\n“In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee,” the EDPB said in its opinion, published later in the day.\n\nEDPB Chair Anu Talus said platforms “should give users a real choice when employing ‘consent or pay’ models,” adding: “The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay. As a result most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices.”\n\n“Overall, Meta is out of options in the EU,” said Max Schrems, the Austrian activist lawyer whose 13-year legal crusade against Meta is what gradually removedthoseoptions, in a statement. “It must now give users a genuine yes/no option for personalized advertising. It can still charge pages for reach, engage in contextual ads and alike—but tracking people for ads needs a clear ‘yes’ by users.”\n\nMeta has tried using various legal justifications for scooping up and processing European users’ personal data over the years since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018—with each being successively shot down by regulators as being an unacceptable reading of the privacy law. First Meta claimed that this tracking was part of its user contract, then that it had a “legitimate interest” in conducting targeted advertising, and now that it’s getting genuine consent from those who choose to avoid the new fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSchrems claimed that the introduction of subscription fees as the alternative increased the proportion of people agreeing to be tracked from 3% to over 90%. “You don’t need a lawyer to see that it’s not ‘freely given’ consent,” he said. “In fact, five years after the GDPR came into force, this is just the latest ‘trick’ to undermine EU law or at least delay compliance for a few more years.”\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nIn other European regulatory news, Apple’s latest beta version of iOS makes it possible for EU iPhone users to directly download apps from developers’ websites, rather than having to use an app store. Originally reported by MacRumors, that is part of Apple’s tortuous journey toward compliance with the new Digital Markets Act, a blockbuster antitrust law. There are conditions, though, including Apple’s insistence that apps can only be eligible if they’ve already had at least a million first installs on iOS in the EU, in the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission is miffed that TikTok launched a new “TikTok Lite” app in France and Spain before conducting a legally required risk assessment about its potential impact on young people’s mental health, in particular “potential stimulation of addictive behavior,” Reuters reports. The app, which is supposed to be for over-18s, rewards its use with points that can be exchanged for Amazon vouchers and the like. TikTok—which the Commission is already formally investigating under the new online-content law known as the Digital Services Act—now has all of one day to submit that risk assessment.

        "title": "Opinion: These Will Be the 4 Largest Companies by 2035",
        "content": "Just 11 years ago, Apple, ExxonMobil, Alphabet, and Berkshire Hathaway were the four largest American companies. Today, only two of those companies -- Apple and Alphabet -- remain in the top four. Berkshire Hathaway has slipped to No. 7, and ExxonMobil and Walmart have fallen from the top 10 altogether.\n\nA lot can change in only 11 years. Let's look at the companies I believe will claim the top four spots in 2035. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nBy 2035, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will be the world's largest company by market cap. What's more, I think it could happen even sooner.\n\nOne reason is that Nvidia has already grown faster than nearly anyone expected. The company's market cap has exploded almost 10x, from $0.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion in less than two years. NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nThe massive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is behind the company's rapid rise. Thanks to its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia is well-positioned to take the crown as the largest company by 2035 -- if not sooner. That's because the GPU market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. According to Global Markets Insights, the size of the GPU market is set to expand from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2032.\n\nWhat's more, the ramp in GPU spending is already here. Nvidia's sales increased by a mind-blowing 265% year over year in its most recent quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28, 2024). While sales are expected to cool somewhat, analysts still expect the company to grow them by 82% this year.\n\nOver the next five years, given the explosive growth of the overall GPU market, analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 37% per year, meaning the company's annual revenue by 2030 could approach $300 billion.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is riding a tsunami of growth that could carry it all the way to the top spot by 2035.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.2 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's largest company, having passed Apple last year.\n\nLike Nvidia, the AI revolution has lifted Microsoft's market cap significantly. The company's extensive and iconic software suite offers a natural home for AI-powered tools, and it has wasted no time integrating AI features into its software.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft enjoys a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That partnership has already helped both companies and puts Microsoft in a good spot to benefit from future AI breakthroughs that OpenAI may make. AI will likely be the key factor in driving market caps higher over the next decade, and Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of growth, analysts expect Microsoft to grow sales by 16% per year over the next five years, implying annual sales of over $475 billion by 2030. That's nearly in line with an internal target set by chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella of $500 billion in revenue by 2030. Either way, Microsoft's expected growth shows that the company has staying power, and while the company may not be able to stay ahead of Nvidia, it will likely keep its lead over everyone else.\n\nAmazon\n\nWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is currently America's fifth-largest company. But by 2035, I see it leapfrogging a number of companies, including Apple and Alphabet, to take the third spot.\n\nThat's because Amazon, like Nvidia and Microsoft before it, has a natural way to benefit from the AI revolution. The company already utilizes more than 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouses. They measure and pack products, move heavy items, read labels, and distribute shelves and packages.\n\nIn addition, AI should help the company improve the digital side of its e-commerce business. AI assistants can shop for customers and help with returns. AI-powered ad tools can refine which customers see which ads, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and generating more ad revenue for Amazon. Moreover, the company's crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), should continue to benefit from the transition to the cloud over the next decade.\n\nAmazon is already one of the largest companies by revenue; the company has generated $575 billion over the last 12 months -- second only to Walmart's $648 billion. However, Amazon is closing the gap quickly and should overtake Walmart soon. Analysts expect Amazon to grow its revenue by 31% per year over the next five years, bringing annual revenue to an eye-popping $2.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nThanks to its impressive revenue growth, I think Amazon will climb the rankings up to third place.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nRounding out the top four is MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META). Currently the sixth-largest American company by market cap, I expect Meta to leapfrog both Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nMeta is quickly becoming one of the world's biggest cash cows. The company's lucrative ad business continues to grow by leaps and bounds as the digital advertising market expands. Moreover, Meta's ambitious AI research and development could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs over the next decade.\n\nIn terms of revenue, analysts expect Meta to grow revenue by 26% annually over the next five years, leading to an annual total of $429 billion by 2030.\n\nAt any rate, with its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) providing ample free cash flow, Meta is well-positioned to grow its market cap significantly over the next decade, so it could surpass laggards like Alphabet and Apple by 2035.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds Meta, advocacy group NOYB comments, details)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, April 17 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms is set to be told by the EU's privacy watchdog that it cannot charge users a fee to ensure their privacy, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMeta's no-ads subscription service, which applies to Facebook and Instagram and launched in Europe in November, requires users to pay a fee to ensure their privacy. It has prompted criticism from privacy activists and consumer groups.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant referred on Wednesday to its previous blogs which said that 'subscription for no ads' conforms to a European Union court ruling backing such models as a way for people to consent to data processing for targeted advertising.\n\nThe European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which will publish its opinion shortly, declined to comment.\n\n\"We welcome that the EDPB has started a more nuanced discussion on 'pay or okay' and at least clarified that large platforms cannot use 'pay or okay',\" Advocacy group NOYB's chairman Max Schrems said in a statement.\n\nPolitico first reported the EDPB's opinion.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "The market expects Meta Platforms (META) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis social media company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +63.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $36.22 billion, up 26.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Meta Platforms?\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.26%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Meta Platforms will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Meta Platforms would post earnings of $4.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.33, delivering a surprise of +10.35%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMeta Platforms appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 36% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Meta Platforms'  ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n26% = US$39b ÷ US$153b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.26.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Meta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Meta Platforms has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Meta Platforms was able to see a decent net income growth of 9.4% over the last five years.\n\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.0% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for META? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Meta Platforms Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Meta Platforms' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Here Are My Top 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "There's no hotter topic in technology today than artificial intelligence (AI). Breakthroughs from ChatGPT and competing platforms have captivated both tech enthusiasts and investors. But with so many companies trying to make waves in the AI realm, investors can become exhausted trying to identify the most compelling opportunities.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia -- are the usual suspects in the AI spotlight. Below, I'll break down the three megacap tech behemoths I think are the strongest buys right now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft kicked off the AI revolution with its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI in early 2023. OpenAI is the start-up behind the wildly successful AI application ChatGPT.\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT throughout its Windows operating system. The technology has helped spear gains in the company's Azure cloud computing platform, as well as Microsoft's developer product GitHub.\n\nThe investment in OpenAI appears to be paying off in spades. It's no wonder that top tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has proclaimed that Microsoft's \"iPhone moment\" has arrived.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's ecosystem represents something bigger than just new revenue opportunities. Microsoft has transformed from a personal computing empire to a leader in cloud computing and is now evolving into a full-blown AI powerhouse.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 36, Microsoft stock isn't exactly cheap. The forward P/E of the S&P 500 is just under 21. However, the company's robust cash-flow machine and diversified business model is hard to pass over -- especially when it comes to the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMicrosoft is a top investing opportunity as the AI narrative continues to play out. Now is a great time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to add to an existing position or initiate a new one. Prepare to hold for the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAlthough Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI was the talk of the town for a while, e-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon made a splash of its own -- investing $4 billion in a competing platform called Anthropic. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon as its primary cloud provider.\n\nMoreover, the AI start-up will also be leveraging Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips to train future generative AI models. The relationship with Anthropic should serve as a bellwether to accelerate growth -- particularly in the cloud computing arena.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Amazon's $36.8 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow and $86 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, it's no wonder that both Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett own the stock. The company has a tremendous level of financial flexibility and is in a unique position to invest in many areas across the AI realm.\n\nTrading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 3.4, Amazon stock looks attractive, compared to historical valuation levels. Moreover, it's the lowest-valued stock in the Magnificent Seven, based on this metric. Currently, there's an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares in Amazon as its breakthroughs in AI continue to unfold. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nThe last Magnificent Seven company I'll be exploring is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms, which dominates the social media realm through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the company is also making inroads in gaming through its popular virtual reality (VR) business Meta Quest.\n\n2023 was a key year for Meta. The company spent much of it using a series of layoffs to right-size its expense profile and shift its focus to accelerated profit margins. While Meta grew its top line by 16% last year, its operating income soared by 62%. The newfound margin expansion flowed directly to the bottom line, as net income increased 69% year over year.\n\nWith $43 billion of free cash flow, Meta has found no shortage of ways to reinvest in the business. The company increased its share-buyback program by $50 billion and announced a quarterly dividend.\n\nOn top of that, Meta is making impressive inroads in the AI space. The company is building its own chips to compete with industry titan Nvidia. Moreover, by combining these chips with its existing library of data from its various social media platforms, Meta is uniquely positioned to ignite a new phase of growth for its core advertising operation.\n\nAlthough its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.3 is a bit pricey compared to peers, I see the premium as warranted. Meta is a cash machine and has found ways to reward shareholders while also aggressively pursuing AI, the next frontier in technology at large.\n\nThere's currently a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares in Meta and benefit from the passive-income opportunity from the dividend, while also keeping a close eye on the company's further progress in AI.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast Amid High Inflation: 5 Picks",
        "content": "On Apr 16, the International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast for 2023 to 3.2% from 3.1% in January. More importantly, the agency projected that global growth will remain static at 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025 despite elevated inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe IMF projected that the global headline inflation will decline gradually from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. However, the average global growth rate for the next five years will be 3.1%, marking the lowest medium-term growth forecast in decades.\n\nIMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas urged central bankers to be on track to bring down the inflation rate to their respective target levels. According to Gourinchas, “As the global economy approaches a soft landing, the near-term priority for central banks is to ensure that inflation touches down smoothly, by neither easing policies prematurely nor delaying too long and causing target undershoots.”\n\nThe IMF said that the U.S. economy will remain resilient and is likely to grow at 2.7% annually in 2024 after growing 2.5% in 2023. However, the GDP growth rate is expected to converge to the pre-pandemic level of 1.9% in 2025.\n\nOn Apr 16, speaking to a policy forum focused on U.S.-Canada economic relations, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy remains strong and the inflation rate has failed to reduce to the level expected by the Fed. For that, the central bank is compelled to keep a higher interest rate for a longer period.\n\nThe Fed fund rate is at its 23-year high in the range of 5.25-5.5%. In late February, the CME FedWatch tool showed a nearly 80% probability of the first rate cut in June. At present, that probability is a mere 13%. The majority of market participants are now anticipating the first rate cut to happen in September.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital >$100 billion) as these companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have popped more than 25% year to date with strong potential left for 2024. Further, these stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 73.8% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025).

        "content": "This year, VR stocks are becoming more popular. But not everyone can afford to invest in the industry leader, Meta (NASDAQ:META), which is expected to rise 44% in 2024 due to indicators of a recovering digital advertising market.\n\nMeta capitalized on the resumption of advertising income after unsettling 2022 and 2023. After plunging to a low in 2022, META shares have recovered by doubling its earnings in Q4 of 23 and paying out its first dividend.\n\nBut one thing that appears to be lost on everyone is its metaverse business, which has lost around $50 billion. Here, Meta is going all in, and it can afford to lose.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo take advantage of a potentially $259 billion industry, investors would be better served by looking at three VR stocks that promise more than double-digit upside and each have their own distinct use case — whether it be via consortium blockchain solutions or accurate 3D copies.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR), a global leader in the digital twin and metaverse sectors, is underperforming in 2024 and has lost 28% of its market value.\n\nBut because of the Covid-19 pandemic, MTTR’s groundbreaking work with digital twins and accurate 3D replicas of real places could make a comeback possible.\n\nIt’s hard to value these two new categories. Fortune Business Insights expects the global digital twin market to grow 40% from $18 billion in 2024 to $259 billion in 2032. Polaris Market Research predicts the global metaverse market would reach $60 billion in 2022 and grow 41%.\n\nSeveral Fortune 1000 companies trust the firm’s technology. The relationship with Meta Platforms to produce digital twins for AI research shows Matterport’s technology’s importance to metaverse infrastructure.\n\nMatterport’s Winter 2024 Release included AI-powered Property Intelligence upgrades. This feature package automates property measurements, layouts, editing and reporting from a Matterport digital twin to modernize property analytics.\n\nThe 2024 release includes Minimap, Compass, Business Card and Quick Link Showcase Plugins to facilitate digital twin navigation and interaction.\n\nMatterport’s schematic floor plans now include color, branding, languages and furniture on/off. New tools eliminate site visits and provide more detailed house blueprints to attract qualified purchasers.\n\nIn addition, Matterport has launched Project Genesis, a generative AI platform that employs digital twins to develop property designs to transform property management autonomously.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project a 119% upside based on a $4 target price.\n\nWiMi Hologram Cloud (WIMI) hologram of the earth being touched by a hand\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nWiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ:WIMI) has created a lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing solution using consortium blockchains to enhance data sharing across many industries.\n\nIts blockchain for AR and holographic eye-tracking focusing technology advances demonstrate its industry leadership in the global AR and VR market, which Statista expects to grow 10.77% (2024-2028) to $58.1 billion by 2028.\n\nWiMi’s focus on vehicle HUDs, education and healthcare suggests market growth in its future. Also, WiMi’s strategic partnerships and expansions position it for market share and revenue growth.\n\nThe company has introduced a weighted PBFT algorithm to increase throughput and efficiency. It optimizes blockchain cross-chain consensus for throughput, latency and fault tolerance.\n\nIn addition, WiMi’s innovative eye-tracking technology uses spatial light modulators to adjust focus rapidly without mechanical components, improving user comfort and device stability.\n\nThe eye-tracking WiMi HoloAR Lens creates immersive and customized experiences in consumer and professional industries like healthcare and education.\n\nFinally, last trading for 68 cents, the stock offers a massive upside with a $7 price target.\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHimax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is down over 18% this year despite recording an earnings beat of 171% in Q4’23.\n\nBut its significance in the production of semiconductors and display drivers is undervalued, which makes it a dark horse among VR stocks.\n\nHimax’s innovative AI processing technologies might draw in investors who are looking for low-cost tech startups.\n\nIts semiconductor solutions process images on displays in consumer electronics. Additionally, thanks to its ultra-bright front-side color Sequence LCoS Microdisplay, Himax is a major player in the augmented reality eyewear market.\n\nIn the future, Himax’s ultralow-power contactless palm vein authentication technology, WiseEye Vein, will make its debut at ISC West 2024. a piece of their battery-operated endpoint WiseEye AI series.\n\nMoreover, Himax will also debut agile 3D sensing and ultra-luminous Color Sequential Front-Lit LCoS microdisplay at CES 2024. These boost color and brightness for immersive AR.\n\nIn an effort to highlight developments in touch technology and display quality, Himax will also reveal its In-Cell TDDI for LCD notebooks and an On-Cell touch controller for premium AMOLED notebooks at CES 2024.\n\nIncidentally, HIMX stock’s consensus target price is also $7, translating into a 37% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "You don’t always have to find small hidden gems to outperform the stock market. Buying shares of reliable corporations can help you outpace the stock market. Blue-chip stocks tend to be more persistent during market volatility and can limit your losses. These same stocks have great potential during bullish economic cycles.\n\nInvestors should look at a company’s profit margins, financial growth and business opportunities before investing in a stock. Those factors can set some corporations apart and reward long-term investors. If you’re looking for blue-chip behemoths with large market caps, you may want to consider these top picks.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a reliable fintech company that will be around for many years as people continue to use their credit and debit cards.

The yield is only 0.57%, but the growth rate is promising for long-term investors. Mastercard has maintained an annualized growth rate of 17.02% over the past five years.

The fifth one maintains its position as a top provider thanks to its strategic approach to broadband connections, which uses fixed and wireless technology. The sixth demonstrates flexibility and development potential through diversification initiatives and success in new areas.\n\nLastly, the seventh operational accomplishment highlights its dedication to strategic efforts, especially in the healthcare sector. This results in favorable financial consequences. Read more to learn about the fundamentals behind its rapid value growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has executed its post-merger integration. It saves $4 billion between merger and transformation costs, demonstrating its dedication to cost reduction and operational effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, the integration initiatives make the company more flexible and streamlined. This has allowed Warner Bros. Discovery to realize further economies in production flow and enterprise systems, which helps to increase cash flow generation and profitability.\n\nFurther, Warner Bros. Discovery’s direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector has nearly 98 million members (Q4 2023). This indicates tremendous growth potential. The company is still focused on growing its direct-to-consumer (D2C) product line. Moreover, the company plans to introduce Max to important foreign markets, including Europe and Latin America.\n\nOverall, the D2C segment has the potential for profitability and contribution to overall performance. Hence, this is reflected in the company’s positive EBITDA of almost $100 million.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q4 2023 and 2023, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) delivered constant top-line growth. The company has the fundamental capacity to seize a higher portion of the digital payments industry. Revenue climbed by 9% in Q4 and by 8% in 2023. Additionally, PayPal attained a revenue boost on both a spot and a neutral foreign exchange basis. This signifies its adaptability to a range of market situations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, PayPal’s total payment volume (TPV) was $409.8 billion in Q4 and $1.53 trillion in 2023. This was boosted by 15% in Q4 and 13% in 2023 on a spot basis. It is a core factor deriving the company’s top-line growth. The steady increase in TPV reflects PayPal’s capacity to handle rising transaction volumes, which reflects the company’s growing user base and strengthening relationships with current clients.\n\nFinally, alongside the focus on cost control, there is a sharp effort to make strategic investments in high-growth sectors like Braintree, branded checkout, and other value-added services. Thus, by making these investments, PayPal may improve its competitive edge while preserving an efficient balance between expense reduction and top-line growth.\n\nMeta (META) A woman holds Apple iPhone X with Instagram application on the screen at cafe.

META stock, Instagram layoffs\n\nSource: wichayada suwanachun / Shutterstock.com\n\nFacebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and other applications in Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) family of apps have billions of users. Moreover, Meta’s family of Daily Active People (DAP) grew 8% over 2022 to 3.19 billion in 2023. Similarly, the family of Monthly Active People (MAP) increased to 3.98 billion. This indicates 6% annual growth, reflecting Meta’s capacity to draw and hold users across all its platforms.\n\nAbout Facebook, in particular, the platform’s daily active users (DAUs) averaged 2.11 billion in 2023. This is a 6% rise over 2022. In addition, as of 2023, Facebook’s Monthly Active Users (MAUs) had grown by 3%, demonstrating Facebook’s enduring popularity and massive user engagement.\n\nTo conclude, Meta’s secret to success is its capacity to maintain a large and continuously expanding user base on all its platforms. Hence, this broad audience base offers a solid basis for generating revenue from advertising and other forms of monetization.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith sales of over $15 billion in Q4 2023, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) holds solid top-line growth. There is a considerable boost of 10% over Q4 2022, indicating the business’s ability to seize market opportunities and satisfy client demand. Intel has demonstrated its endurance and competitiveness in the semiconductor sector by generating double-digit sales growth.\n\nAdditionally, Intel still has space for potential growth; even if it forecasts the revenue to fall modestly in Q1 2024, the company projects it at $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion. Even with the range of revenues below the 2023 Q4, Intel remains optimistic, with some guidance pointing towards the underlying strength in the main business divisions.\n\nTo sum up, Intel 3’s release reflects its technical development, the first advanced node available to Intel Foundry Services (IFS) clients. Finally, Intel’s focus on tackling the problems of semiconductor innovation is demonstrated by the installation in Oregon of the first on-site high-NA EUV tool in the industry.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location.

This demonstrates the company’s solid growth in net addition. Fios customers and fixed wireless access drove this rise, demonstrating the high demand for broadband connection options.\n\nWith more than 1.5 million net additions to Verizon’s broadband network during the year, fixed wireless access emerged as a major driver of net additions. This expansion exceeded projections and proved Verizon’s plan to use wireless technologies to increase internet coverage to be more effective.\n\nMoreover, Verizon’s Fios Internet net additions increased, reaching 248K for the year. Although this was a slight gain over the prior year, it demonstrated Verizon’s ability to draw new customers and keep existing ones for its conventional fiber-based internet services.\n\nLastly, the steady increase in broadband net additions shows Verizon’s ability to take advantage of the growing demand in urban and rural regions for high-speed internet services.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nThe growth potential of Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) has been bolstered by its strategy of broadening its product line and venturing into new areas.

Countries with dynamic off-take volume growth included Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, and others.\n\nAdditionally, with over 8.5 million adult users, the IQOS brand propelled development in the heat-not-burn sector in places like Japan. The category’s proportion of the Japanese industry grew to about 40%, demonstrating how well-accepted smokeless alternatives are.\n\nMoreover, the nicotine pouch product ZYN by Philip Morris had remarkable growth in the United States in Q4 of 2023, with volumes rising by more than 75%. Its growing retail value share reflects the product’s premium positioning and excellent brand equity.\n\nFinally, Philip Morris’ expansion was greatly aided by the acquisition of Swedish Match; pro forma net revenues increased by 20% in 2023 and 26% in Q4 of 2023. ZYN’s exceptional performance in the U.S. further enhanced Philip Morris’s income streams and market presence.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "The broad basket of social media stocks has much to gain as they seek to trim inefficiencies while investing in various growth drivers. Undoubtedly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can help many big-name social media firms better monetize their swollen user bases.\n\nAdditionally, AI seems to be the magic solution to automating less-than-efficient aspects of operations while driving forth innovative features and profitability opportunities. As AI becomes the new normal, while various firms look to enter the metaverse, social media companies must invest to stay relevant as the “spatial” medium gradually inches into our everyday lives.\n\nUndoubtedly, those chunky, often expensive headsets may remain quite niche for now. But social media firms add another dimension to their products; perhaps the headsets will gain the “killer apps” that we all seek as reasons to make the big splurge on fancy face computers!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to flex its muscles as one of the biggest and best social media stocks to buy now. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, and he’s not about to lift his foot off the pedal after driving efficiencies and making cuts to less “growthy” parts of his business.\n\nEven after Meta’s multi-year, multi-bagger run, various analysts see more room for growth as the firm looks to expand its advertising business. Ronald Josey over at Citigroup (NYSE:C) sees META stock climbing to $590.00 per share on the back of “newer ad innovations,” including Advantage+ Creative and a long-form version of its TikTok rival Reels. Such a price target entails an 18% gain from here.\n\nIn many ways, Meta stands out as one of the best that the Magnificent Seven has to offer. Whether we’re talking about the firm’s new advertising tools, its powerful AI team hard at work on next-generation models, its relatively affordable line of headsets to plug into its metaverse, and its “moaty” family of social apps, Meta has no shortage of growth levers. In the coming month, Meta will be ready to launch the latest version of its open-source AI model: LLaMA 3\n\nOver the next year, I expect the company to continue outpacing the market as it pulls all of them simultaneously.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms have seen increased business overlap in recent years.\n\nThough Alphabet doesn’t share Mark Zuckerberg’s ambition for the future of the metaverse or virtual reality, both firms are clashing for generative AI dominance. Alphabet’s Google Gemini is a capable large language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s LLaMA.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s not just AI where Alphabet will compete against Meta for market dominance. Alphabet’s YouTube platform competes against Meta’s social-media family of apps in a battle for user engagement. In the short-form video scene, YouTube Shorts and Meta Reels could take their battle to the next level if some sort of TikTok ban were implemented in the U.S.\n\nEither way, Alphabet may very well be home to the most influential social media platform. With Shorts and live streaming, it will be interesting to see how the ecosystem evolves in the age of AI-created content.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent stock TCEHY stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencentHoldings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is the social media powerhouse in China, with its dominant super-app WeChat bringing in more than 1.3 billion monthly active users as of the latest quarter. Undoubtedly, WeChat has branched out to offer a wide range of services to monetize the firm’s massive user base. From payments to gaming, WeChat is pretty much a mobile operating system within a single app.\n\nThough Tencent’s dominance puts it at risk of increased regulatory scrutiny, the firm has taken steps to ensure it’s playing by the Chinese government’s rules to avoid costly penalties and hurdles that could weigh on future growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, TCEHY shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), making it one of the cheapest mega-cap social-media titans in the world. Still, off over 61% from its all-time high, Tencent shares look like a rather untimely bargain for those hungry for exposure to the Chinese economy while it’s still in a slump.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "content": "Following two explicit, AI-generated images of female public figures on its sites, Meta’s Oversight Boardplans to look into how Facebook and Instagram address this sort of content.\n\nOne of the public figures who was the subject of the deepfake nude image was from India. The other was from the United States. Meta did not name the figures.\n\nIn the case of the Indian woman, a user reported the content to Meta, citing pornography. That report was closed as it was not reviewed within 48 hours. An appeal was made, but that was also automatically closed, meaning the image remained viewable. The user then appealed to the Oversight Board.\n\nAt that point, Meta reversed course and said the decision to leave the image up was a mistake and removed it.\n\nThe second image, of the American celebrity, showed her nude while a man groped her breasts. That image was removed promptly and added to the company’s automated enforcement system, which automatically removes images that break rules.\n\nThe board says it plans to assess whether current policies and enforcement practices are effective at addressing explicit AI images and whether the company is enforcing those practices equally around the world.\n\nDeepfakes are a fast-growing problem in general. A Channel 4 investigation in the U.K. found artificial images, many created by AI, of nearly 4,000 celebrities. And a 2019 report by the AI firm DeepTrace Labs concluded these images were overwhelmingly weaponized against women, with female actors and South Korean K-pop singers the most popular targets.\n\nIn January, a deepfake image of Taylor Swift went viral on Twitter/X, prompting the platform to block some searches for her name.\n\nMeta’s Oversight Board is seeking public comments about a number of issues, including the harms posed by deepfake nude and pornographic images, how the company can address the issue, and the problems with automated systems that automatically close appeals before reviews can take place.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Patricia Vicente Rua\n\nLISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's far-right party Chega will take legal action against Meta Platforms' decision to restrict the party's Facebook account for 10 years, a party spokesperson said on Tuesday.\n\nThe anti-immigration, populist Chega is the third-largest political party in Portugal, having quadrupled its parliamentary representation to 50 lawmakers in last month's snap election that underscored a pivot towards far-right populism in Europe.\n\nThe party said it had been informed by Meta that its account had been restricted for 3,649 days because its activity \"disrespected our community standards\".\n\n\"We're going to take legal action against this decision,\" Patricia Carvalho, a lawmaker and spokesperson for the party told Reuters, adding that Meta did not give restricted users the opportunity to appeal via the social media platform.\n\nMeta didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\n\"On Chega's Facebook page you can only share content published by other pages. We cannot create content,\" Carvalho said, calling the decision incomprehensible and an \"unprecedented persecution of a political party in Portugal\".\n\nShe declined to speculate on what may have provoked it.\n\nThe party was still posting videos and messages created by its parliamentary group's page on Tuesday.\n\nUnder Facebook's Community Standards, accounts can be restricted when there is a history of previous violations and/or the use of hate speech, incitement to violence or other policy infringements.\n\nChega's anti-immigration and anti-Roma rhetoric has in the past provoked accusations of discriminatory speech from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"This is an unacceptable form of censorship,\" the party's leader Andre Ventura wrote on social media platform X, calling on Chega supporters to show their indignation to Meta.\n\nThe party reaches many of its voters using social media. Chega's Facebook account has 199,000 followers and Ventura's TikTok account has over 280,000 followers.\n\n(Reporting by Patrícia Vicente Rua; Editing by Andrei Khalip and Ros Russell)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Fake explicit images of Taylor Swift on X in January sparked concern over online misogyny and abuse - Allison Dinner/Shutterstock\n\nMeta’s oversight board is investigating the spread of deepfake nude pictures of women and celebrities on Instagram and Facebook, weeks after explicit fake images of singer Taylor Swift went viral on social media.\n\nThe oversight board, which reviews moderation decisions and has been likened to Facebook’s “Supreme Court”, is examining two incidents where images of naked women generated by artificial intelligence were reported on Meta’s platform.\n\nOne incident involved a synthetic nude image of a public figure from India on Instagram. The second centred around an “AI-generated image of a nude woman with a man groping her breast”. The woman resembled an unnamed American celebrity, with the board declining to provide details on who the person in question was when asked.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile not mentioning Ms Swift, the investigation comes after explicit fake pictures of the singer spread rapidly across Facebook, Instagram and X in January, prompting an outcry about online misogyny and abuse directed at women.\n\nThe controversy reached the White House, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declaring the spread of deepfake nudes of the singer “very alarming”.\n\nThe oversight board said it would investigate the effectiveness of Meta’s enforcement practices, as well as “the nature and gravity of harms posed by deepfake pornography including how those harms affect women, especially women who are public figures”.\n\nThe deepfakes of Ms Swift also sparked concerns that AI tools will be misused on a grand scale to create huge volumes of deepfake pornography. Fake images of celebrities have also been used to promote scams on social networks.\n\nThe oversight board said it was investigating “whether Meta’s policies and its enforcement practices are effective at addressing explicit AI-generated imagery”.\n\nThe picture from India was not reviewed within 48 hours and remained online until it was appealed to the board, before Meta ultimately decided to take the picture down.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe deepfake of the US celebrity was blocked under Meta’s bullying and harassment policy, specifically its rules on “derogatory sexualised photoshop or drawings”. The user who posted the image has since appealed for a review.\n\nMeta has a policy of labelling images uploaded to Instagram or Facebook, in some cases automatically, if it detects the image is made with AI.\n\nLaunched in 2020, Meta’s oversight board has reviewed thorny moderation decisions made by the technology giant, such as its decision to ban former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 22-person board features figures such as former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former prime minister of Denmark.\n\nSome critics have raised questions over its impact, and its decisions are not binding on the tech giant.",

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Sizzling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) space is red-hot right now. Companies across every industry are looking to capitalize on the technology, and are investing heavily to gain an edge over the competition. That's true in the social media space, where advertisers are keen to get in front of the right audience for them.\n\nWhile the social media landscape is jam-packed with competition, one company is separating itself from the pack. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is making strides across various aspects of the AI realm, and its performance over the competition shows.\n\nLet's dig in to why now is a lucrative opportunity to invest in Meta as the long-term AI narrative plays out.\n\nThe profit machine is up and running\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of Meta is how efficiently management runs the business. In 2023, Meta grew revenue 16% year over year to $135 billion. However, the company increased income from operations by a whopping 62% year over year to $46.7 billion.\n\nBy expanding its operating margin, Meta recognized significant growth on the bottom line as well. Last year, the company generated $43 billion in free cash flow. With such a robust financial profile, Meta is well-positioned to invest profits back into the business as well as reward shareholders. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvesting for the future\n\nDuring Meta's fourth-quarter earnings call in February, investors learned how the company is deploying its cash heap. For starters, it has increased its share repurchase program by $50 billion. This is encouraging to see as it could imply that management views Meta stock as a good value.\n\nBut perhaps more exciting was the announcement of a quarterly dividend. Many high-growth tech companies are not in a financial position to pay a dividend -- or instead choose to reinvest profits into research and development or marketing strategies. Meta's new dividend certainly sets the company apart from many of its peers, and is a nice sweetener for long-term shareholders.\n\nAnother way Meta is using its cash flow is in the realm of artificial intelligence. Like many enterprises, Meta relies heavily on sophisticated graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. However, Meta has been hinting for a while that the company is investing in its own hardware. Earlier this month, Meta announced that an updated version of its training and inference chips, called MTIA, is now available.\n\nThis is important for a couple of reasons. Namely, in-house chips will allow Meta to \"control the whole stack\" and scale back its reliance on semiconductors from third parties. Additionally, given the company's knowledge base of data that it collects from social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, these new chips put Meta in a position to improve its targeted recommendation models and ad campaigns through the power of generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nA compelling valuation\n\nMeta competes with a number of players in the social media landscape. Alphabet is one of the company's top competitors given that it operates the world's top-two most visited websites: YouTube and Google. However, in 2023 Alphabet only grew its core advertising business by 6% year over year. By contrast, Meta's advertising segment increased 16%.\n\nWhile Meta's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10 is higher than many of its social media peers, the company's growth in the highly competitive and cyclical advertising landscape may warrant the premium. META PS Ratio Chart\n\nAdditionally, considering Meta's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 31 is actually trading relatively in line with its 10-year average of 32, the stock might not be as expensive as it appears.\n\nOverall, I am optimistic about Meta's aggressive ambitions in artificial intelligence -- an investment that is yet to play out. The AI narrative is going to be a long-term story. But I see Meta as extremely well-equipped to take advantage of secular themes fueling AI, and benefiting across its entire business.\n\nThe combination of a dividend, share buybacks, consistent cash flow, and a compelling AI play make Meta stick out in a highly contested AI landscape. I think now is a great opportunity to scoop up shares in Meta and prepare to hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Skip It! Reddit Stock Will Give You a Bad Case of ‘IPO Hangover.’",
        "content": "Many stock traders want to catch the next hot initial public offering (IPO) in hopes of a multi-bagger. If they get lucky, they’ll find the next Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Don’t count on Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) becoming the next Meta, however. If Reddit stock gives you anything, it will only be headaches and harsh lessons.\n\nI’ll admit that I got caught up in the excitement surrounding Reddit’s IPO. Soon afterward, however, I noticed some insider share selling and became wary of Reddit as an investable company. Now, I’m leaning bearish and wouldn’t touch Reddit stock with a 10-foot pole, and as we’ll see, I’m not the only commentator who’s waving the red flags.\n\nIs Reddit ‘Grossly Overvalued’?\n\nSometimes, it’s challenging to assign a value to a new IPO stock. Nevertheless, analysts with Hedgeye Risk Management evidently weren’t afraid to call Reddit stock “grossly overvalued.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, the Hedgeye analysts feel that the stock should trade closer to $34, which was RDDT stock’s IPO price (though the stock actually debuted for public trading at $47). Looking ahead, Hedgeye analyst Andrew Freedman is “focused on 2H24 and 1H25 where we expect a rapid deceleration in user and revenue growth” for Reddit.\n\nIt’s difficult to assign any value to Reddit at all, since the company hasn’t delivered an annual profit since 2005, when the company first launched. Thus, Reddit has no earnings and no trailing price-to-earnings ratio. Perhaps there is another metric we can cite — but we’ll get to that in a moment.\n\nThe Hedgeye analysts aren’t the only Wall Street experts with concerns about Reddit. For example, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Shmulik asked, “[W]hat hope does Reddit have with their worst-in-class engagement, anonymous user base, and NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content?”\n\nReddit Won’t Be the Next Meta Platforms\n\nIf you’re waiting for Reddit to turn a profit soon, this might only be a pipe dream. “The longer term promises — grow the ad base, profits just around the corner and the dream of all the non-ad upside — are promises we’ve heard too many times,” the Hedgeye analysts warned.\n\nThe point here is that investors shouldn’t try to compare Reddit and Meta Platforms, even if they’re both social media companies.\n\nOn that topic, Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese pointed out “worlds of differences” between Meta and Reddit. He observed “3 billion active users [for Meta Platforms]. And under 100 million [for Reddit]. Wildly profitable [Meta], no profits [Reddit].”\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Basenese cited Reddit’s price-to-sales ratio (trailing, I presume), since he can’t use a trailing P/E ratio for an unprofitable company. He stated that Reddit is trading at “like a nine times price to sales ratio, which is on par with Meta.”\n\nA gigantic, profitable Magnificent Seven member like Meta Platforms might be able to justify a P/S ratio of 9x. With Reddit, however, it’s a different story. Again, as Basenese noted, Meta Platforms is highly profitable and has a superior active user base.\n\nReddit Stock: Don’t Catch a Case of IPO Fever\n\nDon’t get the wrong idea here. Certainly, IPO stocks can be exciting and profitable. After the rise and fall of Reddit stock, though, it’s hard to build a compelling bullish argument.\n\nIt’s a shame, as I once had high hopes and thought that Reddit had “next Meta” potential. After carefully comparing Reddit and Meta Platforms, however, I can now see “worlds of differences.”\n\nIt’s not a good time to buy Reddit stock. And if you bought Reddit shares and have any profits, it’s wise to sell the stock now.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Oversight Board is reviewing the company's handling of two sexually explicit AI-generated images of female celebrities that circulated on its Facebook and Instagram services, the board said on Tuesday.\n\nThe board, which is funded by the social media giant but operates independently from it, will use the two examples to assess the overall effectiveness of Meta's policies and enforcement practices around pornographic fakes created using artificial intelligence, it said in a blog post.\n\nIt provided descriptions of the images in question but did not name the famous women depicted in them in order to \"prevent further harm,\" a board spokesperson said.\n\nAdvances in AI technology have made fabricated images, audio clips and videos virtually indistinguishable from real human-created content, resulting in a spate of sexual fakes proliferating online, mostly depicting women and girls.\n\nIn an especially high-profile case earlier this year, Elon Musk-owned social media platform X briefly blocked users from searching for all images of U.S. pop star Taylor Swift after struggling to control the spread of fake explicit images of her.\n\nSome industry executives have called for legislation to criminalize the creation of harmful \"deep fakes\" and require that tech companies prevent such uses of their products.\n\nAccording to the Oversight Board's descriptions of its cases, one involves an AI-generated image of a nude woman resembling a public figure from India, posted by an account on Instagram that only shares AI-generated images of Indian women.\n\nThe other image, the board said, appeared in a Facebook group for sharing AI creations and featured an AI-generated depiction of a nude woman resembling \"an American public figure\" with a man groping her breast.\n\nMeta removed the image depicting the American woman for violating its bullying and harassment policy, which bars \"derogatory sexualized photoshops or drawings,\" but initially left up the one featuring the Indian woman and only reversed course after the board selected it for review.\n\nIn a separate post, Meta acknowledged the cases and pledged to implement the board's decisions.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.’s Oversight Board is investigating the company’s handling of AI-generated deepfakes of an “American public figure,” following a surge of such images depicting singer Taylor Swift earlier this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Yields Spike as Hawkish Powell Puts 5% in Play: Markets Wrap China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Beyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI IMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning Debt Iran’s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on Edge\n\nThe board will evaluate whether two separate AI-created images depicting “nude” women posted on Facebook should have been removed under Meta’s content policies, according to a statement Tuesday. The organization, which is funded by Meta but designed to be independent, reviews content decisions made on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nSexually explicit deepfake images of Swift began flooding Facebook, Instagram, X and other social media platforms in January, prompting outcry from the White House, AI experts and advocacy groups. One of the images now under review matches the description of a deepfake of Swift that went viral, but the Oversight Board declined to name the public figure in the case.\n\nThe board will begin reviewing that case over the next several weeks, along with a similar incident involving an Indian public figure who is also female.\n\nMeta has policies against sexual content and AI-generated images that can mislead people. In the case of the “American public figure,” the deepfake was initially removed, but one of the users who posted the image has appealed to the Oversight Board to have it restored.\n\n“Deepfake pornography is a growing cause of gender-based harassment online and is increasingly used to target, silence and intimidate women — both on and offline,” said Oversight Board Co-Chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt. “It’s critical that this matter is addressed, and the board believes it’s important to explore whether Meta’s policies and enforcement practices are effective at addressing this problem.”\n\nMeta and other social media companies have struggled to moderate the influx of fake and misleading AI-generated content on their sites in recent months. The barrage has included manipulated audio mimicking President Joe Biden’s voice and hoax videos of dead children and teenagers — with the posts amassing millions of views across social media.\n\nThe Oversight Board — founded in 2020 and made up of academics and other legal and human rights experts — can make recommendations about which posts should stay up on Facebook and Instagram, but Meta isn’t obligated to take them. Its advice can also guide how the company crafts its policies on AI and other contentious topics.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe board has reviewed previous high-profile content moderation decisions, including Meta’s decision to ban then-US President Donald Trump. His accounts on Facebook and Instagram were restored last year.\n\nMeta, based in Menlo Park, California, has already changed its policies about AI-generated content this year in response to a previous Oversight Board review. In that case, the company decided to allow more AI-generated content to stay up on its sites, even if that content was misleading.\n\nWhile Meta isn’t required to take the board’s recommendations, the company must respond within 60 days.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Nate Raymond\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday won the dismissal of some claims in a dozen lawsuits accusing him of concealing from the public that Facebook and Instagram were harmful to children.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, came in the sprawling litigation by children pursuing hundreds of lawsuits accusing Meta and other social media companies of addicting them to their platforms.\n\nTwenty-five of those cases sought to hold Zuckerberg personally liable, saying Meta's billionaire founder created a false impression about the platforms' safety despite repeated warnings they were unfit for children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that his public stature and outsized role as the \"trusted voice on all things Meta\" created a duty under several states' laws for Zuckerberg to speak fully and truthfully on the risks its products posed to children.\n\nBut Rogers said the plaintiffs could not rely on Zuckerberg’s comparative knowledge about Meta's products to establish he personally owed such a duty to each plaintiff. Such a ruling, she said, would create \"a duty to disclose for any individual recognizable to the public.\"\n\n\"The court will not countenance such a novel approach here,\" she said.\n\nMeta, which remains a defendant, declined to comment. The company denies wrongdoing.\n\nHundreds of lawsuits are pending before Rogers filed on behalf of individual children against Meta and other social media companies, including Alphabet, which operates Google and YouTube; ByteDance, which operates TikTok; and Snap, which operates Snapchat.\n\nThe lawsuits say the children suffered physical, mental and emotional harm from social media use, including anxiety, depression, and even suicide.\n\nThe litigation seeks damages and a halt to the practices the defendants say are harmful. Several states and school districts have also filed lawsuits against Meta, which remain pending.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston. Editing by Gerry Doyle)",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best machine learning stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the machine learning industry, go directly to the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably. However, that is not the case as machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data, make predictions, and automate tasks without explicit programming. On the other hand, artificial intelligence includes a broader range of techniques that aim to create systems capable of human-like intelligence, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global AI market was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2023 and 2032, reaching $2.575 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Precedence Research estimated machine learning's market value at $38.11 billion in 2022 and expects it to reach $771.38 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 35.09% over the projected period, between 2023 and 2032.\n\nCompanies Leveraging Machine Learning\n\nWhile there are a handful of companies that are actively working on developing products toward the advancement of machine learning, there are many companies that depend on machine learning technology to run their operations. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) leverages machine learning to influence content creation decisions and personalize the user interface. Moreover, the company’s recommendation system uses ML to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions. Netflix, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to deliver tailored content experiences to its subscribers drives user retention and platform growth. The company made the following comments in one of its articles:\n\n“At Netflix, the Machine Learning Platform (MLP) team has been investing in research to push the boundaries of ML Performance over the years. Our state-of-the-art ML performance infrastructure serves as a strong foundation to leverage the latest research in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Infrastructure, GPU Memory Management, Graph Neural Networks, and more recently Large Language Models. We are building an increasingly active engagement with Academia and have a quickly growing graduate ML Internship program that brings us both new talent & the latest research, providing a bridge between university labs and fast-growing industry applications.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial services institution, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been using AI/ML for over a decade. In the company’s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon said that the company now has over 2,000 AI/ML experts and data scientists. Dimon considers AI an “extraordinary” technology and believes that it is “as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years” such as electricity and the internet. He said:\n\n“We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.”\n\nHe further added that the organization understands the importance of AI and for that reason, it has created a new position, chief data and analytics officer.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia in the AI Space\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the markets by storm and was the top-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2023, gaining nearly 240%. The surge was attributed to limited competition in the AI accelerator market. However, other companies have been making strides to take over NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). On April 9, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled its new AI chip, Gaudi 3. According to the company, the chip is “purpose-built for high-performance, high-efficiency GenAI compute”. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that compared to NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100, Gaudi 3 is much more power-efficient and faster.\n\nOn April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced its new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), an upgrade to MTIA v1 that was introduced last year. The chip has been designed for Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) in-house AI workloads, and to decrease its dependency on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The new MTIA version more than doubled the compute and memory bandwidth while maintaining a focus on efficiently serving recommendation models. According to the company, MTIA is part of its long-term plan to build a strong and efficient infrastructure for handling its AI tasks.\n\nWith the above information in mind, some of the best machine learning stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\nA researcher studying a machine learning model of a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through internet rankings of AI stocks and ML stocks, including our own, in addition to the holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) to come up with 25 potential ML stocks.

The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently launched its generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”\n\n12.

We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Meta to Suspend Threads in Turkey Amid Regulatory Challenges, Aims for Future Reinstatement\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) has announced that it will cease operating Threads in Turkey starting Monday, April 29, in response to an interim order from the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA).\n\nThis decision will likely disappoint many Turkish users actively participating in the Threads community.\n\nMeta will notify all Turkish Threads users of this change through the app before the shutdown date to ease the transition.\n\nAlso Read:Meta Enhances Election Safeguards for 2024 To Tackle Misinformation\n\nUsers in Turkey can either deactivate their Threads profile, preserving the possibility of reactivating it if Threads returns, or delete their profile entirely.\n\nThose opting for deactivation can still access and download their posts using the Download Your Information tool.\n\nThe move came after the TCA issued an interim order that prevented data sharing between Threads and Instagram, a decision Meta disagreed with.\n\nThe company said it believes it complies with all Turkish legal standards and plans to appeal the order.\n\nDespite disagreeing with the TCA’s interim order, Meta temporarily suspended Threads’ operations in Turkey.\n\nMeta intends to maintain a constructive dialogue with the TCA and aims to reinstate Threads for its Turkish user base as soon as possible.\n\nMeta’s launch of Threads in the EU got delayed due to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which, as of July 2023, classified Meta along with other tech leaders like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as platform gatekeepers.\n\nMeta lowered the monthly fee for its ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe to 5.99 euros, down from the initial 9.99 euros. The fee adjustment responds to the DMA’s restrictions on Meta’s ad personalization capabilities, seeking a balance between complying with EU privacy regulations and the DMA.\n\nThis adjustment occurs amidst broader EU scrutiny of Big Tech’s dominance and privacy practices, with Meta contesting a fee to fund the enforcement of the new EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which demands enhanced content moderation from major online platforms.\n\nMeta stock gained 134% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "7 Strong Chip Stocks to Buy Not Named Nvidia",
        "content": "Mention potential chip stocks to invest in and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is likely the first name that springs to mind. That’s for good reason: Nvidia is a dominant force in artificial intelligence and its chips are in high demand. It also seems you can’t read a headline about the stock market that isn’t somehow connected to the company. However, there are plenty of other strong chip stocks to buy not named Nvidia.\n\nSome of those stocks represent firms that are vital suppliers to Nvidia and other chip manufacturers. Others represent firms in direct competition. Still, others represent a mix of suppliers and competition.\n\nWhatever the case, there are many strong choices for chip stocks for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world, if not the most important companies overall. Its stock is the largest foundry globally and a vital link in the supply chain.\n\nMany semiconductor firms rely on a business model known as fabless manufacturing. Such firms design their hardware and chips, manufactured by foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor being the largest.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes roughly 90% of the world’s advanced chips. It is responsible for the cutting-edge, advanced AI chips that firms, including Nvidia, make.\n\nThe company made a bullish call on chip manufacturing demand early this year, forecasting 20% revenue growth. That call immediately spiked shares by more than 10%, and they have since risen by an additional 30%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn’t command the impressive multiples that Nvidia does, but analysts believe it can continue growing at its present price.\n\nMicron (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) suffered more than almost any other chip stock throughout the past few years. Pandemic chip shortages hit the specialized memory chip manufacturers particularly hard. Firms over-ordered Micron chips, a supply glut caused demand for those chips to crater, and the company suffered huge operating losses in 2023.\n\nMicron generated operating losses for the first time in over a decade in 2023. Then, suddenly, the fortunes of the company changed.\n\nThe company’s specialized high bandwidth memory (HBM) is in high demand. It has applications for the artificial intelligence chips that firms demand. It also began producing HBM, which will be used in Nvidia’s H200 chips.\n\nThe company’s HBM products remain in high demand. Most of its 2025 capacity is already booked. HBM allows artificial intelligence chips to perform better, so investors should keep their eye on MU shares. Demand is sky-high, which can still push share prices higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the very best positioned chip stocks available to investors today. It is, of course, the primary challenger of Nvidia’s dominance. It has emerged as such a potent competitor because Its chips are nearly as powerful as those from Nvidia yet cost a fraction of the price.\n\nThus, AMD represents the best bang for your buck in the AI chip landscape. Are enterprises willing to risk investing in AMD chips over Nvidia’s? Leading chip purchasers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI have each announced plans to use AMD’s MI300X AI platform.\n\nHowever, the answer is not that simple. AMD’s newest platform boasts better specifications than Nvidia’s H100 platform. Nvidia is releasing its H200 platform soon. Comparison is, therefore, muddled. Further, Nvidia has stronger software, which is particularly important in AI applications.\n\nOverall, AMD has a chance to compete with Nvidia, although it is not a clear-cut case. It’s why investors should continue to bet on AMD.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another integral link in the advanced chip manufacturing supply chain. The company monopolizes advanced lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. Essentially, no other firm can replicate the products it produces, giving it a near monopoly.\n\nA lot has been said about those extreme ultraviolet lithography machines it produces and their importance overall. While that is integral to its story, let’s look at another less covered factor.\n\nASML has been identified as one of 18 European equivalents to the U.S. Magnificent 7 stocks. UBS (NYSE:UBS) handpicked the Dutch company as one with the potential to outperform significantly. It should be a relatively easy choice for American investors, given that ASML is a tech firm. It is, therefore, very similar to the Magnificent 7, which relies heavily on technology.\n\nAI demand is going to continue to grow. That means ASML’s EUV machines will continue to be in high demand as the cutting edge fabrication machines that they are.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has performed well this year, rising from $140 to $175. That strong performance is paradoxical because the company’s fortunes are generally tied to phone sales.\n\nDemand for expensive handsets is lagging currently. Consumers continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are more hesitant to purchase phones that can easily cost north of $1,000. Qualcomm is a major supplier of cell phone chips, and thus, should struggle.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm is not. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Gen 8 and Snapdragon Gen 8S chips drive the generative AI on the phone market. The company is iterating its generative AI features down throughout the price range of cell phones. Those chips were first applicable to high-end models and, in time, will bring generative AI capability to lower and lower-range models. It is easy, then, to see why QCOM stock makes so much sense at this time: People spend increasingly more time on their phones and AI opportunities therein are massive.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), like Qualcomm, is a reliable stock choice for chip stocks investors. Both firms include dividends that signal overall reliability. That isn’t the primary reason for considering investing in Broadcom, but I wanted to mention it.\n\nThe bigger and more important reason is that Broadcom is an integral chip firm and part of the overall AI opportunity. The company develops infrastructure software solutions for semiconductors. Basically, Broadcom helps chip firms derive greater AI output from the same quantity of power.\n\nThe company is also thriving fundamentally. During the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 34%, reaching $11.96 billion. The company repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock and eliminated them. Broadcom is also known to hike its dividends annually.\n\nAVGO Stock is an excellent choice for more conservative investors looking to exploit the AI boom. While Broadcom doesn’t benefit from outsized valuation multiples like Nvidia, its impressive growth is very attractive.\n\nSkyworks (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip supplier that derives a significant portion of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIt is similar to Qualcomm, an integral chip supplier to the iPhone maker. Like Qualcomm, Skyworks stock currently includes a dividend yielding 2.6%.\n\nThe application of generative AI to handsets is still nascent. That’s arguably the best reason to consider Skyworks at the moment. It derives a significant portion of its sales from cell phones. As that market grows, so should company-wide opportunities. Skyworks is positioned to grow with that emerging market.\n\nInvestors should also note that there are potential pitfalls despite Skyworks’ overall strength.  Apple continually makes efforts to bring chip production in-house. Qualcomm has served as an excellent example of that truth.  The risk that Apple walks away is one that the company continually has to navigate.\n\nYet, Qualcomm has proven that it is difficult for Apple to do so. Thus, the overall opportunity for Skyworks seems to be strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Analysis-When Facebook blocks news, studies show the political risks that follow",
        "content": "By Byron Kaye\n\n(Reuters) - Since Meta blocked links to news in Canada last August to avoid paying fees to media companies, right-wing meme producer Jeff Ballingall says he has seen a surge in clicks for his Canada Proud Facebook page.\n\n\"Our numbers are growing and we're reaching more and more people every day,\" said Ballingall, who publishes up to 10 posts a day and has some 540,000 followers.\n\n\"Media is just going to get more tribal and more niche,\" he added. \"This is just igniting it further.\"\n\nCanada has become ground zero for Facebook's battle with governments that have enacted or are considering laws that force internet giants - primarily the social media platform's owner Meta and Alphabet's Google - to pay media companies for links to news published on their platforms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFacebook has blocked news sharing in Canada rather than pay, saying news holds no economic value to its business.\n\nIt is seen as likely to take a similar step in Australia should Canberra try to enforce its 2021 content licencing law after Facebook said it would not extend the deals it has with news publishers there. Facebook briefly blocked news in Australia ahead of the law.\n\nThe blocking of news links has led to profound and disturbing changes in the way Canadian Facebook users engage with information about politics, two unpublished studies shared with Reuters found.\n\n\"The news being talked about in political groups is being replaced by memes,\" said Taylor Owen, founding director of McGill University's Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy, who worked on one of the studies.\n\n\"The ambient presence of journalism and true information in our feeds, the signals of reliability that were there, that's gone.\"\n\nThe lack of news on the platform and increased user engagement with opinion and non-verified content has the potential to undermine political discourse, particularly in election years, the studies' researchers say. Both Canada and Australia go to the polls in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther jurisdictions including California and Britain are also considering legislation to force internet giants to pay for news content. Indonesia introduced a similar law this year.\n\nBLOCKED\n\nIn practice, Meta's decision means that when someone makes a post with a link to a news article, Canadians will see a box with the message: \"In response to Canadian government legislation, news content can't be shared.\"\n\nWhere once news posts on Facebook garnered between 5 million and 8 million views from Canadians per day, that has disappeared, according to the Media Ecosystem Observatory, a McGill University and University of Toronto project.\n\nAlthough engagement with political influencer accounts such as partisan commentators, academics and media professionals was unchanged, reactions to image-based posts in Canadian political Facebook groups tripled to match the previous engagement with news posts, the study also found.\n\nThe research analysed some 40,000 posts and compared user activity before and after the blocking of news links on the pages of some 1,000 news publishers, 185 political influencers and 600 political groups.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the research confirmed the company's view that people still come \"to Facebook and Instagram even without news on the platform.\"\n\nCanadians can still access \"authoritative information from a range of sources\" on Facebook and the company's fact-checking process was \"committed to stopping the spread of misinformation on our services\", the spokesperson said.\n\nA separate NewsGuard study conducted for Reuters found that likes, comments and shares of what it categorised as \"unreliable\" sources climbed to 6.9% in Canada in the 90 days after the ban, compared to 2.2% in the 90 days before.\n\n\"This is especially troubling,\" said Gordon Crovitz, co-chief executive of New York-based NewsGuard, a fact-checking company which scores websites for accuracy.\n\nCrovitz noted the change has come at a time when \"we see a sharp uptick in the number of AI-generated news sites publishing false claims and growing numbers of faked audio, images and videos, including from hostile governments ... intended to influence elections.\"\n\nCanadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge in an emailed statement to Reuters called Meta's blocking of news an \"unfortunate and reckless choice\" that had left \"disinformation and misinformation to spread on their platform ... during need-to-know situations like wildfires, emergencies, local elections and other critical times\".\n\nAsked about the studies, Australian Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said via email: \"Access to trusted, quality content is important for Australians, and it is in Meta's own interest to support this content on its platforms.\"\n\nJones, who will decide whether to hire an arbitrator to set Facebook's media licencing arrangements, said the government had made clear its position to Meta that Australian news media businesses should be \"fairly remunerated for news content used on digital platforms.\"\n\nMeta declined to comment on future business decisions in Australia but said it would continue engaging with the government.\n\nFacebook remains the most popular social media platform for current affairs content, studies show, even though it has been declining as a news source for years amid an exodus of younger users to rivals and Meta's strategy of de-prioritising politics in user feeds.\n\nIn Canada, where four-fifths of the population is on Facebook, 51% obtained news on the platform in 2023, the Media Ecosystem Observatory said.\n\nTwo-thirds of Australians are on Facebook and 32% used the platform for news last year, the University of Canberra said.\n\nUnlike Facebook, Google has not indicated any changes to its deals with news publishers in Australia and reached a deal with the Canadian government to make payments to a fund that will support media outlets.\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Sold Amazon and Microsoft but Bought This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock",
        "content": "Dan Loeb is known as a mover and a shaker in the investing world. He founded the New York-based hedge fund Third Point in 1995. It now has roughly $11.5 billion in assets under management. Loeb's net worth stands at $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe activist investor did some moving and shaking in his hedge fund's portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Loeb reduced his stakes in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). However, the billionaire investor bought another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock.\n\nTaking profits\n\nLoeb sold 210,000 shares of Microsoft in Q4. While this reduced Third Point's stake in the tech giant by over 9.4%, Microsoft remains the second-largest holding in the hedge fund's portfolio.\n\nThe billionaire investor has owned Microsoft off and on since 2006. He most recently initiated a new position in the fourth quarter of 2022, just in time to ride the generative AI wave started by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT. Microsoft was a major beneficiary of this wave thanks to its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThird Point first owned Amazon in late 2019 and held the stock through the second quarter of 2022. Loeb didn't stay on the sidelines long with the e-commerce and cloud services leader. He initiated a new position in Amazon in the second quarter of 2023. Although he reduced Third Point's stake in the stock by nearly 10.3% in Q4 2023, Amazon still ranks as the hedge fund's third-largest holding.\n\nWhy did Loeb trim his positions in Amazon and Microsoft? The most likely reason is he wanted to take some profits. Both stocks delivered impressive gains last year.\n\nA bigger bet on Meta\n\nAlthough Loeb cooled somewhat on two Magnificent Seven stocks, he placed a bigger bet on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The hedge fund manager increased Third Point's stake in Meta by nearly 5.5% in Q4 2023. The $410.6 million value of the position made Meta the sixth-largest holding for Third Point at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoeb's history with Meta goes back to the second quarter of 2016 when he first bought the stock. He owned shares of the social media company for a little over two years before exiting the position. The activist investor again bought Meta stock in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained a position through 2021 Q4. Loeb went back to the well in the third quarter of 2023 with another new stake in Meta.\n\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, Meta enjoyed a generative AI tailwind last year. However, I suspect that wasn't Loeb's primary reason for adding to his position in the stock. Instead, my hunch is that Loeb liked Meta's moves to increase its profitability.\n\nThose efforts are paying off. Meta's earnings more than tripled year over year in 2023 Q4. Full-year profits jumped 69%.\n\nDid Loeb make the right moves?\n\nIn one sense, Loeb went one for three with these Magnificent Seven transactions. Loeb's decision to increase Third Point's stake in Meta is already paying off. Meta stock has skyrocketed over 45% since the end of 2023. However, Amazon and Microsoft are also up by double-digit percentages year to date. Loeb could have made more money by holding his shares in both companies.\n\nHowever, trimming the positions in Amazon and Microsoft could still have been the right call for Loeb. Both stocks make up significant percentages of Third Point's portfolio. You can't blame any investor for wanting to ensure their holdings aren't overly concentrated in a handful of stocks.\n\nOver the long term, I think that Loeb -- and other investors -- will be well served by owning all three of these stocks. Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses should continue to grow robustly thanks largely to AI. I like Meta's focus on business messaging and smart glasses with embedded AI assistants. I predict Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta will remain magnificent for a long time to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Antitrust fervor is gripping Washington and Silicon Valley. But lawsuits have been declining.",
        "content": "US antitrust lawsuits have been falling since the pandemic despite a high-profile legal war pitting Washington against Silicon Valley.\n\nCivil antitrust cases alleging monopolistic mergers or business practices fell 42% between March 2020 and March 2023, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, dropping to 361 from 626.\n\nThe numbers have gotten smaller despite a wide-ranging push during that period by the Biden administration to limit the concentration of power in key industries, including Big Tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). It is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries.\n\nThe number of government antitrust cases filed for the 12-month period ending in March 2023 fell to 9, from 28 in 2020.\n\nThe number of private suits brought by companies alleging unfair competition in their industries fell to 352, down 42% from 2020.\n\nIt is possible that lawsuits rebounded over the last year; the government's figures for the 12-month period ending in March 2024 are not yet available.\n\nA separate analysis from legal analytics company Lex Machina shows a 19% increase for all of 2023. But even Lex Machina said that its figures show a general decline in antitrust filings over the last decade.\n\n\"Since 2015, the trend has been fairly significantly downward,\" said Ron Porter, a data expert with the company.\n\n\"It's a very real trend.\"\n\n'Not easily answered'\n\nWhy the general decline? Legal observers have a number of theories.\n\n\"It's a good question but not easily answered,\" New York University economist Lawrence White said.\n\nPerhaps a stronger enforcement climate is keeping anticompetitive behavior in check, or the government is choosing to go after bigger targets in exchange for fewer cases to save on costs and staffing.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan told Jon Stewart last week on the Daily Show that when confronting big companies her staff sometimes can be “outgunned” on lawyers by as much as 10 to 1.\n\n\"We play to our strengths,\" she said, by being \"strategic\" and \"entrepreneurial.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing a new antitrust suit against Apple in March. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nOther theories to explain the decline in antitrust cases are that companies increasingly view courts as unreceptive to their claims, or fear that the financial risk to take on an antitrust case is too high.\n\nSome antitrust experts attribute the decrease to federal court decisions in a series of cases, including one Supreme Court case in 2004 where it ruled against arguments that Bell Atlantic and other successor companies to the old AT&T engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n\nMore stringent requirements applied by other courts over the years also increased the burdens on private plaintiffs, particularly class-action plaintiffs, according to a 2020 report from attorneys at law firm Simpson Thacher.\n\nThat, according to the report, resulted in reduced frequency of filings and larger and more complex cases.\n\n\"It has to be a really meritorious case with high potential for significant reward,\" said Randy Stutz, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, an organization that advocates for more robust antitrust enforcement by the federal government.\n\nHe suspects that high bar is likely keeping some credible claims from being filed.\n\n\"The value proposition is changing,\" he added.\n\nThe drop in private cases could be a concern for federal antitrust regulators because corporate plaintiffs can provide \"deregulated\" checks and balances that can be overlooked or under-prosecuted by government regulators, University of Michigan Law School professor Daniel Crane said in a 2010 article. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. (Kevin Wurm/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFederal antitrust regulators like the FTC and the Justice Department have \"become more and more dependent on private actions that serve that deterrent function,\" Stutz said.\n\nWhite, who sits on the advisory board of the American Antitrust Institute, disagrees that the decline in lawsuits can be easily attributed to a single cause, like less enforcement power.\n\n\"I'm very sympathetic to much of what AAI does, otherwise I wouldn't be on their board,\" White said. \"But to wring your hands and decry every time there's a decline in lawsuits filed and think that means there's less enforcement, that doesn't follow.\"\n\nThere's no question, White said, that US court decisions have made it harder to bring antitrust lawsuits. But what makes it complicated to pinpoint the exact cause of a case decline, he added, is that government penalties have become steeper for antitrust violations.\n\n\"Fines are steep,\" he said. \"And people go to jail for price fixing.\"\n\n'The system is rigged'\n\nThe calculus to go forward with an antitrust case is even more challenging for businesses that rely on dominant firms in their supply and distribution chains. Those companies, Stutz said, may shy away from antagonizing a critical partner with an antitrust suit.\n\nTo bring an antitrust suit against Amazon as a private plaintiff you would have to hire a \"fancy antitrust lawyer\" and \"a fancy antitrust economist\" and thus \"the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims individually,\" economist expert Hal Singer, managing director of Econ One, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill during an antitrust hearing in February 2021.\n\n\"And so the system is rigged effectively to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least by private complainants.\"\n\nSome recognizable companies, however, have decided to take on that risk over the past year.\n\nThe latest crop of company-initiated cases includes complaints by pharmaceutical giant Regeneron (REGN) against rival Novartis (NVS); publishers Helena World Chronicle and Gannett (GCI) against Google; and a group of pharmacies challenging the actions of Cigna’s pharmacy benefit management organization Express Scripts (CI). Regeneron is among the companies that have decided to bring antitrust suits against other companies. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nCompanies have had mixed results. In two closely watched antitrust cases by popular video game developer Epic Games against Apple and Google over their respective app stores, Epic won its case against Google but mostly lost the case against Apple.\n\nOne private company successfully challenged a merger. The case, brought by door manufacturer Steves & Sons, unwound a tie-up between door and frame manufacturers Jeld-Wen (JELD) and competitor CMI.\n\nAnother set of antitrust cases upended the real estate industry. Residential home sellers across the country alleged the National Association of Realtors, its member agents, and Keller Williams and HomeServices of America illegally required sellers to pay buyers' agent commissions.\n\nA federal jury in Missouri in one case returned a $1.78 billion verdict in favor of sellers, a figure that could as much as triple, or decrease, at the presiding judge's discretion.\n\nAnother case was dismissed. US Wholesale was not able to successfully argue that rival Living Essentials unfairly offered Costco better prices, discounts, and reimbursements on sales of 5-hour Energy. But the case left the door open to allow US Wholesale to refile its claim.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech will outperform in a high interest rate environment: Wall Street pros",
        "content": "No rate cuts, no problem.\n\nInvestors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday’s trading action, despite another hot inflation report that puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt.\n\nThat was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles.\n\n“Many of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,” Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree cash flow from Magnificent 7 members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — jumped more than $100 billion in 2023.\n\nLast week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet’s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year.\n\nAnd Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis.\n\nNewEdge Wealth’s Cameron Dawson said big tech’s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a “defensive” and “safety” play, adding that pullbacks are “likely buyable in the short-term.”\n\n“Tech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,” said Lerner.\n\nIn addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetrick expects continued economic growth to “offer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.”\n\nA more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term. Analysts estimate the sector’s first-quarter profits to surge 20%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives sees first-quarter results as a “major positive catalyst.”\n\n“We expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the strong start to 2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage,” Ives wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nTo sum it up: Delayed rate cuts don't mean a downturn for tech's biggest names. Rather, those with strong fundamentals can outperform — despite valuation and rate concerns — and potentially provide stability for the broader market landscape.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold for Forever",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is sure to produce some very big winners, but it also has the potential to disrupt large incumbents. How to be sure you're investing in one of the AI beneficiaries, and not the disrupted?\n\nThe question is not an easy one. But an assessment of a company's competitive advantages and history defending those competitive advantages may yield clues.\n\nSifting through today's tech landscape, these three companies look like excellent sleep-at-night additions for your AI-focused portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWill Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) be helped or hurt by AI? It certainly appears to be the former, as the company has extremely wide moats across its empire and many ways to win from AI.\n\nObviously, Microsoft has an exclusivity arrangement with OpenAI, the parent company behind ChatGPT. Microsoft has parlayed that savvy partnership into a leadership position in the AI cloud computing races, yielding best-in-class growth for its Azure cloud platform compared with its rivals. As one of only three major cloud infrastructure players, where most AI processing is likely to take place, Microsoft looks poised to benefit from AI's increased computing intensity for years to come.\n\nBut Microsoft's AI advantage goes beyond OpenAI. As a longtime leader in enterprise software, Microsoft has deep relationships with the world's largest businesses going back decades. With a highly regarded brand and with the capital strength to invest in the latest innovation, it's a pretty safe bet Microsoft will be able to use AI to both increase revenues and lower costs over the long-term.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft just rolled out AI CoPilot for Microsoft 365 at a cost of $30 per person per month. That's a big price increase, made possible by the wide moat the Microsoft 365 Office software suite enjoys among corporations.\n\nBut even beyond Azure and Office, Microsoft's other business segments, each with their own wide moat franchises and network effects, all stand to benefit from AI. The LinkedIn social media platform stands to benefit from advanced AI targeting, and Github users should also benefit from AI natural language prompts for code-writing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd let's not discount the effect AI can have on Microsoft's consumer businesses. Microsoft owns the Xbox gaming platform, along with a host of game studios such as the recently purchased Activision-Blizzard, where AI can perhaps aid in content creation and curation. Moreover, as AI moves to the edge, AI PCs could enable Microsoft to raise prices on its Surface line of laptops.\n\nWith several competitively advantaged products and services and leading AI capabilities, Microsoft should be a big AI winner.\n\nASML Holdings\n\nWhat's a good sleep-at-night stock? A company with a monopoly. And that's just what ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML) has, specifically in the technology needed to produce the world's most leading-edge chips: extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV).\n\nAll AI chips worth their salt require EUV lithography order to pack an incredible number of tiny transistors onto a die. Soon, the AI wars will require ASML's \"high-NA\" EUV technology, ASML's latest incarnation of EUV, in order to compete.\n\nThe new high NA system will shrink a chip's critical dimension, or the smallest feature that can be printed on a wafer, down to 8nm, from the 13nm enabled by regular EUV systems. That's a 1.7 times improvement, which will enable new 2nm chips coming in 2025.\n\nThat's why the new high-NA systems cost some $380 million a pop, more than double the cost of the standard EUV systems ASML has sold up until this point. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat paves the way for rapid revenue growth starting soon, which should continue through this decade. Of note, the first company to buy a high-NA system wasn't Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's leading fab company today, but rather Intel. That's because Intel is trying to catch up to TSMC and become one of the world's major foundries. Samsung will likely also follow, as will memory chipmakers, who will all use high-NA at some point this decade to produce the DRAM memory chips also crucial to AI systems.\n\nThe competition among TSMC, Intel, and Samsung, as well as governments worldwide investing in leading-edge chips produced on their own shores assures robust demand for ASML's machines this decade.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nArtificial intelligence will likely cement the advantages of companies with huge numbers of users and amounts of proprietary data. Not only does Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have that in spades with its core Facebook and Instagram platforms, but Meta is also becoming a big player in building AI models itself.\n\nIn its core business, AI can help show Reels in which users are more likely to be interested. And for monetization, AI helps create and optimize ads, increasing returns on ad spend for advertisers and therefore increasing the price Meta can charge per ad.\n\nMeta is also building large language AI models itself under the Llama brand name. Interestingly, Meta has decided to make Llama open-source, essentially giving the code away to developers. That's a curious strategy and differentiated from competitors, but it could be effective. The contributions of third parties can potentially improve Llama relative to what Meta could do alone, and the open nature of the model could attract top talent.\n\nMuch like Facebook didn't make any revenue at first as it scaled, Llama doesn't make a lot of money now, although other cloud platforms do pay Meta a fee to host the Llama model in their clouds. However, if Llama is used as a baseline model for many future applications, there is more potential for monetization there.\n\nMeanwhile, like all other big tech companies, Meta just introduced its own AI chips called Artemis. Meta claims running workloads on Artemis with it own optimized software will help reduce costs and save energy, although it will still be buying lots of Nvidia chips. too.\n\nMeta has also overcome many challenges in the past. These include the transition to mobile, the threat of Snap, then the even bigger challenge from Bytedance's TikTok. But Meta has managed to use its incumbent position and technological agility to fend off these tech challengers and thrive.\n\nCombined with a brand new dividend, Meta is another stock investors can feel comfortable buying and holding for the long term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Prediction: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Outgain Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "After skyrocketing more than 7x since the end of the third quarter of 2022, Nvidia is now close to correction territory. The high-flying stock may fall even more.\n\nInvestors could be champing at the bit to buy Nvidia on a pullback. That could prove to be a smart move over the long term. However, there are other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to consider. I predict the following three AI stocks will outgain Nvidia over the next five years.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been a big winner from the AI boom, with its shares jumping more than 40% during the last 12 months. Although this performance doesn't hold a candle to Nvidia's, Alphabet could pick up steam while Nvidia loses some momentum.\n\nValuation is a top consideration. Nvidia trades at nearly 35x sales, while Alphabet's price-to-sales multiple is below 6.5. Sure, I fully expect Nvidia will generate stronger sales growth than Alphabet over the next few years. However, Nvidia stock is priced for perfection -- and most companies don't deliver perfection for very long.\n\nAlphabet has almost become an AI underdog in the minds of some investors after public embarrassment with its generative AI models. Don't underestimate the company's AI expertise, though. Apple could implement Google Gemini in its iPhones, according to Bloomberg. If this happens, I believe it will provide a major catalyst for Alphabet stock.\n\nI also think Waymo will become a major growth driver for Alphabet over the next five years. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest projects the robotaxi market will top $10 trillion in sales by the early 2030s. I'm not that optimistic, but I still expect this market to take off, with Waymo as one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been one of the best-performing megacap stocks not named Nvidia. Shares of the social media giant have soared close to 140% over the last 12 months, and I think Meta has more room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike several other big tech companies, Meta is trying to reduce its dependence on Nvidia's GPUs by using its own AI chips. Also like several of its peers, Meta is more attractively valued than Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia faces increasing competition, Meta might benefit from less competition. A bill is making its way through the U.S. Congress that would require Bytedance to divest TikTok or face the consequences of an effective ban in the U.S.\n\nI don't think Meta requires a TikTok ban to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, though. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed last year that business messaging will be the company's \"next major pillar.\" More recently, he said that smart glasses with embedded AI assistants could be Meta's \"killer app.\" I suspect Zuckerberg is right on both counts.\n\n3. UiPath\n\nGreat AI stocks aren't limited to megacap monsters. UiPath(NYSE: PATH) hasn't delivered the level of sizzling returns Nvidia has over the last 12 months and it hasn't kept up with Alphabet and Meta, either. However, with a market cap of only $12.4 billion, UiPath could grow much larger over the next five years.\n\nI recently wrote that UiPath was my pick for the best AI stock to buy right now. Its relatively small size was a key factor in my selection process. More importantly, I view UiPath as an AI company on the rise and in its early stages of growth.\n\nUiPath is the leader in robotic process automation (RPA), and this market is expanding by leaps and bounds. Unsurprisingly, UiPath continues to deliver exceptional sales growth, with revenue soaring 31% year over year in Q4 to a record high. It also achieved profitability for the first time -- a major milestone that could set the stage for accelerated stock gains.\n\nThe rapid advances in AI are allowing the company to automate business processes that it couldn't do in the past, and UiPath is seizing this opportunity. It launched Clipboard AI last year, with TIME magazine naming it one of the best inventions of 2023. UiPath also introduced its AutoPilot AI-powered assistant in Q4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Everyone's been talking about artificial intelligence (AI), and it may be one of the hottest investment areas today. Why? Because the technology has the potential to transform many industries, saving time and money for companies, and even result in lifesaving discoveries -- such as better drugs and medical devices. Analysts expect the AI market to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nEven though many AI stocks have soared, though, this doesn't mean you've missed out if you haven't already invested in this exciting field. The AI growth story is just getting started, meaning there's plenty of room for the strongest players to continue advancing over time. So, if you're ready to invest in AI, check out these two stocks that make solid long-term bets. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nYou probably know Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) best for its e-commerce business, but the company is also building its presence in the world of AI. It's using the technology to streamline operations within fulfillment centers, for example, and better serve customers. But where Amazon truly is going all in on AI is in the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" chief executive officer Andy Jassy wrote in Amazon's recent shareholder letter. He also said generative AI may be the biggest game-changing technology since the Internet.\n\nJassy says Amazon is \"deeply investing\" in the three layers that make up AI -- over time, this could make AWS the go-to place for businesses seeking to launch AI projects. These layers include the building blocks for foundation models such as chips and software, a fully managed service for customers wanting to leverage an already existing foundation model, and finally applications driven by AI.\n\nSince AWS today is the world's No. 1 cloud computing company, it's perfectly positioned to sell these solutions to customers and become an AI giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd when you buy shares of Amazon, you have this exposure to a high-growth area but also the security of booming e-commerce and cloud businesses that helped the company report double-digit revenue growth last year and more than $30 billion in net income. All of this makes Amazon stock, trading at 44 times forward earnings estimates, well worth the price.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another company that may be an important part of your daily life -- if you use Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram. This social media giant owns all four, and thanks to these apps, it brings in billions of dollars in advertising revenue every year. Chances are this will continue because two things in particular should keep users coming back to Meta, therefore prompting advertisers to keep coming back to reach them.\n\nFirst, Meta has a strong moat or competitive advantage in the world of social media, and that's its broad audience of loyal users -- making it difficult for any of us to switch to another platform. If we do, we may not be able to connect with all of our contacts. Meta estimates that more than 3.1 billion people use at least one of its apps every day.\n\nNow here's the second reason why Meta should stay ahead. The company is putting a focus on AI, making the technology its biggest investment area this year. Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg says he aims to bring on board about 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) of compute this year in order ensure enough capacity for the company's projects.\n\nMeta's plan includes launching AI tools across its products and services, making them better and better for both leisure and professional use. And Meta, developer of the Llama large language model, is maintaining its software as open source so that it might become an industry standard -- another positive point for the company. Considering this and Meta's track record of earnings growth, the stock looks cheap at 26 times forward earnings estimates -- and makes a solid AI bet to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,963!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $33,315!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $335,887!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 8, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Taking the Fight to Nvidia",
        "content": "If there is one stock that exemplifies the potential to profit from artificial intelligence (AI), it would have to be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that rendered lifelike images in video games. What makes these chips so effective is parallel processing, which takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Nvidia was able to adapt this technology to handle the rigors of AI, making it arguably the most successful company in the AI chip space.\n\nHowever, as demand for AI has accelerated, numerous technology stalwarts have been working furiously behind the scenes to come up with viable alternatives to Nvidia's industry-leading processors. This week saw a number of announcements as rivals unveiled the fruit of these efforts.\n\nLet's take a look at three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Intel\n\nEarlier this week, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its latest AI chip, dubbed Gaudi 3, in a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU dominance. The company claims that Gaudi can train AI models nearly twice as fast as Nvidia's H100 flagship data center processor and 50% faster for inference -- running AI models that have already been trained. The company also said Gaudi delivered all that performance with 40% better power efficiency than the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost,\" according to Intel.\n\nIt's important to note that Nvidia recently unveiled the successor to its H100, its Blackwell B200 AI GPU, which will begin shipping later this year. While Gaudi wasn't compared to the B200, the company said, \"We do expect it to be highly competitive\" against Nvidia's latest processor, calling Gaudi \"a strong offering.\"\n\nIntel is likely not looking to outperform Nvidia's most recent AI chips but rather offer enterprises a cheaper alternative. It's also worth noting that there's been an ongoing shortage of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips, creating a bottleneck in AI adoption. Intel's latest offering could help alleviate the backlog.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nNot to be outdone, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) announced the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v2, a custom AI chip that runs in the company's data centers. Meta announced that the latest version of its MTIA \"more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth\" of its predecessor. Early results suggest the new processor performs three times better than the first version.\n\nMeta noted that it's trying to provide \"the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity\" with its latest chip. The company isn't using these chips for AI processing; at least, not yet. Meta is using the processors to improve the speed and efficiency of its ranking and recommendation systems, used to surface relevant content on its social media sites and target advertising.\n\nMeta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, so if it is successful in its AI chip efforts, the company could reduce its dependency on Nvidia's AI processors.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAt the Google Cloud Next event this week, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) announced the availability of Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5p, the latest version of its AI-centric processor. The company said its Cloud TPU can train large language models (LLMs) -- which underpin AI systems -- three times faster than version 4.\n\nAs is generally the case, Google's TPUs won't be sold but will be available on Google Cloud later this year.\n\nHowever, in a blog post, Google noted that it's expanding its Nvidia GPU capabilities with the addition of the A3 Mega Supercomputer, which is powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs. Google Cloud customers will also have access to virtual machines (VM) featuring Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Grace Blackwell GB200 GPUs.\n\nGoogle also unveiled Axion, its first data center central processing unit (CPU), designed in conjunction with Arm Holdings. Google says Axion is 30% faster than the leading CPU, with 50% better performance and 62% greater efficiency than x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nAn important takeaway for Nvidia investors\n\nWhile Intel intends to compete directly with Nvidia for a piece of the AI chip market, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are developing their own AI chips for specific purposes, either in-house or for cloud customers. Furthermore, while Intel claims its AI-centric chips can compete head-to-head with Nvidia's flagship processors, Nvidia has already moved on and will soon be shipping the next version of its state-of-the-art AI processors.\n\nThis helps highlight Nvidia's enviable position in the industry -- its rivals are always playing catch-up. They claim to best Nvidia in terms of performance, but their bragging rights don't last, as Nvidia's next-generation chips are already on the way.\n\nIt's also important to point out that the market for generative AI is growing at a rapid clip, increasing the market for these cutting-edge processors. As a result, Nvidia will likely maintain its industry-leading position, even as rivals enter the fray.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's What Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Strong Returns On Capital Mean",
        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.25 = US$50b ÷ (US$230b - US$32b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nTherefore, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 25%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.1% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Meta Platforms Tell Us?\n\nMeta Platforms deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has consistently earned 25% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 119% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line On Meta Platforms' ROCE\n\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 187% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Meta Platforms, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nMeta Platforms is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "title": "7 Semiconductor Stocks to Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million: April 2024",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are a buy as the Nasdaq continues to make higher highs. These companies have been benefiting from the growing demand for electronic devices and the increased adoption of various technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G.\n\nThe semiconductor industry’s ability to continuously innovate and develop more efficient, smaller, and faster chips is a reason investors should follow this industry closely.\n\nGenerally, semiconductor stocks outperform all others in the Nasdaq composite, so if one wants to have market-beating returns, then a sizable investment into this industry could be suitable. Although the ups and downs of the industry may be significant, I feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks involved.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo with this backdrop in mind, here are seven semiconductor stocks that I feel have a reasonable chance of turning $100,000 into $1 million within seven years. Don’t miss out on this opportunity or you may end up regretting it.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a significant share price increase of 84.66% over the past year. This surge is part of the company’s strategic shift from focusing on traditional PC sales to emphasizing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAMD’s growth in the AI sector is propelled by its Instinct MI300 accelerators, which aim to deliver an eightfold improvement in AI training performance compared to older models. The company anticipates generating around $2 billion from AI chip sales.\n\nThere is a strong market interest in AMD’s new offerings, with several large hyper-scale customers, potentially including high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), OpenAI, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWhat makes AMD a buy for me is that it has courted the attention of Wall Street analysts, as well as reaching meme stock status. It could then easily become a multibagger due to these combination of factors, which makes it one of those semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nSilicon Laboratories (SLAB) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSilicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB) is another one of those semiconductor stocks that investors should consider but it’s a different beast to the marquee names.\n\nThe reason I like SLAB is that it has a concentration into the IoT market, and also has a diversified base of earnings from customers from different industries. This diversification could provide a more stable earnings base compared to companies solely dependent on the more cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, SLAB’s shares have seen a significant decline of 21.24%% over the past year. This is where my thesis kicks in, as I believe that SLAB is undervalued when compared to its long-term potential.\n\nAlthough its P/E ratio is negative, it trades for just 5 times its sales, and looking ahead, analysts predict that it will reach breakeven profitability in the near future.\n\nThis then makes SLAB one of those semiconductor stocks that could turn $100,000 to $1 million as its fundamentals improve.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (MPWR) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy. breakthrough stocks. Mario Gabbeli stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is a company that has momentum firmly on its side. I covered MPWR back in November last year, and it has since gained around 20% at the time of writing.\n\nI remain firmly bullish on the potential of MPWR for the following reasons. First, the company’s management has projected a top-line growth of about 12% annually over the next three years, and analyst expectations are even more bullish.\n\nNamely, analysts predict that MPWR’s EPS will increase around 49% this year, and there is incremental growth expected for this company moving forward.\n\nDespite its market cap of around $30 billion, I think that it still has plenty of room for growth, as evidence by its long-term growth prospects that have been guided by management. It’s then one of those semiconductor stocks to investors to consider.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a significant move with the introduction of its Falcon Shores GPU, designed specifically for AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nTo get the most out of the AI craze, it’s also leveraging significant capital expenditure. This includes a substantial $20 billion investment in constructing two new chip fabrication facilities in Ohio.\n\nI think that INTC also falls under meme stock status due to being the primary underdog of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the chips arms race, which is a positive contributing factor when considering a semiconductor stock to buy.\n\nAnd despite it’s underdog status, I think it has a strong possibility of remaining competitive thru the announcement of its new AI chip. The chip, named Gaudi 3, boasts a 50% performance increase over Nvidia’s older H100 model in inference applications and offers 40% greater power efficiency at a lower cost. This is embelic of its ongoing efforts to carve out a space in the competitive AI accelerator market.\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (MX) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (NYSE:MX) designs and manufactures analog and mixed-signal semiconductors.\n\nI think that MX is primed for a rebound despite its stock price falling 40.55% over the past year.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a revenue uptick from approximately $240 million to $290 million in 2024, with estimates ranging from a low of $265 million to one analyst’s projection of $380 million for 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Magnachip boasts a net cash per share of around $4.2, alongside an active buyback program, having repurchased $25 million worth of shares in the last quarter and announcing an additional $50 million allocation.\n\nIf investors want to 10x their investment, it makes sense that risky investments are indeed that have high implied volatility. MX then ticks this box well, and I think it’s long-term prospects make it an attractive investment that should not be overlooked by those with strong ambitions in the industry.\n\nHua Hong Semiconductor (HHUSF) Here's How Broadcom Stock Fell Back into Favor with Investors\n\nSource: ©iStock.com/lef2481\n\nHua Hong Semiconductor (OTCMKTS:HHUSF) is one of the most prominent semiconductor stocks and chip foundries in China, and thus is worthy of one’s consideration.\n\nIn 2023, the company achieved a milestone by obtaining approval for a $2.6 billion listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest in China for the year. I think this move will expected to enhance its future positioning.\n\nMy thesis for HHUSF and other Chinese semiconductor stocks on this list is due to China’s turn to high-tech manufacturing and increase in internal consumption by the government’s top brass. HHUSF is employing its $2.6 billion listing to fuel its expansion and concentrate on specialized semiconductor technologies, and I believe that the majority of those chips will go towards China-based firms.\n\nAs the premier foundry in China, HHSUF will be vital in producing some of the components needed to fuel China’s high-tech pivot, and trading at around $2 per share, I think it has multibagger potential.\n\nIntchains Group (ICG) BUY spelled out on a computer keyboard representing stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntchains Group (NASDAQ:ICG) is a provider of high-performance computing ASIC chips and software. ICG also has a notable presence in the blockchain industry, and is therefore tied to the ongoing and exponential growth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nThere are a few reasons I think that ICG could be an outperformer. For one, The company recently acquired assets from the Goldshell brand, based in Singapore, for $550,000. This acquisition includes intellectual property essential for Web3 infrastructure.\n\nIt also has $97 million in cash and short-term investments and minimal liabilities totaling $1.9 million. One can say that its fundamentals are strong, and due to its expanding presence in Web3, the future is accretive.\n\nICG is another company based in China, and despite the country outlawing Bitcoin mining, it remains as a key player in the industry and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. ICG along with HHUSF could then be complementary plays in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Tech stocks have rallied in the past year, making it harder for growth investors to find good deals. Demand is high for many popular members of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is up 10% so far in 2024 after soaring last year.\n\nOne great way to minimize your risk of overpaying for a stock in this environment is to have a longer time frame. Investing with a decade or more in mind will allow you to look past short-term volatility and the inevitable ups and downs of market returns.\n\nWith that long-term focus in mind, let's look at two tech stocks that, while they aren't cheap, have a good shot at helping boost your portfolio returns from here.\n\n1. Garmin\n\nIf you've decided to pass on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock right now because of its slow growth, consider owning Garmin(NYSE: GRMN) instead. The tech device specialist expanded revenue at a 13% rate last quarter, compared with Apple's 2% uptick. Garmin saw robust demand for its fitness watches and its GPS-enabled smartwatches, too. \"We are entering 2024 with strong momentum,\" CEO Cliff Pemble said in a press release.\n\nIt's true that Garmin's sales are more heavily tilted toward hardware, which isn't as profitable as software services. That's a big factor behind its weaker operating profit margin of 21%, compared with Apple's 31% rate.\n\nYet Garmin is still generating ample earnings and stellar cash flow. The company produced $1.2 billion of free cash flow last year, translating into nearly 25% of sales. It's available at a decent discount, too, even though shares have rallied in the past year. You can own Garmin for 5.5 times sales today, compared with Apple's premium of 6.9 times revenue.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock will see volatility around its April 24 earnings report, but investors don't have to wait until then to snap up this stellar business.\n\nMeta's core engagement metrics are solid heading into that announcement. The social media giant last reported that its base of daily users hit 3.2 billion through late 2023. And a whopping 80% of its monthly users log on to its family of apps, anchored by Instagram and Facebook, every day.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta is monetizing that usage much better than in the past. Last quarter, average revenue per user crossed $10, thanks to the higher volume of ads the company is showing in feeds.\n\nI'll be looking for Meta to find a way to increase average advertising rates in the upcoming earnings report, which could unlock even faster earnings growth. But its momentum at this point is already quite strong. Operating income jumped 62% last year to reach $46 billion, or 35% of sales.\n\nThe next year might not be nearly as impressive because of Meta's choice to invest heavily in areas such as data centers, artificial intelligence capacity, and its virtual reality hardware. But look for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team to highlight the stellar returns that this spending could generate over the next decade or more. That's the same long-term focus that investors should have for this stock, since it's the best way to ensure that you can weather the volatility that's probably following Meta's huge rally over the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Whether you believe them or not, analyst ratings have long been a strong indicator of the stock price’s direction. There is a direct correlation between how Wall Street analysts rate a stock and how it performs. After all, analysts aren’t just pulling these price targets out of thin air. They use complex formulas that include analyzing the company’s past and present fundamentals to predict its future price multiple.\n\nSo should we blindly follow analyst ratings or price targets? We shouldn’t ever just rely on one rating to buy a stock. Rather, we should use analyst ratings as one indicator combined with other research like fundamentals and technical analysis. If you are looking for some stocks to watch in April, check out these Wall Street analyst favorites.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. As of April 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap with a value of $1.3 trillion. Meta is a favorite of Wall Street analysts and is currently trading right at its average price target of $519.12. The top end of the price target range sits at $600.00, representing a further 14% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn March alone, Meta received 60 analyst ratings, 20 of which were a Strong Buy with 32 more being a Buy rating. This is almost as consensus as it gets among Wall Street analysts. Meta has more than two billion daily active users (DAU) across its platforms and has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the past five years.\n\nDespite gaining more than 145% over the past year, Meta’s stock has gotten cheaper on a price multiple basis. It is now trading at just 10x sales and 26x forward earnings. This makes Meta cheaper than peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NYSE:UBER) is the global leader in ride-sharing with over 130 million monthly active users in more than 70 countries worldwide. The stock has an average price target of $86.56 from analysts which represents an 11% upside from Uber’s current price. The Street-high analyst price target is $100 per share.\n\nEarlier this year, Uber reported its first-ever profitable quarter. This came on the heels of Uber being added to the S&P 500 just a couple of months earlier in December 2023. Now, with the company finally at scale and its delivery growth soaring, analysts are calling Uber a stock to buy. In March, 45 of 48 analyst ratings were a Buy or Strong Buy which indicates just how much Wall Street loves this stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsually, there are some valuation concerns after a stock has gained 143% over the past year. It depends on which metric you use with Uber. The stock is trading at a lofty 60x forward earnings but only four times sales. This divergence is usually caused by rapidly growing revenue with minimal profits, which is exactly the case for Uber. Its revenue has grown at a three-year CAGR of 50%!\n\nTransMedics Group (TMDX) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) is an American medical device and technology company that was founded in 1998. This stock isn’t the most widely covered company, but analysts do have an average price target of $99.40. TMDX is currently trading at a lower price than the lowest end of the one-year analyst price target range of $95.00.\n\nThis company has a market cap of just $2.8 billion and is far from being profitable, but a deeper dive tells you exactly why analysts love this stock. TMDX is the largest ex-vivo organ transplantation company in the world. It designs and implements new technologies to safely transport organs from donors to patients. Some analysts with an Overweight or Strong Buy rating include Oppenheimer, TD Cowen, and most recently initiated by Piper Sandler.\n\nDespite being unprofitable and in hyper-growth mode, TMDX only trades at 11.4x sales even after seeing year-over-year revenue growth of 158.7%. Over the past three years, TMDX has seen a revenue CAGR of 111%. TMDX is an industry leader growing at an exponential rate and it is only a matter of time until the stock price follows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy to Triple Your Investment by 2025",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been on an absolute tear over the past two and a half decades, handily outperforming all other sectors. And with artificial intelligence now supercharging these companies, I believe the tech sector is poised to continue seeing accelerating growth over the next 20 years as well. That’s why it’s critical to have meaningful exposure to top tech stocks in your portfolio, if you want to maximize returns.\n\nHowever, that’s only part of the equation. While tech giants can provide market-beating returns and steady growth, smaller up-and-coming tech stocks (and depressed former high-flyers poised for a comeback) can really juice your portfolio’s return. Hitting a home run on just a couple of these high-risk, high-reward stocks could significantly boost your overall returns over the long-run. Here are three tech stocks that are well-positioned to do just that.\n\nCerence (CRNC) mark stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) is a global leader in AI-powered virtual assistants for the automotive sector. This innovative company develops core technologies, cloud services, and solutions to enable automakers to incorporate conversational voice interfaces into connected vehicles, creating customizable in-car experiences. While the stock has languished recently amid a broader slowdown in the EV sector, I believe Cerence has tremendous long-term growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWorries about slowing EV sales have cast a pall over automotive stocks, even those not directly involved in manufacturing like Cerence. But I think this is a temporary headwind. Once interest rates decline and consumers feel more confident about making large purchases again, demand for EVs is likely to rebound. Cerence’s virtual assistant technology will be embedded in more and more models, leading to rocketing demand for its offerings. Indeed, this is a tech company with a long runway for growth.\n\nThe company’s stock chart looks ugly right now (it’s been trading sideways for some time). However, I think buying CRNC stock at current levels could generate substantial returns in the coming years. Cerence is still trading at a reasonable valuation of just 10-times forward earnings. Revenue is expected to climb 23% this year as well. Considering the massive upside potential for a leading software player in the auto tech space, Cerence seems like a bargain buy around $13 per share.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PYPL stock, PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is another out-of-favor tech stock I’ve been bullish on for a while. Despite a recent slide that has PYPL stock trading 47% below its pre-pandemic peak, I believe PayPal will recover strongly within the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s the leading digital wallet and online payment processor globally after Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). PayPal is accepted virtually everywhere online. With that kind of brand power and reach, I find it hard to imagine this company won’t rebound in a big way. The company’s core business remains solid too, with high single-digit revenue growth ahead.\n\nMuch of the negativity around this stock stems from PayPal’s decelerating user growth, which has even turned negative. But for a mature platform like PayPal, user growth matters less than transaction volume and revenue from existing users. This remains a cash cow operation. PayPal’s management team is aggressively buying back billions in stock as well.\n\nPayPal’s current situation reminds me of Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) stock price languishing due to user growth concerns. Once the economy improves and PayPal potentially pays a dividend, this could be a multi-bagger stock again as it surges much higher.\n\nTransAct Technologies (TACT) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransAct Technologies (NASDAQ:TACT) is an under-the-radar tech stock with diversified revenue streams that is approaching a growth inflection point. This innovative company designs, develops, and markets specialty printers, terminals, and solutions for major growth industries including food service, casino and gaming, POS automation, and oil and gas.\n\nAfter a few challenging pandemic years, TransAct looks poised for a comeback. Analysts are forecasting a return to profitability this year alongside recovering revenue. Growth should accelerate going forward. The company is leveraging strong cash flow from its successful casino printer business to fund its high-margin, recurring revenue board of. health approval (BOHA) restaurant tech offering.\n\nBy targeting large restaurant chains and retailers with this innovative IoT platform, TransAct has massive room for growth ahead. With exposure across so many industries and early signs of a turnaround emerging, this looks like an opportune time to buy TACT stock. If the company can land some big BOHA deals soon, the stock could easily deliver multi-bagger returns over the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The collective of leading technology companies, often referred to as the Magnificent Seven, has seen an increase in their dominance within the S&P 500 Index, despite not all members performing to expectations. This group, which includes some of the most influential names in the tech industry, has expanded its share of the index, now representing nearly a third of its value, surpassing several other major sectors combined.\n\nEven with varied performance among its members, this tech ensemble has reached a new peak in its contribution to the benchmark index. This rise is attributed to the remarkable gains of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared by approximately 81% due to the high demand for its AI computing chips. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also seen significant increases in their stock values, with jumps of 47% and 24%, respectively. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have surpassed the overall S&P 500's performance, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a decline of about 9%.\n\nConversely, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen its shares decrease by around 30% this year, as the electric vehicle manufacturer grapples with slowing demand and investor uncertainty regarding its recovery prospects.\n\nThese tech giants' growing influence within the S&P 500 underscores the significant impact the technology sector has on the broader market, even as individual companies within the group experience varying degrees of success.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Cathie Wood Stock in April, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",
        "content": "These Cathie Wood stocks to buy can make investing much easier. Though her investment funds aren’t generating the stellar returns as they did before the 2022 tech pullback, her knack for identifying groundbreaking opportunities in tech remains unchallenged. Hence, wagering on the top Cathie Wood stocks to buy remains perennially relevant.\n\nCathie Wood’s strategy of focusing on disruptive innovation is one that’s expected to yield tremendous long-term returns. She embodies themes of technological advancement, an approach that’s paid many dividends in the AI-led stock market surge. Moreover, with the likely pullback in interest rates over the next few months, Cathie Wood’s forward-thinking investing strategy could potentially take your portfolio to new heights. Without further ado, here are three Cathie Wood stocks you should consider investing in at this time.\n\nCathie Wood Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) had quite the comeback last year. It was only a couple of years back when it endured the most substantial market value loss in the stock market’s history. However, it completely flipped the script last year, adding $197 billion to its market value, again the biggest in the stock market’s history. Its blow-out quarterly performances, AI and VR investments, and exceptional shareholder rewards set the stage for robust long-term expansion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWood holds a small stake in META as it will likely lead the metaverse, AI, and VR realms. In particular, AI has been a major theme for Meta in the past year, as it looks to unveil its generative AI model Llama 3. The Llama 3 is poised to rival Gemini and ChatGPT and will likely play a major role across its entire software stack. Moreover, it has invested roughly $50 billion in advancing its metaverse endeavors and still has plenty in the tank to continue being a needle-mover in the sector.\n\nWith so much going on for the company at this time, Cathie Wood increased her stake in the company by 7.80% during the fourth-quarter (Q4), adding 22,400 shares.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is one of the biggest players in the fast-evolving big data analytics market. Its stock forms roughly 1.6% of Cathie Wood’s portfolio, reaching 10.9 million shares. Moreover, she added 1.50 million new shares of PLTR stock in Q4. She also lauded the company for its AI-driven potential and the recent shift to profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir’s robust performances and customer growth each quarter continue to prove the naysayers wrong. It was criticized for being too reliant on government contracts, but in recent quarters, the company has seen its commercial clients outpace this segment. Moreover, expanding its customer base indicates its superior execution and ability to attract big-ticket clients.\n\nIts U.S. business clients during Q4 shot up to 221, marking an eye-catching 55% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Also, its U.S. commercial business’s total contract value (TCV) jumped 107% YOY to a whopping $343 million, which points to its success in securing larger contracts.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration the Unity Technologies (U) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGame development platform Unity Software (NASDAQ:U) is an odd pick at this time. Its stock has dropped 36% year-to-date (YTD) due to rising competition, declining profitability, and a sales slowdown. Nevertheless, Cathie Wood added 713,000 new shares in U stock during Q4. This was after offloading 813,000 shares in the previous two quarters.\n\nThough the concerns are genuine with Unity, it’s tough to overlook its massive potential based on the array of use cases in emerging technologies. With stakes in AI, blockchain, metaverse, and other transformative technologies, it is positioned for remarkable long-term growth.\n\nFurthermore, it is looking to restructure, including a 25% reduction in workforce, while pursuing high-value, profitable sectors. This includes advertising, XR headsets, and automotive applications. Also, its AI-focused Unity Muse could be another growth catalyst for the firm. It enables creators to take on some of the most ambitious projects efficiently. Hence, expanding into non-gaming sectors could unlock significant long-term value for its business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN &amp; META Pose Threat to NVDA With In-House Chips",
        "content": "As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) race heats up primarily due to a boom in the generative AI space, the demand for cutting-edge chips that can handle AI-related massive workloads keeps rising. These chips are equipped with strong computing power that makes the training of large language models seamless.\r\n\r\nIn this backdrop, strong endeavors being made by the cloud trio — Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL — as well as the social media giant Meta Platforms META, to put their AI-specific customized chips on the table remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis underscores the idea of staying self-sufficient in the intensifying AI battle in order to accelerate the development process of AI models, which, in turn, will help them pace up advancements in the AI world.\n\nWill NVIDIA Face Challenges?\n\nNVIDIA NVDA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is riding on solid demand for its next-generation chips for AI models. Reportedly, it holds more than 90% of the AI chips market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, the strategy of building in-house chips of these tech giants in order to reduce dependency on outside chip providers does not bode well for NVIDIA. It will stiffen the chip competition for NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nAlso, NVDA will start losing market share if its major customers start making their chips. This is a major concern.\r\n\r\nNotably, the waiting time for its flagship AI chip is months long, which is causing the scarcity. Nvidia can produce only a limited number of chips at a time because it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor to assemble the chip designs.\r\n\r\nThis is the primary reason why AI behemoths are now coming up with their chips.\r\n\r\nEven if the chips being made by Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are not as strong as NVIDIA’s, they can be customized. This will not only save their costs but will also save time.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow GOOGL, META, MSFT & AMZN Fare in AI Chip Race?\n\nAlphabet’s Google recently heated the AI battle with the introduction of its central processing unit (CPU), namely Axion, to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are marked as the company’s first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nAlphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, intends to scale Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine and the YouTube Ads platform on Axion soon.\r\n\r\nGoogle will make Axion available to its cloud customers later this year. Customers will be able to use Axion in cloud services like Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow and Cloud Batch.\r\n\r\nFollowing Google’s move, Meta announced advanced infrastructure for AI to push deep into the AI chip race. It introduced the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. Notably, MTIA is the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s advancement over MTIA v1 — its first-generation AI inference accelerator, which was designed in-house with Meta’s AI workloads.\r\n\r\nNotably, MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth. It is capable of managing the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users, seamlessly. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft unveiled two customized chips, namely Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, late last year. While the Arm-based Cobalt 100 is made for general computing tasks, Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes.\r\n\r\nNotably, Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like LLM training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors. The Zacks Rank #3 company collaborated with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. It is currently being tested on Bing’s AI chatbot Copilot, the GitHub Copilot coding assistant and GPT-3.5-Turbo.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, unveiled AWS Trainium2 chips made for training and running AI models. These chips are designed to power the highest-performance compute on AWS for training foundation models quickly at a lower cost, while consuming less energy. Further, they are capable of delivering up to 4 times better performance and two times better energy efficiency than the first-generation Trainium, which was introduced in 2020.\r\n\r\nNotably, a cluster of 100,000 Trainium chips can train a 300-billion parameter AI large language model in weeks versus months. Trainium 2 chips will be available in Amazon EC2 Trn2 instances, containing 16 Trainium chips in a single instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Tech Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "The technology industry has performed well over the past year. The generative AI boom and other innovative tech products and services have triggered a monumental shift in the market.\n\nA benchmark ETF, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), has increased by over 38% in the last year, while the S&P 500 has only returned 26%.\n\nDespite experiencing a large rally, many of these may offer investors increased upside throughout 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three technology companies that have performed well. Especially this last year, partly due to the overall interest and excitement swirling around companies implementing AI technology and having a strong buy rating.\n\nCelestica (CLS) Person holding cellphone with website of Canadian electronics company Celestica Inc. (CLS) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCelestica (NYSE:CLS) provides supply chain and cloud technology services and products for various industries, including industrials, aerospace and defense, and communications.\n\nOver this past year, CLS’s share price has more than tripled, partly due to its strong earnings growth and growing list of generative AI products.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Celestica reported earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that total revenue increased by 5% and net income nearly doubled to $84 million compared to the previous year. It also provided guidance for the first quarter of 2024, which mentioned that anticipated revenue for the quarter is between $2.025 billion and $2.175 billion, which is in line with reported revenue for Q4 2023.\n\nCelestica has been able to ride the overall technology boom in the stock market higher over primarily just this last year. With its growing exposure to cloud technology and generative AI products and services, Celestica is a solid, strong buy option. CLS is poised to continue its upward trajectory and still offer investors a fair valuation.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is primarily a semiconductor manufacturer that produces GPUs for gaming PCs, cloud-based software, and data center applications. It also provides hardware and software for a machine learning and generative AI platform.\n\nOn Feb. 21, Nvidia announced its earnings result for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, stating that total revenue more than tripled to just over $22 billion year-over-year. Earnings per share for Q4 FY 2023 were fifty-seven cents, and for Q4 FY 2024, they increased to four dollars and ninety-three cents. Most notably, its data center revenue rose more than fivefold, and its professional visualization segment saw its total sales double year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter this stellar earnings report that beat analysts’ expectations, its share price surged by over 16% and has continued to experience growth.\n\nNvidia is a very strong option for investors seeking exposure to the technology industry, which has been on a very impressive trajectory recently. Strong attention is being placed on the burgeoning generative AI industry and other related fields in which NVDA is a massive player. This has assisted in the large increase in Nvidia’s share price, which has more than tripled since April 2023.\n\nViant Technology (DSP) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration. Best Tech stocks. tech stocks trading at bargain prices\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock\n\nViant Technology (NASDAQ:DSP) is an advertising tech company that offers a data platform that uses AI to determine cost-effective media solutions and omnichannel marketing services for marketing agencies.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has more than doubled. It has seen a resurgence in investors’ interest following its dramatic decline in 2021, when it started trading publicly.\n\nInvestors are seeking greater exposure to the online advertising industry, which has been performing very well lately. Such is the case with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), for example. Its advertising revenue is its most profitable segment, which increased in revenue by over 24% from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023.\n\nOn Mar. 4, earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023 were released, stating that total revenue increased by 18% year-over-year.

        "content": "The year 2024 has thus far proved to be a landmark for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, propelled by the technology's rapid growth and accelerating adoption across myriad industries. From healthcare revolutionizing drug discovery and patient care to finance harnessing AI's predictive prowess to manufacturing and optimizing processes with machine learning, AI's disruptive influence cast a broad footprint.\r\n\r\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global artificial intelligence market size is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. It is projected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030.\r\n\r\nVarious companies are implementing AI-based solutions such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to enhance the process workflows to handle and automate repetitive tasks. AI-based solutions are also being coupled with IoT (Internet of Things) to provide robust results for various business processes.\r\n\r\nThe AI in hardware market is poised for remarkable expansion, projected to swell from $20.88 billion in 2023 to $25.96 billion in 2024, exhibiting an impressive 24.3% CAGR. This trajectory is anticipated to persist, with the market forecast to reach $58.61 billion by 2028, maintaining a robust 22.6% CAGR. Key trends expected to shape this period encompass the accelerated pace of urbanization, further dissemination of internet connectivity, the continued evolution of smart city infrastructures, a rising appetite for self-driving vehicles, and an intensifying need for cloud-based computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI and AI-related startups have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft MSFT invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations. Anthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.\r\n\r\nGartner estimates 240 million GenAI smartphones and 54.5 million AI PCs will be shipped worldwide by the end of 2024, representing 22% of all PCs and basic and premium smartphones, respectively. PC shipments are also expected to grow 3.5% in 2024, while smartphone shipments are expected to grow 4.2%.\r\n\r\nAmid the fervent AI boom, shareholders have been hunting for the pioneers and visionaries adept at monetizing AI's capabilities to deliver both ground-breaking innovation and substantial returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nHere, we have picked four tech stocks, NVIDIA NVDA, Twilio TWLO, Meta Platforms META and Zscaler ZS, which, apart from boasting strong fundamentals, have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

The AI chatbot is designed to answer user queries directly within chats, as well as offer them the ability to generate photorealistic images from text prompts. In collaboration with Microsoft, Meta unveiled the next generation of Large Language Model Meta AI (“Llama”), called Llama 2. The social media giant also released Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. The company confirmed earlier this week that it will be launching Llama 3, the next version of its open-source LLM, within the next month.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B.

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Meta Platforms Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.98 billion people on a monthly basis as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nNewly introduced metric, which is the family daily active people (DAP) that measures daily users of its family of products, was 3.19 billion, as of Dec 31. \r\n\r\nMeta uses metrics like daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) to measure Facebook’s user base. As of Dec 31, 2023, DAUs and MAUs were 2.11 billion and 3.065 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\r\n\r\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\r\n\r\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\r\n\r\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\r\n\r\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\r\n\r\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.\r\n\r\nMeta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2014 would be worth $8,938.32, or a gain of 793.83%, as of April 12, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 186.34% and the price of gold increased 73.17% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for META too.\n\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\n\nShares have gained 6.37% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Social media giant Meta has been urged to reverse the lowering of the minimum age to use WhatsApp.\n\nThe change, which reduces the age limit from 16 to 13, came into force in the UK and EU on Thursday.\n\nCampaign group Smartphone Free Childhood said the move by Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram, was “tone deaf”.\n\nCo-founder Daisy Greenwell told The Times: “WhatsApp is putting shareholder profits first and children’s safety second.\n\n“Reducing their age of use from 16 to 13 years old is completely tone deaf and ignores the increasingly loud alarm bells being rung by scientists, doctors, teachers, child safety experts, parents and mental health experts alike.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe continued: “Among parents, WhatsApp is seen as the safest social media app, ‘because it’s just messaging, right?’.\n\n“And in that way it works like a gateway drug for the rest of the social media apps. If you’re messaging your friends on WhatsApp, why not message them on Snapchat?\n\n“WhatsApp is far from risk-free. It’s often the first platform where children are exposed to extreme content, bullying is rife and it’s the messaging app of choice for sexual predators due to its end-to-end encryption.”\n\nConservative MP Vicky Ford, a member of the education select committee, said Meta’s decision to reduce the age recommendation without consulting parents was “highly irresponsible”.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak told the BBC the Online Safety Act would give the regulator powers to ensure social media companies are protecting children from harmful material.\n\nHe said: “They shouldn’t be seeing it, particularly things like self-harm, and if they don’t comply with the guidelines that the regulator puts down there will be in for very significant fines, because like any parent we want our kids to be growing up safely, out playing in fields or online.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhatsApp said the change was bringing the age limit in line with the majority of countries and protections were in place.\n\nMeta this week unveiled a range of new safety features designed to protect users, in particular young people, from “sextortion” and intimate image abuse.\n\nIt confirmed it will begin testing a filter in Direct Messages (DMs) on Instagram, called Nudity Protection, which will be on by default for those aged under 18 and will automatically blur images sent to users which are detected as containing nudity.\n\nWhen receiving nude images, users will also see a message urging them not to feel pressure to respond, and an option to block the sender and report the chat.",

        "title": "12 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best all time low stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news and what might happen later this year, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 Best All-Time Stocks  To Invest In.\n\nAfter a rather devastating 2022 that must have made countless hedge fund managers either lose their hair or see it turn gray, the stock market of Q2 2024 is a markedly different environment. 2022 was the year a significant paradigm shift took place. This came in the form of multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve - a decision that pulled the rug out from below investors' feet even though the warning bells for a rate hike had been ringing since the previous year. Higher interest rates mean that hedge funds find it considerably difficult to raise capital for their risky bets, and high growth stocks also set new all time low records as the broader market becomes wary of their ability to raise capital for growth and fund their daily business operations.\n\nFor instance, while its shares didn't set an all time low as too much easy money had already flown into the stock market by then, 2022 was one of the worst years in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s history. Its shares dipped to below $91 in November 2022 as they effectively reversed all gains made since mid 2015. Similarly, the stock of Elon Musk's Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reversed all gains made since the firm had convinced investors that mass producing an electric vehicle was not simply a paper plan but could be grounded in reality.\n\nSince then, the market has changed. Mark Zuckerberg's net worth almost touched $187 billion in April 2024, making him richer than Musk as the stock market continues to reward Meta's stock for Zuckerberg's well-articulated plans for artificial intelligence, a surprise dividend, and robust earnings performance. Musk, on the other hand, has suffered from a worsening electric vehicle industry hampered by high inflation and a glut in the lithium industry, saw another hit to his net worth in April 2024 after a Reuters report claimed that Tesla had scrapped plans for its highly hyped low-cost EV. This report was also the perfect illustration of the fickle and fast paced nature of today's stock market, as while the stock tanked by 5% in the immediate aftermath of the report, it recovered nearly all these losses during the same trading day after Musk's denial.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile these big ticket names have not set new all time lows, there are some stocks that have touched these levels over the course of the last 12 months despite the market's AI euphoria. One such all time low stock that you might recognize belongs to the iconic American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). AMC, for those unfortunate enough to be out of the loop, was a meme stock that soared by a whopping 490% between April and mid June 2021 in the midst of the meme stock mania of the coronavirus pandemic and is now down 51% year to date and a couple of cents above its all time low share price. Seems like Warren Buffett was right when he said to be fearful when others are greedy, and those who still believed in AMC at the turn of 2024 were surely in for a rude awakening.\n\nAnother all time low stock making the news these days is the premium electric vehicle manufacturer and designer Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID). Operating in the electric vehicle industry is not for the faint of heart right now, and the problems of high inflation, low demand, and a glut are multiplied tenfold for a firm that focuses exclusively on selling expensive and premium cars. Lucid's shares are down by 34.58% year to date, and here's what the firm's management had to say during its latest earnings call:\n\nIn 2023, we made headway with our cost optimization programs, the key strategic priority for the company. We found success in areas, including freight, logistics, overhead and bill of materials. For example, we activated logistics as a part of the Phase II build-out of our Arizona factory, AMP 1, allowing us to bring the vast majority of vehicle components under the same roof as general assembly.\n\nThis enabled us to realize savings from the reduction in overhead, transportation and complexity as well as better efficiency. From an inventory perspective, we drew down raw material inventory levels by high teens percent from the start of Q4 through material planning and inventory management improvements. Improvements in focus accuracy, in particular, allowed us to reduce inventory resulted in savings related to logistics and material handling labor, equipment rentals and storage cost. We also experienced a significant reduction in freight from more efficient transportation and storage planning. For vehicle direct costs, we implemented a number of initiatives that resulted in certain bill of materials cost savings, some of which is directly related to our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nWe have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses that we will look to operationalize over the course of 2024.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, we decided to take a look at some all time low stocks that hedge funds have bought. A couple of notable picks are Klaviyo, Inc. (NYSE:KVYO), Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAGE), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). 12 Best All-Time Low Stocks To Invest In\n\nA trader on the floor of a bustling stock exchange, surrounded by a sea of monitors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best all time low stocks, we ranked stocks whose shares are below 5.5% above their all time lows by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

        "content": "A good stock can help you outperform the market and reach your financial goals sooner. While many investors seek to find a winning stock, it’s best to diversify your holdings across numerous assets. This has led to this list of top stocks to buy.\n\nSpreading your money across multiple stocks minimizes your risk. You also have the opportunity to generate higher long-term returns. It’s good to shop around for stocks even when you feel content with your portfolio. Always reviewing investment ideas allows you to capitalize on great deals when they arrive.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of publicly traded corporations. However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta’s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a “Moderate Buy” with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it’s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It’s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company’s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company’s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle’s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a 50-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a “Strong Buy” rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company’s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don’t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a “Strong Buy.” The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it’s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Instagram said it's deploying new new tools to protect young people and combat sexual extortion, including a feature that will automatically blur nudity in direct messages.\n\nThe social media platform said in a blog post Thursday that it's testing out the new features as part of its campaign to fight sexual scams and other forms of “image abuse,” and to make it tougher for criminals to contact teens.\n\nSexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors. Recent high-profile cases include two Nigerian brothers who pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teen boys and young men in Michigan, including one who took his own life, and a Virginia sheriff’s deputy who sexually extorted and kidnapped  a 15-year-old girl.\n\nInstagram and other social media companies have faced growing criticism for not doing enough to protect young people. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook parent company Meta, apologized to the parents of victims of such abuse during a Senate hearing earlier this year.\n\nThe company said scammers often use direct messages to ask for “intimate images.” To counter this, it will soon start testing out a nudity protection feature for direct messages that blurs any images with nudity “and encourages people to think twice before sending nude images.”\n\n“The feature is designed not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs, but also to protect them from scammers who may send nude images to trick people into sending their own images in return,” Instagram said.\n\nThe feature will be turned on by default globally for teens under 18. Adult users will get a notification encouraging them to activate it.\n\nImages with nudity will be blurred with a warning, giving users the option to view it. They'll also get an option to block the sender and report the chat.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor people sending direct messages with nudity, they will get a message reminding them to be cautious when sending “sensitive photos.\" They'll also be informed that they can unsend the photos if they change their mind, but that there's a chance others may have already seen them.\n\nInstagram said it's working on technology to help identify accounts that could be potentially be engaging in sexual extortion scams, “based on a range of signals that could indicate sextortion behavior.”\n\nTo stop criminals from connecting with young people, it's also taking measures including not showing the “message” button on a teen’s profile to potential sextortion accounts, even if they already follow each other, and testing new ways to hide teens from these accounts.",

        "content": "Meta has unveiled a range of new safety features designed to protect users, in particular young people, from “sextortion” and intimate image abuse.\n\nThe social media giant – which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – has confirmed it will begin testing a nudity filter in Direct Messages (DMs) on Instagram.\n\nCalled Nudity Protection, this feature will be on by default for those aged under 18 and will automatically blur images sent to users which are detected as containing nudity, better protecting users from seeing unwanted nudity in their DMs.\n\nWhen receiving nude images, users will also see a message urging them not to feel pressure to respond, and an option to block the sender and report the chat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the filter turned on, people sending images containing nudity will also see a message reminding them to be cautious when sending sensitive photos, and be given the chance to unsend these photos.\n\nThe tool uses on-device machine learning to analyse whether an image contains nudity, meaning it will work inside end-to-end encrypted chats, and Meta said it will only see any images if a user chooses to report them to the company.\n\n“Financial sextortion is a horrific crime,” Meta said in a blog post on the updates.\n\n“We’ve spent years working closely with experts, including those experienced in fighting these crimes, to understand the tactics scammers use to find and extort victims online, so we can develop effective ways to help stop them.\n\n“Today, we’re sharing an overview of our latest work to tackle these crimes. This includes new tools we’re testing to help protect people from sextortion and other forms of intimate image abuse, and to make it as hard as possible for scammers to find potential targets – on Meta’s apps and across the internet.\n\n“We’re also testing new measures to support young people in recognising and protecting themselves from sextortion scams.” Meta is also cracking down on sextortion (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\nElsewhere, the social media giant said it was testing new detection technology to help identify accounts potentially engaging in sextortion scams and limit their ability to interact with everyone, but especially younger users.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta said message requests from these suspicious accounts would be routed straight to a user’s hidden requests folder.\n\nFor younger users, suspicious accounts will no longer see the “Message” button on an teenager’s profile, even if they are already connected, and the firm was testing hiding younger users from these accounts in people’s follower lists to make them harder to find.\n\nMeta added that it was also testing new pop-up messages for people who may have interacted with such accounts – directing them to support and help if they need it.\n\nIn addition, the company said it was expanding its work with other platforms to share details about accounts and behaviours that violate child safety policies as part of the Lantern programme created last year.\n\n“This industry cooperation is critical, because predators don’t limit themselves to just one platform – and the same is true of sextortion scammers,” Meta said.\n\n“These criminals target victims across the different apps they use, often moving their conversations from one app to another.\n\n“That’s why we’ve started to share more sextortion-specific signals to Lantern, to build on this important cooperation and try to stop sextortion scams not just on individual platforms, but across the whole internet.”\n\nLantern is a programme run between different tech companies which shares information about suspicious accounts.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Instagram will test features that blur messages containing nudity to safeguard teens and prevent potential scammers from reaching them, its parent Meta said on Thursday as it tries to allay concerns over harmful content on its apps.\n\nThe tech giant is under mounting pressure in the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps were addictive and have fueled mental health issues among young people.\n\nMeta said the protection feature for Instagram's direct messages would use on-device machine learning to analyze whether an image sent through the service contains nudity.\n\nThe feature will be turned on by default for users under 18 and Meta will notify adults to encourage them to turn it on.\n\n\"Because the images are analyzed on the device itself, nudity protection will also work in end-to-end encrypted chats, where Meta won't have access to these images – unless someone chooses to report them to us,\" the company said.\n\nUnlike Meta's Messenger and WhatsApp apps, direct messages on Instagram are not encrypted but the company has said it plans to roll out encryption for the service.\n\nMeta also said that it was developing technology to help identify accounts that might be potentially engaging in sextortion scams and that it was testing new pop-up messages for users who might have interacted with such accounts.\n\nIn January, the social media giant had said it would hide more content from teens on Facebook and Instagram, adding this would make it more difficult for them to come across sensitive content such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\nAttorneys general of 33 U.S. states, including California and New York, sued the company in October, saying it repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms.\n\nIn Europe, the European Commission has sought information on how Meta protects children from illegal and harmful content.\n\n(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Alan Barona)",

There is overlap between the stocks in both indices, but the Nasdaq 100 has been the clear winner.\n\nTop-performing index funds and ETFs can offer clues for future opportunities. Diving into these funds and discovering which stocks drove the gains can help investors beat the market. If you’re looking for stocks to buy on the Nasdaq, you may want to consider these three picks.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) offers business safety equipment and supplies to more than one million companies. That’s been a winning formula so far, but that’s only 6.25% of North American businesses. Cintas still has more room to expand and demonstrated that it’s still growing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company grew its revenue by 9.9% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year. Profit margins are expanding and currently sit in the mid-double-digits. Cintas also hiked its dividend by 17.1% in 2024.\n\nThe yield is low at 0.81%, but dividend growth investors can easily overlook that. The stock has gained 47% over the past year and has soared by 222% over the past five years. Shares currently trade at a 42-forward P/E ratio.\n\nCintas is currently rated as a “Moderate Buy” among 12 analysts. The highest price target of $790 per share suggests the stock can rally by an additional 19%.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) offers financial software products like Quickbooks and Turbotax. The company has been outperforming the Nasdaq and is up by 148% over the past five years. The stock has a 0.58% dividend yield but has achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 16.65% over the past 10 years.\n\nThe company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive quarters, and a 34.62% dividend payout ratio gives the company plenty of space for further hikes. Intuit’s financials are also pretty good. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company also grew its net income by 110% year-over-year.\n\nIntuit’s largest segment is also growing at the fastest rate. The company’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group Revenue grew by 18% year-over-year. Intuit recently repurchased $536 million of shares to reward long-term shareholders. The fintech firm has an additional $2.7 billion that has been authorized for stock buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) combines high profits with rising revenue. The company reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 while more than tripling its net income year-over-year. Investments in artificial intelligence and a focus on the bottom line have helped the company tremendously.\n\nThe company’s social networks also exhibited growth acceleration. The number of daily active people across all of the company’s social networks grew by 8% year-over-year. The company is also sitting on $65.40 billion in cash, which prompted its first-ever dividend. Meta Platforms has a low dividend yield, but the company’s dividend growth rate should be exceptional for several years. It’s reasonable to anticipate the dividend increasing by at least 10% per year for more than a decade.\n\nMeta Platforms isn’t only committed to its dividend. The company initiated $20.03 billion worth of stock buybacks in full-year 2023. Meta Platforms reached that milestone by repurchasing $6.32 billion worth of shares in the fourth quarter. The social media giant is rewarding long-term investors with dividends and buybacks while delivering financial growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "You don’t need a lot of money to start building a position in a stock. Shares of many well-known and established companies can be purchased for under-$50. Investors can buy a lot of great stocks for under $20 a share. While you might not be able to buy a single share of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for $500, you could buy 10 shares of other companies whose stocks are trading at $50. Many stocks trading at low prices also have low valuations compared to their peers, making them a bargain to buy.\n\nWhile markets are currently near all-time highs and many stocks have enjoyed huge gains over the past 18 months, there are low-priced alternatives that have yet to participate in the rally. Looming catalysts could change that soon, making now a good time for investors to take positions in some cheaper names. Analysts are certainly finding a lot to like in many low-priced, undervalued stocks. Here is Wall Street favorites: three under-$50 stocks with strong buy ratings for April 2024.\n\nBirkenstock (BIRK) Birkenstock (BIRK) is a German producer of foot wear established in 1774.\n\nSource: ArDanMe / Shutterstock.com\n\nGerman shoemaker Birkenstock Holding (NYSE:BIRK), best known for its signature sandals, only went public last fall. However, since then, BIRK stock has gained 25% to trade at $45 per share, making it one of the more successful initial public offerings (IPOs) of the last two years. The company, founded in 1774, is starting to come out with its earnings and the results are impressive. In February, Birkenstock reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 that exceeded Wall Street expectations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported a 22% year-over-year jump in its revenue, saying it benefited from higher pricing and rising demand in America. Excluding one-time items, Birkenstock reported a profit of 17 million euros ($18.46 million USD). That was also better than analysts had forecast for the shoemaker. Wall Street sees more gains ahead as Birkenstock gets its footing and its sales accelerate, not only in the U.S., but across Europe and in the key market of China.\n\nThe company is also benefitting from growth in its direct sales channels, noting that its direct-to-consumer sales now account for 53% of total revenue.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of analysts have taken a shine to Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) now that the company has put last fall’s strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) behind it. Since January, F stock has gained 11% and shares can currently be purchased for less than $14. Ford’s stock also looks cheap, trading at just 12 times future earnings estimates. And the automaker pays a generous quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share, which is good for a strong yield of 4.43%. Plus, Ford is known for paying special, one-time dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, Ford paid a special dividend of 18 cents a share in addition to its first-quarter regular dividend. Ford’s leadership team announced they are slowing electric vehicle production, pivoting to gas-electric hybrids, which are currently more in demand. The company is delaying or canceling $12 billion in planned spending on new electric vehicles due to shifting market conditions as well as difficulties in profitably building the cars, trucks and SUVs.\n\nFord has pushed back production of a new all-electric three-row SUV until 2027 and put off plans for a new fully electric pick-up truck that it had codenamed “T3.” The market seems to have taken this change of strategy in stride. Since the switch to hybrid vehicles was announced, F stock has rallied.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group (AAL) An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts like American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), another stock that investors can be buy right now for less than $14. The largest carrier in the world, American Airlines is still recovering from the ravages of the pandemic. Today, AAL stock is trading 60% lower than where it was in 2019 before the Covid-19 crisis. The shares also look undervalued trading at 11 times future earnings forecasts. Unfortunately, American doesn’t pay a dividend. But there’s still a strong buy-the-dip opportunity with the stock.\n\nTravel demand around the world is back above pre-pandemic levels and the number of travelers this year is forecast to hit record levels. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 4.7 billion people are expected to travel in 2024 compared with 4.5 billion in 2019 before the pandemic. And American flies more passengers a year than any other carrier. The company’s earnings have been coming in strong lately, sending shares higher and providing another reason to buy AAL stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Meta Platforms unveiled details on Wednesday about the next generation of the company's in-house artificial intelligence accelerator chip.\n\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\n\nReuters reported earlier this year that Meta planned to deploy a new version of a custom data center chip to address the swelling amount of computing power necessary to run AI products in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The chip, referred to internally as \"Artemis,\" will help Meta reduce its reliance on Nvida's AI chips and reduce its energy costs overall.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"This chip’s architecture is fundamentally focused on providing the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for serving ranking and recommendation models,\" the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nThe new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip is part of a broad custom silicon effort at the company that includes looking at other hardware systems too. Beyond building the chips and hardware, Meta has made significant investments in developing the software necessary to harness the power of its infrastructure in the most efficient way.\n\nThe company is also spending billions on buying Nvidia and other AI chips: This year CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to acquire roughly 350,000 flagship H100 chips from Nvidia. Combined with other suppliers, Meta plans to accumulate the equivalent of 600,000 H100 chips this year, he said.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co will produce the new chip on its \"5nm\" process. Meta said it is capable of three times the performance of its first generation processor.\n\nWHAT IS NEXT\n\nThe chip has been deployed in the data center and is engaged in serving AI applications. The company said it has several programs underway \"aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support of (generative AI) workloads.\"\n\n(Reporting by Max A. Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Reese)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is deploying a new homegrown chip to help power its artificial intelligence services, aiming to decrease its reliance on semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. and other outside companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nThe chip, announced Wednesday, is the latest version of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA, which helps rank and recommend content across Facebook and Instagram. Meta released the first MTIA product last year.\n\nMeta’s pivot to AI services has brought increased demand for computing power. Last year, the social media giant released its own version of an AI model to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It also added new generative AI features to its social apps, including customized stickers and celebrity-faced chatbot characters.\n\nIn October, the company said it would spend as much as $35 billion on infrastructure to support AI, including data centers and hardware. “AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told investors that month.\n\nA significant amount of that spending will likely still flow to Nvidia, which builds the popular H100 graphics cards that power AI models. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said the company would acquire 350,000 of those chips, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nBut there’s a growing movement among tech giants to develop chips in-house. Meta is joining rivals Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in trying to wean themselves off a very expensive dependency. It won’t be a quick fix, though. So far, the efforts haven’t made a dent in the industry’s insatiable need for Nvidia’s AI accelerators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI boom has helped turn Nvidia into the world’s third-most-valuable tech company, behind only Microsoft and Apple Inc. Its sales to data center operators totaled $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024, up from just $15 billion the year before. Analysts predict that the sum will more than double again in fiscal 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Meta Advertisers Say Automated System Has Been Glitchy for Weeks",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Businesses that rely on Facebook and Instagram advertising to stay afloat have noticed something startling over the past two months: Meta Platforms Inc.’s normally reliable ad system is faltering.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nSocial networking juggernaut Meta, which uses algorithms to automatically determine when and where to most effectively show advertising messages across its various apps, has been hammered by major performance issues, according to numerous marketers. The cost of running ad campaigns is up significantly, while results are mixed and ensuing sales are down — and there has been no formal explanation from the company, ad buyers say.\n\n“It’s brutal out there,” Cody Plofker, chief marketing officer at makeup brand Jones Road Beauty, said on the Operators podcast last week. “There is something just terribly broken about Meta right now.”\n\nOne media buyer, who asked not to be identified to preserve relationships at Meta, said that all the major metrics used to determine the cost of a digital ad campaign have gone up significantly. The cost per 1,000 ad impressions — views by potential customers — is up by a factor of two or three in the last couple of months. Cost per click, which calculates how much an advertiser ends up paying each time someone clicks on a link in an ad, has risen by about the same proportion. Several other marketers described similar jumps, though each campaign cost is slightly different.\n\nThose more expensive ad campaigns are cutting into businesses’ profits. A marketer’s return on advertising spending, known in the industry as ROAS, has also notably fallen for several advertisers. Carly London, who runs an agency called Sometimes Curly and manages more than $100 million in Meta-related advertising spending per year, said she saw a 20% to 40% drop in ROAS for a few of her accounts over the past two months without any explanation. In practice, that means that a marketer used to making $3 in revenue for every $1 spent on Facebook ads would suddenly be making closer to $2 in revenue — a meaningful difference when brands rely on predictable results to budget and manage product inventory.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Normally you can find some new creative winners, try a new campaign structure, try some different strategies and kind of find some winners,” said London, who added that not all of her accounts were impacted. “We tested all these things and still have struggled to recover.”\n\nRok Hladnik, whose Flat Circle agency manages several million dollars in Meta-related advertising spending each month, said the past few months have been an outlier for his clients, too. “What we’re seeing right now is definitely on another level,” he said.\n\nMeta acknowledged that there have been glitches, but disputed the notion that they were widespread. “Our ads system is working as expected for the vast majority of advertisers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We recently fixed a few technical issues and are researching a small amount of additional reports from advertisers to ensure the best possible results for businesses using our apps.” The media site Modern Retail previously reported on some of the ad-system problems.Advertising Machine\n\nMeta has spent years establishing itself as one of the most important digital advertising channels in the world, and its algorithms have been fine-tuned to show people the right ad at just the right time. The company’s platforms, led by Facebook and Instagram, accounted for roughly 22% of the global digital advertising market in 2023, according to the research firm Emarketer, trailing only Google at 27.4%. For many small businesses, advertising on Meta is an essential driver of revenue, especially because of the company’s automated system and the ability to precisely target users, which often lead to more sales and fewer wasted advertising dollars.Meta’s unpredictability the last few months has meant new struggles for advertisers. In response, some have pivoted their budgets to internet competitors like TikTok or Alphabet Inc.’s Google. London, who’s still bullish on Meta and says that the ad performance for some of her clients just recently improved, said she had pulled back spending from Facebook and Instagram and instead tested new platforms, like Snap Inc.’s Snapchat and Pinterest Inc. Plofker, too, said he cut his Meta budgets by 30% to 40% and moved money to Google’s YouTube, TikTok and television.\n\n“This is an amazing time to be Google or TikTok,” one advertiser said, adding that the friction at Meta “is the best marketing campaign they could ever hope for.”\n\nThe biggest head-scratcher has been the lack of a formal explanation for the issues, leaving ad buyers theorizing and speculating inside industry group chats and text threads. In private conversations, some Meta employees who serve as sales reps and points of contact for marketing partners have blamed the issues on Temu, the Chinese e-commerce giant, according to two advertisers, who asked not to be identified relaying the discussions.\n\nTemu has been on a marketing blitz since spending millions of dollars on six Super Bowl ads in February. The retailer, owned by PDD Holdings Inc., spent nearly $2 billion on Meta ads in 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal, making it the social media company’s largest advertiser. Some other marketers are speculating that Temu’s spending with Meta has been even heavier since the Super Bowl ads.Ad CompetitionSpending big on social media in the wake of a major television campaign, which would be a common strategy, could theoretically offer an explanation for inconsistent prices and performance for other advertisers on the platform. If Temu is spending a lot of money on Meta using its automated system, it could create unusually high competition, driving up ad-auction prices. It’s also possible that Temu’s lower prices — the site is known for cheap products and fast shipping — could simply be taking away sales from competitors.\n\nNot everyone believes that theory, though. Even at $2 billion a year, Temu’s spending would represent just 1.5% of Meta’s total business last year, and Meta’s global advertising business is so big that it’s hard for many to fathom a single entity creating a lasting impact on the entire system. In an email, a representative for Temu said the company has not noticed any advertising issues with Meta, and declined to comment on its marketing spend. Other buyers theorize that Meta is simply dealing with technical issues it hasn’t been able to resolve, pointing to recent outages at the company. On the podcast, Plofker said that Meta engineers have spent more than 100 hours looking into issues related to his accounts and “haven’t found a bug.”\n\nNo matter the reason, marketers remain frustrated. It’s also unclear whether the recent friction is hurting Meta’s business, but the company is set to report its first-quarter earnings near the end of April. Analysts project revenue of $36.1 billion, or growth of 26% from the same period last year.\n\n“The challenging thing, you know, is Meta doesn’t know what’s happening,” Plofker said. “So this could get better in two weeks, this could get better in a month, this could be the new normal. You really don’t know.”\n\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Meta Trades at a Discount to Magnificent Seven After $1 Trillion AI Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.’s record-breaking, artificial intelligence-fueled rally has added $1 trillion in market value since its darkest days of 2022, and yet by some perspectives it’s still trading at a discount.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Apple’s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Billion in China Shift US Core CPI Tops Forecasts Again, Likely Delaying Fed Rate Cuts\n\nIts shares traded at 24 times estimated earnings early Wednesday, roughly in line with their 10-year average and just below the 25 times of the Nasdaq 100. Among the Magnificent Seven group of big tech companies, only Alphabet Inc., with a multiple of about 21, is cheaper.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the biggest driver of gains and the largest future tailwind investors see for the stock. Meta has been heavily investing in AI to improve ad targeting and recommend content to its massive user base, a bet investors see paying off big time. Profits tripled in the social media giant’s most recent quarterly report while revenue growth surged. The earnings were so strong that Meta also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend.\n\n“Outside of chip or hardware companies like Nvidia or Dell, no company has benefited more from AI than Meta, just in terms of the impact on growth,” said Conrad van Tienhoven, a portfolio manager at Riverpark Capital. “There’s been a clear shift in Meta’s ability to target and measure ads through AI, and executing on this has set the company up for another five to seven years of growth.”\n\nMeta has soared more than 450% from its nadir almost 18 months ago, including a gain of about 46% this year that’s behind only chipmaker Nvidia Corp. among the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe selloff that preceded the current rebound erased more than three-fourths of Meta’s valuation and featured a historic wipeout in market value, largely due to concerns over spending on the its metaverse initiative. While the Menlo Park, California-based company continues to invest in that virtual reality world, it also made cost cuts a focus, dubbing 2023 the “Year of Efficiency.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Meta has figured out how to get rid of unnecessary spending, which has been a real balance sheet plus, and it continues to innovate. If you’re late to the game, there’s always some drawdown risk buying this high, but I don’t see a reason to get out,”said Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanely strategist. “When I look out five or 10 years to where Meta could be, it still looks like a great core holding that is trading at a very favorable price.”\n\nRead More: Magnificent Seven? It’s More Like the Blazing Two and Tepid Five\n\nOf course, investors looking for exposure to ad revenue could also snap up Alphabet, which has a cheaper valuation and has gained about 12% this year, a much more modest performance than Meta’s rally. Though Wall Street is bullish on both names, average price targets signal that analysts see slightly more upside for Alphabet at current levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, Alphabet continues to face investor skepticism over its AI products and ability to translate them to growth. Meta is expected to deliver bigger revenue gains this year, with estimates at 17%, compared with 12% for Alphabet. Net earnings growth at Meta is expected to be roughly twice as strong.\n\nRBC Capital Markets wrote that Meta is “clearly outperforming” Alphabet, its biggest rival in the market for digital advertising, citing its own analysis of spending in the digital ad industry in an April 3 note. RBC raised its price target on Meta to $600 from $565, saying that its outperformance over Alphabet prompts a higher multiple.\n\nMeta is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings results on April 24 after the market close. Top of mind for investors is ad revenue growth, how AI solutions are working and how the company can monetize products such as Reels.\n\n“I’m dying for updates on all of that,” said Scott Acheychek, CEO of Rex Shares LLC.\n\nMeta’s dominant position has also been put into sharp relief by struggles at its social-media peers. Both Pinterest Inc. and Snap Inc. have reported weak sales, putting the stocks in negative territory for the year, while the newly public Reddit Inc. has failed to generate much excitement from analysts.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik wrote that mid-sized social platforms could be “structurally disadvantaged and too sub-scale to compete” in Meta’s shadow.\n\n“What hope is there for the smaller social players including Reddit to reach engagement, monetization, and profitability levels seen over at Meta — the North Star?” he wrote, starting coverage on Reddit with an underperform rating.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida have enlisted Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. to fund a new joint artificial intelligence research program, as the two nations look to improve collaboration around the quickly emerging technology. Apple Inc. assembled $14 billion of iPhones in India in the last fiscal year, doubling production in a sign it’s accelerating a push to diversify beyond China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in AI development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers. BMW AG’s sales of fully electric vehicles at its core brand surged in the first quarter, outperforming rivals like Tesla and Volkswagen, which have struggled to cope with faltering demand.\n\nEarnings due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 10, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Iron Mountain Inc. IRM, MPLX LP MPLX, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and W. R. Berkley Corp. WRB.\n\n5 High ROE Stocks to Buy as Solid Bond Yields Hit Markets\n\nWith a steady increase in Treasury yields due to sticky inflation data, the broader U.S. equity market witnessed a downward trajectory over the past few trading days. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels since November 2023 and hovered in the vicinity of 4.4%, dragging the equity markets down. Investors began to fret about its probable impact on the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in May, with the odds of a rate cut declining significantly.\n\nThe Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for February was up 0.3% month over month, in line with broad-based expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Core PCE increased 2.8%, way above the Fed's 2% inflation target. Per the Labor Department's latest job report, nonfarm payrolls increased higher than expected to 303,000 in March, signifying robust economic strength. Wages were up 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with estimates.\n\nThe solid economic metrics and high inflationary pressures cast doubts over the Fed's proposed rate cuts this year. Despite the federal funds rate level (in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%) being the highest in more than 23 years, the Fed has kept the rates unchanged while pledging to cut the same thrice in 2024. However, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends owing to tempered expectations and eagerly await further clarity in Fed's next policy meeting.\n\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \"backing and filling\" in the market, they can benefit from \"cash cow\" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Iron Mountain Inc., MPLX LP, PulteGroup, Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and W. R. Berkley Corp. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nStory continues\n\nROE: A Key Metric\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders' Equity\n\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\n\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nHere are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nIron Mountain: Boston, MA-based Iron Mountain provides records & information management services and data center space & solutions in 59 countries. The company primarily generates revenues from storage rental and services. Storage rental revenues are generated through periodic rental charges for data storage.

MPLX also has processing and fractionation facilities for natural gas and natural gas liquids. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.3%, on average. MPLX carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nPulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding – which accounts for the lion's share of revenues, and Financial Services.\n\nPulteGroup has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.7% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.1%, on average.

        "content": "Although Wall Street offers few guarantees, short-term volatility is one of them. Since the curtain opened on 2020, Wall Street's three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years (through 2023).\n\nWhen equities are getting whipsawed by uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to seek the safety of industry-leading stocks, such as the companies that make up the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPatient investors have gravitated to the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. Listed in descending order of current market cap (as of April 5, 2024), these seven titans are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two defining traits that have made the Magnificent Seven such popular holdings for investors. To start with, they're undeniable outperformers. Over the trailing decade, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a rock-solid 182%. Comparatively, Nvidia's stock has zoomed higher by approximately 19,230%, the shares of Amazon and Tesla have gained more than 1,000%, and Alphabet is bringing up the caboose with a gain of \"only\" 464% from its Class A shares (GOOGL). MSFT Chart\n\nThe other reason investors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven is because they all offer clearly defined competitive advantages or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure service platform Azure ranks second in global market share. Meanwhile, Windows remains the clear leader in desktop operating systems. Apple's iPhone has accounted for a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable versions in 2020. Apple also has the largest share repurchase program on Wall Street. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for a 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon sits at the top of the pack in e-commerce and among cloud infrastructure service platforms. Its e-commerce marketplace oversaw nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) gobbled up a 31% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the September-ended quarter. Alphabet's Google has a virtual monopoly in global internet search, with a 91% share in March 2024. Alphabet is also the parent of the second-most-visited social network (YouTube) and the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms' social media networks attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) during the December-ended quarter. This includes Facebook, which alone lured in 3.07 billion MAUs. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's been generating a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced almost 1.85 million EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors have been selling all but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nBut in spite of the overwhelming success of the Magnificent Seven, many of Wall Street's most prominent billionaire investors began kicking these outperformers to the curb during the December-ended quarter.\n\nAll told, six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks were either jettisoned from billionaires' portfolios or meaningfully pared down, including:\n\nNvidia: Eight highly successful billionaire money managers reduced their positions in this AI titan, with Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold), Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold), and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) leading the way. Microsoft: Seven accomplished billionaires were sellers of Microsoft stock in the December-ended quarter, including Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares sold) and Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares sold), who both closed out their respective funds' positions. Alphabet: Seven top-tier billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Alphabet during the fourth quarter. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont (3,302,342 shares sold), Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel (3,113,001 shares sold), and Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman (1,278,300 shares sold) were the respective top sellers. Meta Platforms: Six tenured billionaires gave shares of Meta the boot in the quarter ended in December. The top sellers included Jeff Yass of Susquehanna (3,037,082 shares sold) and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global (1,430,767 shares sold). Apple: Four respected billionaire money managers reduced their stakes in Apple during the fourth quarter. This included Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who oversaw the sale of a little over 10 million shares of Apple. Tesla: A total of three well-known billionaire investors sold shares of EV maker Tesla in the final quarter of 2023. Billionaires John Overdeck and David Siegel, who co-founded Two Sigma Investments, saw their funds sell all 1,015,385 shares of Tesla they'd owned as of the previous quarter.\n\nThe one name missing from this list, and the only Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires are absolutely piling into, is e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the fourth quarter, eight billionaires added shares of Amazon to their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why billionaire investors can't stop buying Amazon stock\n\nIf you're wondering why billionaires are buying shares of Amazon stock while paring down or exiting their stakes in the other Magnificent Seven stocks, look no further than Amazon's trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments: AWS, advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates very low margins. The bulk of the cash flow and operating income Amazon produces come from its trio of ancillary segments.\n\nNone of these segments is more important than AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit sales growth should be the expectation for AWS. Even though this segment only accounted for a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it provided about two-thirds of its operating income.\n\nAmazon's advertising operations are another source of sustained growth. In a typical month, Amazon's website is the destination for well over 2 billion visitors, many of whom are motivated shoppers. This makes Amazon one of the primary platforms that merchants want to target when getting their message(s) in front of consumers.\n\nThe third key operating division is subscription services. The last time Amazon updated its global Prime subscription count was April 2021, when then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company had surpassed 200 million. With Amazon gaining the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, there's a high likelihood this subscription total has jumped further.\n\nCollectively, the lure of these higher-growth segments is their cash flow generation. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock. Patient investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for just 13 times consensus cash flow in 2025. Even approaching its previous all-time high, Amazon stock is historically inexpensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven,\" All Eyes Should Be on the \"Fab Four\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the broader market last year. This group of the world's largest technology companies impressed with 2023 returns ranging between 48% and 238%. That's impressive for companies already worth trillions of dollars in some cases!\n\nBut 2024 has represented a changing of the guard of sorts. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have hit some headwinds. The remaining group of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) continue to rally, resembling a new group, a \"Fab Four\" that continues to carry the market to all-time highs.\n\nCan they continue to separate themselves from the pack?\n\nForget the Magnificent Seven and embrace the Fab Four. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA changing of the guard in 2024\n\nApple, Tesla, and Alphabet haven't kept up the pace since 2024 began. Alphabet's year-to-date gains have \"only\" tracked the S&P 500, while Apple and Tesla have started to slide. Apple and Tesla are reporting hiccups in their growth efforts. Tesla's deliveries began 2024 with a thud, while Apple is dealing with weakness in China, a vital market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Alphabet is experiencing its first threat to its monopoly on search engine traffic from generative artificial intelligence (AI). AAPL Chart\n\nThese massive companies can't maintain these tremendous investment returns if they don't deliver the performance to back up those high expectations. Analysts have dramatically soured on Tesla's near-term growth outlook, and Apple's valuation got too hot for the growth it was putting on the table.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" enjoy growth tailwinds\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven form the Fab Four, thanks primarily to expected tailwinds from artificial intelligence over the coming years. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, which are needed to power the massive computer systems that run AI. Amazon and Microsoft operate the world's two largest cloud platforms, the underpinnings of the internet, and what will be various AI applications. Lastly, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI for digital advertising while investing heavily in augmented reality.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth these opportunities will create, calling for annualized long-term earnings growth ranging from 15% to 35% over the next three to five years.\n\nValuations say the momentum can continue\n\nHow much you pay for a stock always matters. It's not that Tesla, Alphabet, and Apple can't succeed in the future, but their valuations have become too disconnected from what the market expects growth to look like.\n\nInvestors can use the PEG ratio to compare a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth to determine whether shares are still a good value. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf you use the data from the above charts, the Fab Four have the following PEG ratios:\n\nNvidia: 1 Amazon: 1.9 Microsoft: 2.4 Meta: 1.3\n\nThe lower the PEG ratio is, the better the value. I generally look to buy when PEG ratios are under 1.5, so Nvidia and Meta remain excellent deals if they can deliver the growth analysts expect from them. Amazon is a bit more expensive but is a more capital-intensive company. If you price the stock to its operating cash flow, its valuation is still below its decade average. Admittedly, Microsoft is beginning to look expensive, so investors may want to think twice before buying shares.\n\nAll the companies in the Magnificent Seven are among the best in their respective industries and could easily be long-term winners. But the cream eventually rises to the top, which could be Nvidia and Meta Platforms based on the numbers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Social Media Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "Due to a hawkish Federal Reserve, social media stocks lost value last year as businesses reduced their ad expenditures. Still, a return to more favorable conditions is anticipated this year. According to IPG Mediabrands, sales will increase by 9.2% in 2024.\n\nIf that wasn’t all, Donald Trump is also acting as a tailwind of sorts. Trump Media (NASDAQ:DJT) is one of the most divisive stocks in the market but with a $5 billion market cap achieved in no time, it’s getting hard to ignore.\n\nAmidst all of this, we have three robust social media purchasing stocks that are traveling in separate directions. One is an industry giant that’s also squandering resources on vanity projects while a second fails to capitalize on the rebound underway in advertising spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast is one languishing heartbroken over the departure of its CEO and founder. All in all, there are exciting times are ahead!\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nThanks to its unrival 3.98 billion monthly active users (MAU), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the dominant social media firm. Yet the billions of dollars it squandered on the metaverse might spoil the party. Even so, Meta Platforms leads social media stocks.\n\nFacebook is the gem in the META crown, with 3.05 billion users as of Q4’23 — a 3.44% increase year over year (YOY). That being said, META’s appeal extends beyond Facebook. With over 2 billion active users, Instagram and WhatsApp are also accessible to stockholders.\n\nIn all, almost 50% of people on Earth utilize social media, and the majority use at least one Meta platform. Furthermore, Meta doesn’t produce any material. Instead, the users create the content, leading to a 54% operating margin in Q4 2023.\n\nFurthermore, after difficult years in 2022 and 2023, ad spending is up from 19.6% in 2021 to single digits in 2023.\n\nThe latest figures from Meta bail out this narrative. Just to put things in perspective, Meta reported $40.1 billion in top-line revenue for Q4 2023, an increase of 25% versus the year-ago period. Out of this total, 98% of revenue is from digital advertising.\n\nBut META’s Reality Labs division is losing money — roughly $50 billion over the last five years — which has many worried that the metaverse might stand in the way of Meta’s success. In my opinion, the media conglomerate can take these losses. Plus, a potential market size of $936.6 billion by 2030 means more growth for META stockholders if it succeeds.\n\nAnalyst sentiment is certainly bullish with a consensus strong buy recommendation and a slight 3% upside to go with it.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap (SNAP) Snapchat (SNAP) logo on phone screen in jean pocket\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSadly, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has to cook bigger fish. Even with abundant advertising money, it finds it difficult to expand revenue. Snap hasn’t taken advantage of the rebound in ad expenditure, with a 31% decline to start 2024 to change hands for just over $11.\n\nUnfortunately, the stock price fell along with the most recent quarterly report in February. In Q4’23, Snap’s sales increased by a pitiful 5% to $1.4 billion. In 2023, the company’s total sales remained at $4.6 billion from the previous year.\n\nSnap’s user base increased by 10% from the previous year to 414 million in Q4 2023, therefore there are some positive developments for investors. In the end, Snap is a growth stock, and if user numbers are rising, investors often don’t care about the losses.\n\nIn addition, Snap is looking to scale recurring revenue options such as the Snapchat+ subscription service, which is a wise choice that could solve the ongoing cash flow problem. On a separate note, Integral Ad Science (NASDAQ:IAS) and Snap are partnering to offer marketers artificial intelligence (AI)-driven brand safety for Snapchat ads. The move will attract Snap’s younger demographic since ESG is a big concern for them.\n\nAnalyst sentiment leads me to believe the AI-focused revamp for Snap might work out. The upside is at 25% based on a $14 target price for Snap.\n\nBumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final entry on our list is Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL), a social media stock at risk due to poor sales projections and Whitney Wolfe Herd’s resignation as CEO and founder.\n\nThere’s little question that it will be felt when the company’s founder leaves after more than a decade in leadership. As seen by the circumstances surrounding Bob Iger and Howard Schultz at Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), respectively, poor handling of these pivotal exits may cause grave pain.\n\nGrowth is Bumble’s other main problem, and investor anxiety is heightened by the company’s gloomy quarterly sales estimate. In the opinion of CEO Lidiane Jones, the firm must appeal to younger consumers to thrive where “true innovation” is missing. That’s why she is revamping the main app and updating the Premium Plus membership to attract more Gen Z users.\n\nBumble is trying to address low user spending by cutting off 350 workers, or around 30% of its workforce. Bumble is also investigating the application of generative AI. With all these factors, plus a 26% drop in price, this women-first, youth-focused company certainly will attract value investors.\n\nAnalysts certainly like to think so, projecting an upside of over 50% to accompany its buy rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 17.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 34.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 24.6%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.7% this year versus the industry average of 7.6%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Will Meta Platforms (META) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Meta Platforms (META), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this social media company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 15.81%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Meta Platforms came out with earnings of $5.33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83 per share, representing a surprise of 10.35%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.62 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.39 per share, delivering a surprise of 21.27%.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.05%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 24, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Intel's latest AI chip is a direct shot at Nvidia's moneymaker",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) on Tuesday debuted a new AI chip designed to take on one of Nvidia’s (NVDA) most popular AI processors as part of its Intel Vision event.\n\nThe company's Gaudi 3 chip matches and exceeds Nvidia’s H100 AI processorwhen it comes to training and deploying generative AI models. The H100 is one of Nvidia's most popular chips, powering artificial intelligence applications for some of the world's biggest tech companies, from Microsoft to Google.\n\nAccording to Intel, the Gaudi 3 is 40% more power efficient with 50% faster inferencing than Nvidia’s H100. Training refers to the time it takes to train an AI foundation model like OpenAI’s GPT-3, while inferencing is the process of actually using the models for apps.\n\nIntel says the Gaudi 3 is up to 1.7 times faster when training common large language models than the H100. Intel even says its chip is an average of 1.3 times faster than Nvidia’s beefier Nvidia H200 when it comes to inferencing certain language models.\n\nIn addition to the Gaudi line of chips and Xeon CPUs, Intel is also marketing so-called AI PCs, computers equipped with neural processing units that can handle onboard AI tasks.\n\nThese AI maneuvers come at a critical time for Intel.\n\nThe company is working to reinvent itself as the leader in sophisticated chip technology while building out its chip manufacturing capabilities in the US and abroad. This includes a foundry business that will build Intel’s own chips as well as those for third-party customers. The company has already confirmed it will build chips for Microsoft.\n\nBut this reinvention is coming at a steep cost, with Intel announcing earlier this month a $7 billion operating loss for 2023 as part of its new financial reporting structure. Intel stock is down 25% so far this year. Rivals Nvidia and AMD (AMD), conversely, are up 15% and 74% so far this year, respectively.\n\nIntel has been teasing the Gaudi 3 chip for some time, with CEO Pat Gelsinger showing off a version of the platform during a December press event. It’s seen as Intel’s best chance yet to compete with Nvidia in the AI market, a space the graphics chip giant dominates thanks to its powerful hardware and software.\n\nStory continues Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger discusses his company's plans to capitalize on the booming demand for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence during a conference in San Jose, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024. (Michael Liedtke/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company's new chips also come just a month after Nvidia debuted its own next-generation AI platform called Blackwell. That system includes Nvidia’s B200 AI chip, which is made up of two Blackwell chips mated together to act as a single processor.\n\nIntel is putting its AI systems forward as an alternative to Nvidia’s offerings, claiming an open-source approach that will allow customers to use the services and software that they want.\n\nAnd while Nvidia is the leader in overall AI technology, Intel is betting enterprises will remain wary of sticking with a single source for high-value needs like AI hardware.\n\nFor instance, hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others already either offer their own AI chips or are developing them in addition to using Nvidia’s chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIntel’s Gaudi 3 will give those hyperscalers another option in the chip market.\n\nIntel also announced on Tuesday a new form of Ethernet connectivity for Gaudi 3 nodes, competing with Nvidia’s InfiniBand connectivity technology to ensure uninterrupted connections and processing. The company also debuted its Xeon 6 processors for use in AI systems.\n\nTaking a page out of Nvidia’s book, Intel is offering the entire setup as a reference design that partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro can use to build their own server cabinets.\n\nIntel says customers will be able to order the Gaudi 3-powered systems in sizes ranging from individual nodes and small boxes to enormous megaclusters that can fill entire data centers.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises",
        "content": "It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.\n\nApple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.\n\nTo that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.\n\nAnd while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.\n\nApple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.\n\nStill, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.\n\nBusiness uses for an expensive headset\n\nDuring my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.\n\nUsers see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body. An Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset is seen at Apple store in New York, United States on Feb. 3, 2024. (Fatih Aktas/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.\n\nLooking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.\n\nThe Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.\n\nThen there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEach of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.\n\nThe Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.\n\nWe’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a “sword and a shield” against harmful content, not just a tool to spread it, Sir Nick Clegg has said.\n\nThe former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister is now the head of global affairs at tech giant Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nSpeaking during an AI event at Meta’s London offices, Sir Nick said that while it was “right” to be “vigilant” about generative AI being used to create disinformation to disrupt elections, he said AI was the “single biggest reason” Meta was getting better at reducing the spread of “bad content” on its platforms.\n\nIn 2024, billions of people are set to go to the polls with elections due in a number of the world’s largest democracies, including the UK, US and India.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt has led some experts to warn of the potential threat posed by the rapid rise of generative AI tools – including image, text and audio content apps – and the possibility of them being used to spread misinformation and disinformation with the aim of disrupting democratic processes.\n\nA number of senior UK politicians have already been the subjects of so-called deepfakes, which have spread on social media.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, fact-checking charity Full Fact said the UK was currently vulnerable to misinformation, and more government intervention was needed on the issue with elections on the horizon.\n\nSir Nick said focus on the issue was important, but argued that good AI was potent protection against bad AI, and that Meta and others had the tools needed to fight the spread of harmful material.\n\n“I would urge everyone – yes, there are risks – but to also think of AI as a sword, not just a shield, when it comes to bad content,” he said.\n\n“If you look at Meta, the world’s largest social media platform, the single biggest reason why we’re getting better and better in reducing the bad content that we don’t want on Instagram and Facebook is for one reason; AI.”\n\nHe added that the use of AI to scan Meta’s platforms to find and remove harmful content had reduced the levels of bad content by “50 to 60% over the last two years” meaning that now “for every 10,000 bits of content, one bit of content might be hate speech”.\n\nStory continues Left to right, Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, Nick Clegg, President, Global Affairs, Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist, Joelle Pineau, Vice President, AI Research and Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Meta’s AI event in London (David Parry Media Assignments/PA)\n\n“Some of the work teams have been doing inside Meta to improve the way that we use our most advanced AI tools to triage content, so that we make sure that the 40,000 people we have working on content moderation really look at the most acute edge cases and they don’t waste a lot of their time looking at stuff that is inoffensive or not a problem has really improved rapidly in recent months,” he said.\n\n“It is right that there is an increasingly high level of industry wide cooperation, particularly this year because of this unprecedented number of elections.\n\n“We should be vigilant, but I would urge you to also think of AI as a great tool to navigate that difficult landscape and I’m quietly optimistic that the whole industry is trying to really lean into this as cooperatively as possible.”\n\nDuring the event, Sir Nick also announced that Meta’s next AI large language model – used to power AI tools, including chatbots built by Meta and other firms – would be released shortly.\n\nSir Nick said the new model, known as Llama 3, would begin to roll out “within the next month, hopefully less” and would continue over the course of the year.",

        "title": "5 High ROE Stocks to Buy as Solid Bond Yields Hit Markets",
        "content": "With a steady increase in Treasury yields due to sticky inflation data, the broader U.S. equity market witnessed a downward trajectory over the past few trading days. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels since November 2023 and hovered in the vicinity of 4.4%, dragging the equity markets down. Investors began to fret about its probable impact on the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting in May, with the odds of a rate cut declining significantly.\r\n\r\nThe Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for February was up 0.3% month over month, in line with broad-based expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Core PCE increased 2.8%, way above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Per the Labor Department’s latest job report, nonfarm payrolls increased higher than expected to 303,000 in March, signifying robust economic strength. Wages were up 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with estimates.\r\n\r\nThe solid economic metrics and high inflationary pressures cast doubts over the Fed’s proposed rate cuts this year. Despite the federal funds rate level (in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%) being the highest in more than 23 years, the Fed has kept the rates unchanged while pledging to cut the same thrice in 2024. However, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends owing to tempered expectations and eagerly await further clarity in Fed’s next policy meeting.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, MPLX LP MPLX, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and W. R. Berkley Corporation WRB are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nStory continues\n\nROE: A Key Metric\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow.

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bonanza: 7 Stocks to Surf the April Upswing",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks offer more stability than most stocks. Corporations in this category are profitable, and some of them are still growing at good rates.\n\nWhile the year started off strong, March was a bit slower. The S&P 500 only gained 3% during the month while it gained 5% in February. An April upswing can move blue-chip stocks higher.\n\nIt’s nice to see stocks move higher in one month, but investors should prioritize what a stock will look like after a few years. These blue-chip stocks exhibit promising signs that indicate they have more room for long-term gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a steady record of outperforming the stock market and delivering gains for shareholders. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and offers a 0.71% dividend yield.\n\nThe company’s dominance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries has prompted many analysts to feel bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests an 11% upside. Microsoft is also rated as a “Strong Buy” among 35 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 29% gain from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft Azure continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. This major catalyst grew by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 and contributed to more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue. Cloud computing has also helped Microsoft expand its profit margins. That has led to a lower P/E ratio and high dividend hikes each year. The rising demand of artificial intelligence should increase Microsoft Cloud’s runway.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is an enticing dividend growth stock thanks to its valuation, consistent financial growth, and high-profit margins. The stock has a 20 P/E ratio and a 1.26% dividend yield. American Express recently announced a 17% dividend hike amid good financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 23% year-over-year. American Express also announced that it intends on generating 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects EPS growth rates to range in the mid-teens during the same time.\n\nThese announcements are a part of the company’s growth plan which started in January 2022. American Express generated record revenue and profits in 2023 by adding 12.2 million new cards over the past year. The number of “cards-in-force” issued exceeds 140 million. People will use their credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express offers more insulation than many corporations when the economy slows down.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is an emerging athletic apparel brand that is stealing market share from top competitors. The company’s Hoka and Ugg brands have been a big hit with consumers. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach a record $1.56 billion. The company’s fiscal 2024 revenue guidance suggests it will generate 14% more sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company’s profits grew by 40% year-over-year and helped Deckers Outdoor secure a 25% net profit margin. Ugg has been doing most of the work and reached $1.072 billion in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hola came in second with $429.3 million in revenue but is growing at a faster rate. Ugg brand net sales increased by 15.2% year-over-year while Hoka brand net sales grew by 21.9% year-over-year.\n\nDeckers Outdoor has received more attention ever since it was added to the S&P 500. Even before its inclusion, the stock has comfortably outperformed the market by delivering a 480% gain over the past five years.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells essential home care and grooming products that won’t go out of style during an economic bust. The stock has only delivered a 49% gain over the past five years which is below the S&P 500’s gains during the same time period. However, this blue-chip stock doesn’t experience as much volatility.\n\nPG stock only has a 0.43 beta compared to the S&P 500’s 1.00 beta. Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility. While many growth investors want to forget 2022, Procter & Gamble only lost 7% of its value during that year. The company’s 2.41% dividend yield helped to offset some of those losses.\n\nSpeaking of the dividend, it’s one of the most reliable payouts in the market. Procter & Gamble has distributed dividends for 133 consecutive years. The includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Procter & Gamble has the flexibility to raise prices during inflation and reward long-term investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in the e-commerce industry. Amazon’s vast logistics network makes it easy for most people to receive any product within 1-2 days. The tech giant also has same-day shipping available at some locations.\n\nThe company has a deep moat for its online marketplace, and that competitive advantage resulted in record revenue in Q4 2023. Amazon increased its net sales by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon grew its international revenue by 17% year-over-year while revenue from North America was up by 13% year-over-year.\n\nAmazon also has a competitive moat with its cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services exhibited a 13% year-over-year growth rate to reach $24.2 billion. The company is also expanding into advertising, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. These growth opportunities can result in higher revenue growth and rising profit margins. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has plenty of fans on Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another blue-chip stock to consider after the social media giant has rented its focus on rising profit margins. Analysts have cheered on the company’s recent results and currently view the company as a “Strong Buy.” The highest price target of $609 per share suggests a 16% upside from the current price.\n\nThe stock has been getting more attention due to its recent dividend. Meta Platforms announced its first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth and 201% year-over-year net income growth in that quarter. The dividend was the icing on the cake.\n\nMany advertisers flock to Meta Platforms to reach more of their potential customers. The company has a comfortable lead over other social networks. A TikTok ban would push Meta Platforms higher up on its pedestal. Meta Platforms doesn’t need a controversial TikTok ban to gain market share, but it is a catalysts that investors should monitor.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) offers stability since many people will use credit and debit cards during various economic cycles. These plastic cards are more convenient than carrying around spare change and can also help with credit building (credit cards only) and have enticing rewards programs.\n\nYou aren’t earning 2% cashback if you use paper cash for your purchases, and credit cards let you access money that you currently don’t have. These financial products can put you into a lot of debt, but they are useful for many people.\n\nVisa has been using this formula to deliver impressive returns for shareholders. The stock has gained 7% year-to-date and is up by 74% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.75% dividend yield and has a compounded annual growth rate of 18.18% over the past five years. The stock only has a 21.50% dividend payout ratio, which suggests it has plenty of room to increase its distributions.\n\nThe fintech company also boasts solid financials. Visa reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, DECK, and AMZN.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia urged Facebook operator Meta and short video service TikTok to step up monitoring on their platforms, it said on Tuesday, with the government reporting sharp increases in harmful social media content this year.\n\nIn the first three months of 2024, the government referred 51,638 cases to social media platforms, including Meta and TikTok, for further action, up from 42,904 cases recorded in the whole of last year, the communications regulator and Malaysian police said in a joint statement.\n\nThe agencies did not specify what types of content were reported, but said the move was part of efforts to restrict the spread of harmful content online, particularly those related to race, religion and royalty.\n\nTikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, and Meta were also urged to curb content indicating coordinated inauthentic behaviour, or related to financial scams and illegal online gambling, the agencies said.\n\nRace and religion are sensitive issues in Malaysia, which has a mainly Muslim ethnic Malay majority, alongside significant ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities. It also has laws prohibiting seditious remarks or insults against its monarchy.\n\nMalaysia has increased scrutiny of online content in recent months, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration facing accusations of backpedaling on its promises to protect free speech. The government has denied allegations of stifling diverse views, saying it needed to protect users from online harms.\n\nMeta and TikTok restricted a record number of social media posts and accounts in Malaysia in the first six months of 2023, amid an increase in government requests to remove content, data published by the firms last year showed.\n\n(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best penny stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nThe markets were off to an impressive start in 2024, driven by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will embark on interest rate cuts. However, data is now showing that inflation remains sticky and the labor market tight, causing new concerns regarding the Fed's possible path towards rate cuts. In this environment it makes sense to look towards masters of the money game.\n\nKen Griffin is one of the hedge fund managers well-positioned to benefit from the ever-evolving financial landscape. The mastermind behind Citadel Investment Group, which he founded in 1990 with $4.2 million, continues to experience a surge in success. The legendary investor set a record with a remarkable return of 153% in 2022 as he got everything right with his strategic bets on inflation and interest rates.\n\nWith a portfolio value of over $460 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street's most tracked hedge funds, consistently surpassing 25% annual returns since 2016. While the hedge fund operates several portfolio funds, its lead fund is Wellington, which invests in various asset classes and sectors as part of its diversification strategy.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin’s flagship Wellington fund delivered 38% returns above the 26% returns that it delivered in 2021, upon topping the 24% gain in 2020. The fund was also up 19.4% in 2019, more than double the 9.1% gain in 2018.\n\nGriffin's hedge fund deploys a multi-strategy investing method that allows it to take advantage of long and short-term investment opportunities. In 2023, when the hedge fund industry came under immense pressure and ended up averaging a 4.4% gain, Citadel outperformed the entire industry, delivering solid returns of 15.3%.\n\nThe flagship fund had an excellent start to 2024, achieving a 1.9% increase in the first month as all employed strategies across commodities, equities, fixed income, credit, and quantitative sectors yielded positive results. Griffin expects the momentum to continue throughout the year as he remains bullish about the US economy amid the expected interest rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Federal Reserve can start cutting rates this summer, and we will see unemployment increase slightly. But the overall economy looks pretty damn good right now,” Griffin said at the MFA Network event in Miami. “This is a real change in mindset from where we were September, October last year.”\n\nCitadel Group generated a profit of $7 billion in 2023. Nevertheless, it was an underperformance, considering a 38% profit jump in 2022 to $16 billion. Similarly, Citadel Investment Group has kept its tradition of returning significant value to shareholders. It has returned over $25 billion since 2018.\n\nGriffin's impressive performance in the market has everything to do with his focus on large-cap, high-growth stocks. Citadel Investment Group boasts significant holding in the magnificent 7 stocks led by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stocks posted double-digit gains in 2023.\n\nAmid the aggressive investment style focusing on high-growth technology stocks, Griffin is also a value investor who often looks for opportunities in small-cap and penny stocks. With a net worth of $35 billion, the billionaire investor employs 18,000 people to scan the best high-risk reward opportunities. 13 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned billionaire Griffin's portfolio and picked 13 penny stocks he's holding.

        "content": "There are few figures in the financial world that have captured the attention of retail investors like Cathie Wood. This is where Cathie Wood stocks come in, whether they’re seen as bad or good.\n\nAs the founder and CEO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood has become renowned for the disruptive innovation platform. While often criticized by others, some of her transformative streams like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency are starting to gain traction. Although some of her investment ideas are questionable, there exists a select few that can deliver outsized returns for investors.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top three Cathie Wood stocks to turn $10,000 into $50,000 by 2028!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a pioneer in robotics process automation (RPA). RPA utilizes software robots for automotive repetitive tasks, promising significant efficiency gains and cost reductions. Cathie Wood is a strong believer in UiPath, holding a large position in the company’s various exchange-traded funds (ETF).\n\nUiPath is flying under the radar and holds a lot of promise as the AI software market continues to advance. In an era where businesses are increasingly embracing automation to stay ahead, their platform offers a compelling value proposition. They also have a broad appeal and diverse clientele across industries such as finance, healthcare and manufacturing. The success and implementation of RPA is steadily growing and hinge on effective change management in organizations. Moreover, the company has seen rapid revenue growth since their IPO in 2021 and just had their first profitable quarter as a public company in Q4 FY24. As automation becomes an essential part of the business process, UiPath remains a contender for the best Cathie Wood stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is an AI company focusing on big data analytics and one of the top Cathie Wood stocks to buy now. The company’s AI growth prospects and flip to profitability has made them one of the most raved about companies on Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir has positioned itself at the forefront of big data analytics, offering powerful tools and solutions for businesses and governments. In an increasingly data-driven world, the need for such services has been unprecedented. While the company is mainly targeting government agencies, their AIP platform is set to be a huge catalyst for long term growth and profitability. Palantir has continued to grow its commercial presence, with commercial revenue up 70% year over year (YOY) in Q4 2023. CEO Alex Karp is maintaining focus on driving profitable growth, while continuing to diversify away from their core business. With an anticipated S&P 500 inclusion in 2024, Palantir is well-positioned to deliver substantial returns for investors.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) A concept image of the metaverse with two young adults wearing virtual reality headsets. undervalued metaverse stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a global social media giant that owns notable subsidiaries such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. While Cathie Wood’s investment is on the smaller side, she believes the company is strategically positioned to lead the metaverse and VR world.\n\nMeta Platform’s investments in virtual reality (VR) technology and its Oculus VR platform are central to this vision. The company has invested nearly $50 billion in the metaverse since 2019 and plans to increase capital expenditures in 2024. Aside from their metaverse bets, Meta is ramping up their investments into generative AI. They announced the release of their large language model (LLM), Llama 3, set for July 2024. This will be a game-changer, competing directly with Gemini and ChatGPT, as well as creating new AI features in the metaverse. Furthermore, Meta’s free cash flow (FCF) has ballooned in the last year and business is booming as the company announced their first ever dividend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation",
        "content": "Technology stocks have driven the S&P 500 higher over the past year or so, leading the index out of bear territory and to a record high earlier this year, confirming we are indeed in a bull market. These types of markets favor growth stocks, so it's likely technology players will hold onto the momentum and climb higher in the months to come.\n\nSome already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.)\n\nLet's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared more than 200% over the past year on optimism about its dominance in the AI chip market. The company holds about 80% share, and thanks to its increases in research and development spending, and its pledge to continue releasing more and more powerful chips, its leadership is likely to last.\n\nJust recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year.\n\nAmong these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's chip dominance has helped its earnings to soar over the past few years, and in the most recent quarter, revenue and net income rose in the triple digits. Considering this track record and the strengths I mention above, the stock seems reasonably priced at 34 times forward-earnings estimates today.\n\n2. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) shares have climbed more than 130% in a year as the company emerges from a period of cost cuts and ramps up investment in growth. And this growth includes a focus on AI, Meta's biggest investment area this year.\n\nYou probably know Meta more for its social media platforms than for its presence in the world of AI. The company owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and every day more than 3.1 billion people use at least one of these apps. Meta has a rock-solid moat, or competitive advantage, thanks to this brand strength, and that keeps its biggest source of revenue -- advertisers -- coming back to reach users of these apps.\n\nThis has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend.\n\nMeta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has advanced about 70% over the past year as the company emerges from a difficult period and shows it has what it takes to win over the long term.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade.\n\nMoving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term.\n\nThat's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Hit an All-Time High and Could Soar a Lot More, According to 4 Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Is the \"magnificence\" fading? Tesla's shares have plunged nearly 45% from their 52-week high. Apple stock is down nearly 15% from its recent high. Even Nvidia has retreated 10% from its peak.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) just hit an all-time high and could soar a lot more, according to four Wall Street analysts.\n\nMeta has come roaring back\n\nIt wasn't all that long ago that many investors had seemingly given up on Meta. In 2022, the company's earnings growth was anemic. Some viewed Facebook as yesterday's news with ByteDance's TikTok on the rise. Skepticism was high, to say the least, about CEO Mark Zuckerberg's big bet on building the metaverse.\n\nAfter an especially disappointing quarterly update in February 2022, Meta's share price plunged 26% in one day, wiping out $251 billion of the company's market cap. In the stock market's history, no company had lost that much value on a dollar basis in a single trading day. By November 2022, Meta's shares were down 75% below the previous high.\n\nThat was then. Meta is now on a roll -- a huge one. Since bottoming out in late 2022, the social media stock has skyrocketed over 450%. Meta's shares are up close to 49% so far this year.\n\nWhat happened to turn things around? The same thing that nearly always drives stocks higher: impressive earnings growth and expectations of strong future expansion. It also didn't hurt that generative AI became the King Midas of the modern-day stock market, turning practically everything it touched into investing gold.\n\nMeta has strong upside potential\n\nCan Meta's major momentum continue? At least four analysts think so.\n\nJefferies recently raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $585 from $550. RBC Capital Markets also upped its price target for Meta to $600 from $565, reflecting a potential upside of 14%. Two other analysts are on the same page as RBC. Wells Fargo and First Shanghai also set price targets of $600 for Meta. Meta currently trades at around $526 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile not quite as bullish about Meta as the other Wall Street pros, Jefferies analysts are decidedly enthusiastic about the stock. They wrote in a note to investors last week that \"Meta has too many advantages to count.\"\n\nJefferies analysts believe Meta could snag as much as half of total incremental advertising spending in 2024. If they're right, it would be an impressive performance, especially considering the gains Amazon has made in the digital advertising market.\n\nIs Meta stock a buy?\n\nWall Street pros don't know what the future holds any more than you or I do. It's possible that Meta won't come close to delivering the kind of gains analysts predict over the next 12 months. However, I think Wall Street's optimism about the stock is warranted over the long term.\n\nFacebook remains much more resilient than many might have expected a few years ago. The social media platform had 2.11 billion average daily active users in December 2023, up 6% year over year. Across all of Meta's platforms, the average daily active user count was 3.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior-year period.\n\nMeta continues to do a great job at monetizing this massive global audience. Ad impressions have risen. Facebook and Instagram Reels have become a key revenue source. Business messaging on WhatsApp is a big growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to help advertisers automate their ad campaigns.\n\nZuckerberg thinks it's possible that smart glasses with built-in AI assistants could be a \"killer app.\" He also reiterated that Meta plans to roll out functionality including holograms and a sense of presence for its smart glasses in the future.\n\nMeta intends to incorporate artificial general intelligence (AGI) into its products as well. In the company's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg said, \"We're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember, and many other cognitive capabilities in order to provide the best versions of the services we envision.\"\n\nI won't be surprised if Meta's shares pull back somewhat over the next year like some of its Magnificent Seven peers have. But I fully expect this stock to be a magnificent winner for investors over the next decade and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $539,230!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 25 biggest internet companies in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Biggest Internet Companies in the US.\n\nThe Power of the Internet\n\nThe internet has become an indispensable tool in today’s world. It plays a crucial role in connecting people worldwide, facilitating communication, and enabling access to vast amounts of information. It has revolutionized how we work, learn, and interact, making tasks more efficient and convenient.\n\nAccording to the estimates provided by Internet World Stats for the year 2023, there are over 5.3 billion internet users worldwide, resulting in a global internet penetration rate of 67.9%. The internet has become an essential tool for businesses, education, research, and entertainment. It offers a wide variety of leisure activities, such as watching movies, listening to songs, chatting, playing games, and surfing for the latest news and entertainment updates.\n\nAdditionally, the internet has made shopping more convenient, with the ability to purchase a wide range of products and services online, eliminating the need for physical queues and agents. As reported by the US Census Bureau, e-commerce sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 accounted for 15.6% of total sales in the US, representing a 7.5% increase from the same period in 2022.\n\nA Look at Some of the Biggest Internet Companies\n\nSome of the biggest players in the digital space are Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nAmazon.com Inc.

Here are some comments from Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\nStory continues\n\n“We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce’s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart. Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), like other internet companies, is focusing on implementing various strategies to maintain its market presence and drive growth. User preferences for internet entertainment are constantly changing and there's a belief that future entertainment will be heavily video-based. On April 3, Meta Platforms Inc.

The new player features a consistent design for all video lengths and includes new controls such as a fullscreen mode for horizontal videos, a slider to skip around in longer videos, and the ability to tap on the video to bring up additional options for pausing, rewinding, or forwarding 10-seconds. The updated player also offers improved recommendations for videos of all lengths based on users' interests, providing a more personalized and engaging viewing experience. The new video player is being rolled out on iOS and Android in the US and Canada. It will be launched globally in the coming months.\n\nThe internet continues to transform how content is created, distributed, and consumed. Netflix Inc.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "You generally don't want to mindlessly copy someone else's portfolio, because different strategies work better for different investors. Not everyone has the same investment style, risk tolerance, financial goals, or time horizon. That said, there is nothing wrong with looking to investors -- especially ones with proven success -- for investment ideas.\n\nThere are two billionaires in particular, Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood, that investors often look to for inspiration. If you're looking for a few stocks owned by the billionaire investors to add to your portfolio, the following three are great options. These stocks are owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) or Wood's ARK Invest.\n\n1. Visa\n\nAlthough Visa accounts for a small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, it's one of the more surefire blue-chip stocks the Buffett-run company owns.\n\nVisa's competitive advantage (and why it's one of my favorite stocks) is its vast reach. There are more than 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation, and it's accepted by more than 130 million merchants globally. Both of those far exceed the runner-up, Mastercard. Visa's reach is also constantly expanding because of the network effect.\n\nAs a merchant, you're more willing to accept Visa cards because you understand they are the most common cards, and not accepting them could mean plenty of missed sales. As a potential cardholder, you're incentivized to go with Visa because you know it's the most accepted card globally. It's a win-win for the payment processing giant.\n\nThis network effect and organic growth also help Visa operate with margins that are hard to find at any company, regardless of industry. Its gross profit margin is routinely about 80%. For perspective, here's how it compares to other market leaders from various industries. V Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nVisa is well positioned to continue its market dominance. It has great brand recognition and a global reach, and will be a main beneficiary of the world's shift toward digital payments.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is a stock held in Wood's popular ARK Innovation ETF and it's a member of the influential \"Magnificent Seven.\" You could also argue that Meta is currently the best value of that esteemed group of companies, even after surging more than 130% in the past 12 months.\n\nMeta has faced its fair share of problems during the past few years from a public relations standpoint, as well as a slowdown in advertising spending that inevitably took a toll on its revenue. The latter is important because Meta relies on advertising for close to 98% of its revenue. However, a more optimistic economic outlook and increased ad spending have taken the company's financials up to another level in the past year. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMeta's vast reach (it's also a beneficiary of the network effect) makes it an essential go-to for advertisers looking to reach consumers of all types. Facebook may be Meta's leading platform, but Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger all contribute to the company's nearly 4 billion monthly active users.\n\nA bonus to investing in Meta is the dividend the company declared for the first time in February. At $0.50 per share, with a dividend yield of around 0.40%, it's not one that income-seeking investors will drool over, but it can add to investors' total returns over time, and should continue to grow annually.\n\n3. DraftKings\n\nDraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG) is another stock in Wood's ARK Innovation ETF. The sports betting giant is one of the biggest platforms in the industry, and should continue its momentum as the sports betting craze spreads.\n\nThe U.S. sports betting market has entered the mainstream, as 38 states and Washington, D.C. currently allow it in some form. This is a dramatic turnaround from just six years ago, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided to overturn its federal ban on commercial sports betting (with a few exceptions like Las Vegas).\n\nDraftKings has taken full advantage of the relatively recent developments, too. Five years ago, at the end of the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018, DraftKings had 1.7 million unique customers on its platform. Fast-forward to Q4 of 2023 and that number has skyrocketed to 7.1 million.\n\nDraftKings is the No. 1 player in the online U.S. sports betting and iGaming industry, so it's in a good position to grow rapidly alongside the overall industry. Globally, online sports betting brought in about $43 billion in revenue in 2023. By 2029, it's forecast to generate more than $65.6 billion. There are still plenty of growth opportunities, and DraftKings's focus on capturing market share should give it long-term advantages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Volatility is an unavoidable feature of the stock market, and it's especially pronounced in growth stocks. Investors can count on this market segment being among the first to recover when a broader rally begins. On the flip side, growth stocks tend to fall hard in the early phases of a sell-off.\n\nIf you can, it's helpful to think of these drops as opportunities to pick up quality businesses at reduced valuations rather than something to be feared. A little preparation in the form of a watch list can make all the difference in ensuring you are ready to make moves when the next cyclical downturn begins.\n\nWith that goal in mind, let's look at some excellent growth stocks worth considering in a stock market sell-off.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) stock isn't cheap these days. The rally in the tech world has helped push the software giant's valuation to about 14 times annual sales. That translates into one of the highest premiums you could pay for a profitable tech leader. Apple shares are available at 7 times revenue, for context, and Amazon is even cheaper at just 3 times sales.\n\nMicrosoft's many growth avenues help explain why investors love this stock. It has lots of exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom both through its OpenAI partnership and through the tech's availability across its own software portfolio. You don't have to wait for AI to supercharge sales gains, either, thanks to Microsoft's quickly expanding enterprise services division. Growth here helped the company log a 16% sales spike in the most recent quarter.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) shares never seem like a steal, in contrast with the consumer staples products that the warehouse retailer sells in bulk by the millions. The stock has been a huge winner for shareholders in the past year, jumping over 40% in 12 months while the wider market is up 26%. That rally pushed its valuation above 1.3 times sales, or double the rate you'd pay to own rival Walmart. You might be better off waiting for a stock market drop before diving into Costco stock at that price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, Costco is firing on all cylinders right now. Customer traffic is up, membership renewal rates are at a record high, and shoppers are flocking to its online business thanks to innovative merchandise offerings like the recent gold bar craze. Yet the company could disappoint investors this year given high expectations around a membership fee hike and rising profitability.\n\nI'd look to buy the stock if there's a pullback due to the chain falling a bit short of those lofty Wall Street targets.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is among the biggest winners of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" having gained over 130% in the past full year. The rally makes sense given that the social media giant's business is on an incredible roll. Despite a tough digital advertising market, revenue rose 16% last year and earnings soared 66% to $39 billion. \"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a February press release.\n\nWall Street is salivating at the potential for more earnings growth once the digital advertising market starts recovering. Watch the average price per ad metric for signs of that rebound starting over the next few quarters. In the meantime, keep Meta on your watch list in case a downturn delivers a more compelling valuation. Shares do seem a bit pricey right now at their current premium of 33 times earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Why \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Meta and Amazon Rallied Today, While Tesla Stock Tapped the Brakes",
        "content": "Since the beginning of last year, the group of stocks collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has helped push the market higher. The combination of industry-leading positions and connections to artificial intelligence (AI) has made this group of high-profile stocks a must-have for many investors. However, since the beginning of 2024, there's been a divergence, and while some members continue to pull their weight, others have fallen short.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) climbed 3.1%, e-commerce and cloud pioneer Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) rose 3.1%, and electric vehicle (EV) specialist Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) tumbled 1.9%, as of 1:45 p.m. ET. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBusiness-based drivers\n\nMeta Platforms investors were optimistic today after the social media company responded to allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it violated a 2020 privacy agreement. The settlement banned the company from profiting from data related to minors.\n\nThe FTC sought to amend the accord, but Meta pushed back, saying it \"voluntarily disclosed the technical errors\" detected in its Messenger Kids app. The FTC is looking to impose additional restrictions on Meta, which could ultimately be more costly. Investors welcomed the company's response to regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of things appear to be moving Amazon stock. Reports have emerged that the company is cutting a number of jobs in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment as it seeks to rein in costs. The company is reportedly eliminating hundreds of positions, including those in marketing, sales, and global services.\n\nFurthermore, in an overhaul of its Amazon Fresh stores, the company announced it is eliminating its \"Just Walk Out\" technology from stores in the U.S., replacing the costly systems with smart shopping carts. This move will also likely save Amazon money over the long term, and investors applauded the cost-saving measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are also a couple of reports that are driving Tesla. Unfortunately for investors, the stock is headed in the other direction. In the wake of what some market watchers called a \"nightmare quarter\" for Tesla, there are reports the company is slashing prices on the Model Y -- its most popular vehicle -- by as much as $7,000 in the U.S.\n\nThe move is designed to clear out the company's massive backlog of inventory, as Tesla reported manufacturing 46,000 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter. This will likely have a negative impact on Tesla's bottom line for the current quarter.\n\nAdditionally, according to a report by Reuters, Tesla has decided to scrap plans to build a lower-priced model. The project has been on the drawing board for years, and a less-costly model was seen as a way to appeal to a broader cross-section of the car market. If Tesla were to abandon this long-term goal, this could impact how investors view the company's future prospects.\n\nIt's worth noting that CEO Elon Musk reportedly refuted the claims on social media.\n\nA parting of the ways?\n\nIt seemed the Magnificent Seven could do no wrong last year, with the group often moving higher in unison. Eventually, however, investors will demand performance from even the most viral businesses, and that appears to be happening thus far in 2024. Meta and Amazon, along with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are all outpacing the S&P 500 this year, while Tesla and Apple -- which have both faced headwinds -- are lagging the broader market.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Meta is the cheapest of our trio of stocks, selling for just 26 times forward earnings, compared to multiples of 44 and 59 for Amazon and Tesla, respectively.\n\nTo be clear, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks has the potential to lead the market higher again, but investors will require strong business and financial performance before fueling further gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta announced major changes to its policies on digitally created and altered media on Friday, ahead of U.S. elections poised to test its ability to police deceptive content generated by new artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nThe social media giant will start applying \"Made with AI\" labels in May to AI-generated videos, images and audio posted on its platforms, expanding a policy that previously addressed only a narrow slice of doctored videos, Vice President of Content Policy Monika Bickert said in a blog post.\n\nBickert said Meta would also apply separate and more prominent labels to digitally altered media that poses a \"particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance,\" regardless of whether the content was created using AI or other tools.\n\nThe new approach will shift the company's treatment of manipulated content. It will move from one focused on removing a limited set of posts toward one that keeps the content up while providing viewers with information about how it was made.\n\nMeta previously announced a scheme to detect images made using other companies' generative AI tools using invisible markers built into the files, but did not give a start date at the time.\n\nA company spokesperson told Reuters the new labeling approach would apply to content posted on Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Threads services. Its other services, including WhatsApp and Quest virtual reality headsets, are covered by different rules.\n\nMeta will begin applying the more prominent \"high-risk\" labels immediately, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe changes come months before a U.S. presidential election in November that tech researchers warn may be transformed by new generative AI technologies. Political campaigns have already begun deploying AI tools in places like Indonesia, pushing the boundaries of guidelines issued by providers like Meta and generative AI market leader OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, Meta's oversight board called the company's existing rules on manipulated media \"incoherent\" after reviewing a video of U.S. President Joe Biden posted on Facebook last year that altered real footage to wrongfully suggest he had behaved inappropriately.\n\nThe footage was permitted to stay up, as Meta's existing \"manipulated media\" policy bars misleadingly altered videos only if they were produced by artificial intelligence or if they make people appear to say words they never actually said.\n\nThe board said the policy should also apply to non-AI content, which is \"not necessarily any less misleading\" than content generated by AI, as well as to audio-only content and videos depicting people doing things they never actually did.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

Previously, Meta’s “manipulated media” policy stated that the company would remove videos that had “been edited or synthesized,” in ways “that are not apparent to an average person, and would likely mislead an average person” into thinking someone in the video had said something they did not.\n\nThe new policy extends to “digitally created or altered images, video or audio,” the company wrote Friday in a blog post. Misleading posts can still be fact-checked as well and labeled as such, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nMeta announced the change after its Oversight Board, an independent group of academics and researchers that review the company’s content moderation decisions, criticized the “manipulated media” policy in February, calling it “incoherent.” The board also recommended using more labels on AI-generated content instead of removing the videos or posts.\n\n“We agree that providing transparency and additional context is now the better way to address this content,” Meta wrote in the blog post. The company will label AI-generated video, audio and images as “Made with AI” under the new policy, which will begin in May.\n\nHow Meta deals with AI-generated content has been an important policy topic this year given the looming US elections in November. Meta has previously talked about the need to automatically label AI-generated posts, including those posts created using competitors’ technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future China’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Meta Platforms Insiders Sold US$15m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$511. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\n\nInsiders in Meta Platforms didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nMeta Platforms Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Meta Platforms\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$176b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Meta Platforms Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Meta Platforms stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\n\nBut note: Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Strong Buy AR Stocks to Add to Your Q2 Must-Watch List",
        "content": "Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy.\n\nWith the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines.\n\nA potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.\n\nMatching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Walmart: These 2 Potential Stock-Split Stocks Are Cheaper and Smarter Buys",
        "content": "Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all reached record highs in 2024, getting to this point has been an adventure. Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes traded off bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nWhen uncertainty picks up on Wall Street, both professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out the safety and historic outperformance of industry-leading businesses. It's why the \"FAANG stocks\" have been so popular over the last decade. But for the past three years, investors have really gravitated to stocks enacting splits. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors of all walks have piled into stock-split stocks\n\nA stock split is a purely cosmetic event that allows publicly traded companies to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. The key with stock splits is they have no impact on market cap or operating performance. Their purpose is to make shares more nominally affordable for investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their online broker (a forward stock split), or to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse stock split).\n\nThough there are a few examples of successful reverse stock splits, such as online travel company Booking Holdings, most investors tend to focus on companies enacting forward stock splits. That's because companies enacting forward splits are usually highfliers with well-defined competitive advantages.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, close to a dozen top-notch businesses have conducted forward splits, including the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia; leading global internet search engine parent Alphabet; and North America's top electric vehicle manufacturer, Tesla.\n\nThus far in 2024, two exceptionally successful businesses with well-defined competitive advantages have joined the club:\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) completed a 3-for-1 stock split in late February; and Chipotle Mexican Grill is on track to enact a 50-for-1 forward split by late June, assuming its shareholders approve the move when the company holds its annual meeting.\n\nDespite its competitive advantages, investors can leave Walmart on the shelf\n\nWalmart kicked things off in late January when it announced plans to conduct its first split since March 1999.\n\nWalmart President and CEO Doug McMillon noted in a company press release that, \"Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.\" Specifically, this move should help over 400,000 associates purchase whole shares of Walmart stock, rather than fractional shares.\n\nIf there's one factor that exemplifies why Walmart has been such a phenomenal investment for decades, look no further than its size. Walmart's deep pockets allow it to buy products in bulk, which in turn lowers its per-unit costs. The company has consistently been able to undercut grocery chains and local retailers on price.\n\nTo add, Walmart almost always carries a broader assortment of goods, including groceries, than traditional grocers and retailers. A generally cheaper and broader selection has been a winning formula.\n\nBut even winners have their limits.\n\nFollowing its post-split run-up, Walmart stock is now valued at 23 times forward-year earnings. Though this is more or less right in line with its forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years, it's a reach for a company whose growth rate is slowing and struggling to outpace the prevailing rate of inflation.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (Walmart's fiscal year ended on Jan. 26, 2024), consolidated sales rose by just 4.9% on a constant-currency basis, which excludes any gains or losses from foreign currency conversion. In the current fiscal year, Walmart's constant-currency sales growth is expected to slow to just 3% to 4%. Mind you, the trailing-12-month inflation rate in the U.S. is 3.2%. Walmart is simply treading water in the current climate.\n\nWhile long-term investors in Walmart should be just fine, there are other potential stock-split stocks that are considerably cheaper and smarter buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe first company primed for a stock split that's markedly cheaper than Walmart is semiconductor stock Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Though Broadcom enacted three splits prior to being acquired by Avago Technologies (which kept the Broadcom name) in 2016, Avago itself has never undertaken any stock splits. Broadcom ended the trading session on April 2 at nearly $1,339 per share.\n\nAt the moment, Broadcom is being fueled by the AI revolution. The company's Jericho3-AI chip, which was unveiled last April, is designed to scale connectivity in high-compute enterprise data centers and can connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units. This is just the type of innovation needed to train large language models and power generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has fallbacks that extend well beyond AI. For example, it's a leading provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Carriers upgrading their networks to support 5G download speeds have provided Broadcom with steady demand as businesses and consumers replace their older wireless devices.\n\nTo add to the above, Broadcom has other operating segments that benefit from increased digitization. For instance, the company's automotive solutions address everything from advanced driver assistance systems to battery management in next-generation vehicles. Meanwhile, it offers financial services software and infrastructure designed to improve the digital banking experience for consumers and employees.\n\nWhile Broadcom's forward-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5 is effectively in line with Walmart's, its estimated annualized earnings growth rate over the next five years of 14.4% is considerably higher. Thus, Broadcom's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) is far more attractive than Walmart's.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe second potential stock-split stock that makes for a considerably cheaper and smarter buy than Walmart is none other than social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta hasn't split since becoming a public company in 2012 and recently hit an all-time high of a little north of $520 per share.\n\nIf you're wondering what makes Meta \"tick,\" take a closer look at its social media assets. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, with 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter. Adding in Meta's other exceptionally popular platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger, brings the company's unique MAU count to 3.98 billion for the fourth quarter. It's not difficult to attract advertisers and command strong ad-pricing power when more than half of the world's adult population is visiting at least one of your owned assets each month.\n\nAnother reason Meta is such an amazing company is its cash generation. Last year, it generated $71.1 billion in net cash from its operations and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This war chest gives it plenty of financial flexibility with regard to acquisitions and innovations.\n\nMeta Platforms is also attempting to become a leader in augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), with a longer-term goal by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be a key on-ramp to the metaverse. Though the company's investments in its Reality Labs segment are probably years away from being a meaningful percentage of total sales, Meta looks well positioned to be a leader in AR and VR.\n\nLastly, the valuation is extremely compelling when placed side-by-side with Walmart. While Meta's forward P/E of 21 might not sound like that much of a discount, its annualized earnings growth rate over the coming five years is expected to be 26%! This works out to a PEG ratio of less than 1, which signals a potentially undervalued stock-split candidate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 3, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Meta Platforms META, Veeva Systems VEEV and BILL Holdings BILL.\n\nIndustry: Internet Software\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2249005/3-internet-software-stocks-to-buy-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Internet Software industry is benefiting from accelerated demand for digital transformation and the ongoing shift to the cloud. The high demand for Software as a Service or SaaS-based solutions due to the increasing need for remote working, learning and diagnosis software has been a major driver for the industry players.\n\nThe growing demand for solutions that support hybrid operating environments is noteworthy. The increasing deployment of AI and generative AI is driving prospects. The growing proliferation of Augmented and Virtual Reality devices is noteworthy.\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks are driving cybersecurity application demand. Meta Platforms, Veeva Systems and BILL Holdings are benefiting from these trends. However, heightened geopolitical risks, raging inflation and high interest rates are major headwinds.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Internet Software industry comprises companies offering application performance monitoring, as well as infrastructure and application software, DevOps deployment and Security software. Industry participants offer multi-cloud application security and delivery, social networking, online payment and 3D printing applications and solutions. They use the SaaS-based cloud computing model to deliver solutions to end-users, as well as enterprises.\n\nHence, subscription is the primary revenue source. Advertising is also a major revenue source. Industry participants target a variety of end markets, including banking and financial services, service providers, federal governments, and animal health technology and services.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Internet Software Industry\n\nAdoption of SaaS Growing: The industry is benefiting from the continued demand for digital transformation. Growth prospects are alluring primarily due to the rapid adoption of SaaS, which offers a flexible and cost-effective delivery method of applications. It also cuts down on deployment time compared to legacy systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nSaaS attempts to deliver applications to any user, anywhere, anytime and on any device. It has been effective in addressing customer expectations of seamless communications across multiple channels, including voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile. This increases customer satisfaction and raises the retention rate, driving the top lines of the industry participants. Moreover, the SaaS delivery model has supported the industry players to deliver software applications amid the coronavirus-led lockdowns and shelter-in-place guidance. Remote working, learning and diagnosis have also boosted the demand for SaaS-based software applications.\n\nPay-As-You-Go Model Gaining Traction: The increasing customer-centric approach is allowing end-users to perform all required actions with minimal intervention from software providers. The pay-as-you-go model helps Internet Software providers scale their offerings per the needs of different users. The subscription-based business model ensures recurring revenues for the industry participants. The affordability of the SaaS delivery model, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, is another major driver. The cloud-based applications are easy to use. Hence, the need for specialized training is reduced significantly, which lowers expenses, thereby driving profits.\n\nOngoing Transition to Cloud Creating Opportunities: The growing need to secure cloud platforms amid the increasing incidences of cyber-attacks and hacking drives the demand for web-based cyber security software. As enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments, application and infrastructure monitoring is gaining importance. This is increasing the demand for web-based performance management monitoring tools.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Internet Software industry, placed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector, carries a Zacks Industry Rank #30, which places it in the top 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2024 have moved up 31.5% since Apr 30, 2023.\n\nGiven the positive outlook of the industry, there are a number of stocks worth picking for healthy portfolio returns. However, before we present the top industry picks, it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Beats Sector, S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Internet Software industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 57.1% over this period compared with the S&P 500 Index’s jump of 27.7% and the broader sector’s growth of 41.5%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Internet Software stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 3.48X compared with the S&P 500’s 4.09X and the sector’s trailing 12-month P/S of 5.18X.\n\nOver the last three years, the industry traded as high as 7.43X and as low as 1.67X, with a median of 4.34X.\n\n3 Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nMeta Platforms- This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been unchanged at $19.94 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nVeeva Systems- This company is benefiting from the robust customer adoption of its products.\n\nVEEV has inked a few strategic alliances over the past few months, which are expected to drive its prospects. Its latest additions include Recipharm, which is using Veeva Vault QMS, Veeva Vault QualityDocs and Veeva Vault Training to streamline its quality operations. Biopharma giants like GSK and Bayer are using the company’s solutions.\n\nA strong liquidity position makes the stock attractive to investors.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #1 company have gained 19.8% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VEEV’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.14 per share, up 11% over the past 30 days.\n\nBILL Holdings- This Zacks Rank #1 company is benefiting from an expanding small and medium business clientele, as well as a diversified business model.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion's share of the heavy lifting has been done by the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have taken Wall Street to new heights\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%. MSFT Chart\n\nThe second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter. Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in April: Meta Platforms\n\nAmong the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.\n\nBut there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta.\n\nAs noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta.\n\nSomething that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028.

The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nSomething else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace.\n\nAs I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers.\n\nRegulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nLast but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend. This makes Nvidia a stock worth avoiding in April.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The ‘Meta AI mafia’ brain drain continues with at least 3 more high-level departures",
        "content": "AI talent is in such high demand that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly taken to wooing top AI engineers and researchers with personal appeals. But Meta is also losing experienced AI talent who are jumping ship to work at AI startups.\n\nAt least three high-level Meta AI employees have departed the company in the past few weeks to strike out on their own. These include computer scientist and senior director of engineering Erik Meijer, who in an exclusive interview with Fortune said he had declined “stellar offers” from several of the “most sought-out” AI companies.\n\nMeijer, who announced his departure from Meta on X last week, said he is not looking for a new role, but has a startup in the works: He is building an AI assistant platform for enterprises called Automind, and an end-user scripting language called Universalis.\n\nIn addition, Devi Parikh, Meta’s senior director of generative AI, also left last week, saying on X she was “nervous, because who in their right mind walks away from the job I had in times like these (leading research efforts in generative media and multimodal LLMs)?!” And research scientist Abhishek Das said working at Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) had been “one of my most cherished career journeys,” but that he is “excited to build something new.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg is wooing top AI talent\n\nThe race is on in Big Tech to court top AI talent, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has taken to penning personal emails to GoogleDeepMind researchers, as well as offering sky-high pay packages, to try to persuade them to come to Meta, according to a recent report from The Information.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Meijer and the others from jumping ship: He had previously led Meta’s Probability team, a 50-person research group focused on machine learning infrastructure. The entire team was laid off in November 2022, but Meijer stayed on at Meta working in the organization running PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework that helps speed research prototyping to production deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn explaining his new, as-yet-unnamed startup, he said that knowledge workers have to interact with so many applications specialized for specific problems, which requires mastering different systems and constantly switching between apps.\n\n“What you want is a single, fully personalized application that can help you solve any problem,” he said. “People have been thinking about this for decades or even centuries. With generative AI, this finally becomes possible.”\n\nWhile many startups are looking to build this kind of “intelligent agent,” he said few have the kind of enterprise focus that tackles security and privacy and is reliable and scalable.\n\n“I often joke that the ‘chat with your PDF in five-minute’ solutions are like the old ‘get fit quick’ ads on the back of comic books,” he said. “There are no shortcuts.”\n\nBetter to build on LLMs outside Big Tech\n\nMeijer said he believes that if you want to build things on top of LLMs, it’s better to do so outside the big companies. Competitive pressure is leading to ever-more-powerful models, longer context windows (which determine how much data you can feed an AI model at one time), and lower prices, he explained. Thousands of developers are now fine-tuning, optimizing, and shrinking models like Meta’s Llama (which he called a “brilliant move” by the company). It all makes for what Meijer called a unique era in the tech industry “where the pace of research and innovation is absolutely breathtaking. His aim, he added, is “to surf that wave as far and hard as I can.”\n\nThat said, Meijer emphasized that if one is interested in creating and training new general-purpose models, there is no choice but to join Big Tech, because it costs billions to train LLMs. But “for what I want to do I do not need access to compute,” he explained, since he will simply be using an API. As for doubts about the success of LLM “wrapper” startups, he pointed out that for complex wrappers like what he has in mind, companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, or Anthropic are unlikely to tackle them.\n\n“I mean, you can say that Facebook is a wrapper on top of MySQL, but that does not imply that it is easy for Oracle to replicate or replace it,” he said, referring to an open-source database management system that is widely used in the industry and which was originally developed by Oracle.\n\nTiming of recent Meta departures might be cyclical\n\nStill, many have wondered about the timing of the recent Meta departures. But Meijer posited it might be a result of the yearly performance review rhythm. “Early in the current AI wave people left Google to found OpenAI, Cohere, and then Anthropic,” he said. “Even in 2022 people were talking about the ‘Meta AI mafia,’ and conversely, lots of people that try startups and fail boomerang back to the Big Tech companies.”\n\nThe ebb and flow of leaving established companies to venture out on your own and returning is “the essence of Silicon Valley,” he noted. “That said, this is probably the best time in tech history to strike out on your own.”\n\nAnshumali Shrivastava, an associate professor in the department of computer science at Rice University, agreed, telling Fortune: “This is arguably the inflection point in technology with AI,” and that it is hard for established companies to move at a pace innovators want. “The upper management at large companies simply cannot move at a disruptive pace to risk their existing customer base and market,” he explained.\n\nStill, he said, there is a limited window of opportunity for those willing to jump ship. “For all the great talent in AI, if … they had a dream of being the driving force into the future, this seems like the optimal time,” he said. “Technology is there, the market is bubbling, and VCs have opened the banks for risk takers. Who will not do it?”\n\nBut Shrivastava also pointed out that in Silicon Valley, those leaving Big Tech to start companies building solutions to targeted problems may one day end up having their companies acquired by their previous employer—or a close competitor with the same problem. \"Note that the Silicon Valley VC ecosystem is run by past executives of successful Big Tech companies, most of whom have seen all this first hand and they have a niche in identifying and supporting such opportunities,\" he explained.\n\nArvind Narayanan, professor of computer science at Princeton University, agreed that once the fog settles and it becomes clear which apps are most useful, incumbents often start to dominate again through a combination of building and acquiring. \"Every time there's a new platform or layer of the technology stack, there is an opportunity for startups to build apps on top of it,\" he said. \"We saw this with the PC, the web, mobile app stores, and now we're seeing it with generative AI.\" With departures from Meta and other Big Tech companies, the action is shifting to a new layer, he explained, \"and the cycle repeats.\"\n\nStill 'bullish' on Meta's AI efforts\n\nMeijer, however, says he continues to be “bullish” on Meta “as long as Mark is in charge and keeps investing in AI.”\n\nAnd even though he and his team were laid off from Meta’s Probability team in 2022, that pivot turned into an AI advantage.\n\n“Right around the time of the layoffs, ChatGPT came out and I immediately realized that much of what we aimed for in Probability that was hard or impossible was now within reach,” he explained. “Having no team to support anymore allowed me to jump head first into the new world of generative AI.” Much of Probability’s attention was aimed at developer productivity, but after playing with ChatGPT it was  obvious that the problem of developer productivity was essentially solved.\n\n“So I changed my attention to AI-based productivity for general knowledge workers, which is a much larger segment than developers,” he said. “As weird as it sounds, I am actually rather grateful that I was more or less forced to pivot from developing custom models to working on top of foundation models due to the layoffs. And during my tenure at the company I got to support some amazing teams and pioneer the field of AI for productivity when everyone thought that was a bat-crazy idea. So I only look back with fond memories and a sense of pride for what my people accomplished.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "The social media giant Meta allegedly allowed Netflix to access Facebook users' direct messages for nearly a decade, breaking anti-competitive activities and privacy rules, explosive court documents claim.\n\nThe court documents, which were unsealed last week, are part of a major anti-trust lawsuit filed by U.S. citizens Maximilian Klein and Sarah Grabert, who claim Netflix and Facebook \"enjoyed a special relationship\" so that Netflix could better tailor its ads with Facebook.\n\nFacebook received millions of dollars in ad revenue from Netflix as part of these close ties, guaranteeing ad spending of $150 million in 2017, the lawsuit claims. Social media giant Meta allegedly allowed Netflix to peek into Facebook users' direct messages, court documents claim.\n\nAPPLE, GOOGLE, META TARGETED IN EU'S FIRST DIGITAL MARKETS ACT INVESTIGATIONS\n\nThe lawsuit also claims Netflix's co-founder, Reed Hastings, joined Facebook’s board of directors and then was instrumental in the closure of Facebook Watch – a streaming service competitor to Netflix.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in April 2023 and demands the court have Hastings respond to the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"For nearly a decade, Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship. Netflix bought hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook ads; entered into a series of agreements sharing data with Facebook; received bespoke access to private Facebook APIs; and agreed to custom partnerships and integrations that helped supercharge Facebook’s ad targeting and ranking models,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAPIs (application programming interface) are pieces of software that allow two or more computer programs or components to communicate and share information with each other.\n\nThe API agreement allowed \"Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s private messages inboxes, in exchange Netflix would ‘provide to FB a written report every two weeks that shows daily counts of recommendations sends and recipient clicks by interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variation (e.g. Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation receipts).’\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"In August 2013, Facebook provided Netflix with access to its so-called ‘Titan API,’ a private API that allowed a whitelisted partner to access, among other things, Facebook users’ ‘messaging app and non-app friends,’\" the documents claim. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg established Meta in 2021.\n\nINSTAGRAM USERS FUME AS APP BEGINS LIMITING POLITICAL CONTENT\n\nMeta has said in the past that it does not disclose people’s private messages to partners without their knowledge and that the API access only gave partners an ability to reach inboxes, i.e. to send messages to users via API.\n\n\"Meta didn’t share people’s private messages with Netflix,\" a Meta spokesperson told Fox Business on Tuesday. \"As the document says, the agreement allowed people to message their friends on Facebook about what they were watching on Netflix, directly from the Netflix app. Such agreements are commonplace in the industry. We are confident the facts will show this complaint is meritless.\"\n\nFOX Business also reached out to Netflix for further comment but did not immediately receive a response. Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021 as its CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled metaverse, a virtual reality space.\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times published a report citing hundreds of pages of Facebook documents, alleging Facebook had authorized Spotify and Netflix to access users' DMs.\n\nThe publication reported that the connections helped Facebook gain explosive growth and bolstered its ad revenue streams.\n\nMeta has already been fined for sharing users' information without permission.\n\nIn 2022, Ireland fined Meta $284 million after data about more than half a billion users was leaked online. Netflix logo is displayed in a photo illustration, Jan. 23, 2023.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFull names, phone numbers, locations and birthdays of users who used the platform between 2018 and 2019 were leaked online by a \"bad actor\" who Meta said exploited a security vulnerability, reports the Daily Mail.\n\nThat same year, Meta agreed to pay $725 million to settle a security breach case related to Cambridge Analytica, a British social media engineering company.\n\nThe firm had paid Facebook for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users, which was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Donald Trump's election win.\n\nOriginal article source:Facebook let Netflix peek into user DMs, explosive court docs claim",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy This Month: April 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks are a hot topic on Wall Street. Just remember that a stock's valuation always matters. You can't unquestioningly pay any price for even the best companies and expect the returns you want.\n\nWith that in mind, some quality stocks are trading at attractive prices today. Among them are Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Salesforce(NYSE: CRM), and SentinelOne (NYSE: S).\n\nHere is the pitch for each stock and why investors can confidently buy them today.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make more money from the nearly 4 billion people using its apps each month. Brands can now leverage AI tools to increase the efficiency of ads reaching their target audience. Meta has grown to over a trillion-dollar valuation on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, but Threads is steadily emerging as the next potential social media winner.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that Threads, which competes with Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter), has grown to over 130 million monthly active users. There is still virtually no monetization occurring on Threads because Meta is focusing on increasing its user base. Still, this momentum is promising for a company that has proven it can turn social networks into cash cows.\n\nDon't get me wrong; Meta is a table-pounding buy, even without knowing how Threads will eventually impact the business. Shares have surged over the past 18 months but still trade at a forward P/E ratio of 24. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by an average of 19% to 20% annually over the next three to five years, making the stock a potential bargain for its expected growth. No company does social media like Meta Platforms.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nEnterprise software has become a vast industry that Salesforce sits squarely in the middle of. The company was built on its customer relationship management software but has expanded to virtually every aspect of what you need to run a company. After some bolt-on acquisitions, Salesforce also offers collaboration tools via Slack and data tools on Tableau.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce is using AI to enhance its existing business. This generative AI, which Salesforce calls Einstein, is implemented throughout Salesforce to make its various products more useful. It's like having a digital assistant at your side. It's an internal AI that helps users answer questions, understand and predict customer behaviors, and create content across all parts of Salesforce's software suite.\n\nFinancially, Salesforce is trading at attractive levels today. The stock trades at 31 times 2024 earnings, but that's supported by solid earnings growth that analysts see averaging nearly 18% over the coming years. That's a fair PEG ratio of 1.8. Investors can nibble on this blue chip technology stock and get more aggressive if shares slip to a more attractive price.\n\n3. SentinelOne\n\nOther companies, such as SentinelOne, built their products on AI. SentinelOne is a cybersecurity company that uses AI to proactively hunt for viruses and other threats on devices and their networks. Cybersecurity is very competitive, so SentinelOne must stay on the cutting edge of technology. The company has received accolades from third parties like Gartner for its excellence in protection.\n\nSentinelOne gets knocked for not being a profitable business. However, its quarterly cash burn has improved from $32 million to just $10 million over the past year, so free-cash-flow generation appears imminent. Additionally, SentinelOne has a sparkling balance sheet with zero debt and $925 million in cash. The company should be well into profitability by the time cash runs low.\n\nThat lack of profitability has put shares at a discount. Its most direct competitor, CrowdStrikeHoldings, trades at over twice the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) SentinelOne does. That's fair today, but long-term investors who believe SentinelOne can balance growth and turn a profit could enjoy scooping up shares on the cheap. The stock's P/S ratio today is just 9, which was once over 100 when shares first went public.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Thinking Small, Winning Big: 7 Small-Cap Stocks to Supercharge Your Portfolio",
        "content": "If you’re searching for the best small-cap stocks to buy right now, look no further. Small-cap stocks are set to continue their record run as indices like the S&P 600 begin building momentum in light of rate cutting expectations and an improved economic outlook. Since nearly all companies, even the largest, started as small-caps, the sector tends to outperform larger indices in the long term.\n\nWe’re in a particularly unique position, as a year’s worth of higher rates means the worst or least viable companies are on their way out or didn’t survive the financial realignment. Today’s small-cap stocks, therefore, tend to be the strongest of the bunch, with management adept at navigating monetary policy changes and rapidly shifting economic conditions. These seven small-cap stocks stand out as some of the best of the bunch and could prove a solid foundation for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: PubMatic Inc (PUBM) The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital advertising is quickly becoming a perennial sector that tends to retain strength even amid poor economic conditions. While consumer spending may dip and eat into sales growth, the best digital advertising companies successfully navigate shifting conditions to stay afloat, if not thrive. PubMatic Inc (NASDAQ:PUBM) is among just a handful of small-cap digital advertising and media stocks that are successfully adapting to changing preferences – and thriving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year, record revenue figures for the small-cap advertising company hit $267 million in sales. Staying true to its small-cap growth stock designation, the company is plunging excess earnings into a comprehensive growth strategy to build on that momentum. Plans include improved customer acquisition strategies, revenue stream expansion, and increased machine learning emphasis to “[build and scale] ROI and outcomes-based advertising solutions that rival the walled gardens,” with walled gardens being a term describing the largest and impenetrable advertising heavyweights with closed ecosystems like Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAligned much more closely with the “value” side of the value/growth continuum than PubMatic, Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is nevertheless a standout small-cap stock offering investors long-term upside potential alongside short-term stability. To the latter point, the company’s gained nearly 50% over the past year and currently offers a 3.06% forward dividend yield – not bad for a company with less than $1.5 billion in market capitalization!\n\nBut investors looking for small-cap value stocks to buy shouldn’t focus on dividends alone. Instead, look to Steelcase’s steady revenue and rapidly increasing net income, which hit $777 million and $30.8 million in the most recent quarterly report. To that end, the company’s fiscal year 2025 outlook is especially enticing as it capitalizes on a steadier economy and continued remote work trends. Management reported 10% higher sales in the first three weeks of the fiscal year alone and is targeting 1% – 5% revenue growth and EPS between 85 cents and $1.00. Steelcase reported a year’s end EPS of 68 cents, so the rosy executive outlook should be enough to spark interest in small-cap value investors.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor stocks surged over the past year, but mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). As semiconductor demand remains high, but the biggest names tilt toward massive overvaluation, investors will increasingly turn to small-cap semiconductor stocks to find the “next big thing.” Few small-cap semiconductor stocks are as robust as indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI). The company’s offerings focus primarily on automotive and self-driving car semiconductor applications, which are increasingly in demand as new car sales climb and drivers demand state-of-the-art luxuries like driver assistance and enjoyable infotainment displays.\n\nThe company’s 2023 revenue was record-setting, climbing more than 100% to hit $223.2 million. Likewise, the company’s profit margins are beyond reproach at 52.5% in 2023, more than 2.5% higher than the prior year. This margin expansion indicates that the company is not only navigating shifting economic conditions but also thriving as it finds ways to improve efficiencies and cut costs without sacrificing quality.\n\nChegg Inc (CHGG) a child takes notes while attending an online class. represents education stocks. edtech stocks\n\nSource: Travelerpix / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) is a small-cap tech stock capturing one of the AI-adjacent sectors I’m particularly bullish on: education and EdTech. This year saw increased scrutiny and even dismissal of legacy learning institutions, even the most elite, and I think artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging remote work and learning tech will be among the next massive social revolutions. Chegg is adapting AI to a range of learning applications, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant. The tool is built on the back of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and represents one of the few, if not only, broadly successful adaptations or applications of the tools within the EdTech sector.\n\nOf course, new and next-gen tools tend to be costly and unpredictable early in their lifecycle. To that end, Chegg shares dropped more than 30% since 2024 began, primarily on the heels of a less-than-desirable earnings report that included a more modest forecast than analysts expected. Still, Chegg’s management acknowledged the rough patch as part of its R&D into AI EdTech applications, telling investors that its development is “ongoing and iterative” but that R&D costs mean it’s also “too early to predict when we will return to revenue and margin growth.” Still, at its current price point and relatively low valuation, Chegg is a top small-cap stock to capitalize on EdTech’s AI-enabled future.\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks to Buy: H&R Block (HRB) a man in a suit pulling a large bag of money with a rope. hot small-cap stocks for January 2024\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHave you filed your taxes yet? If not, you may be one of many Americans scrambling over the next two weeks, setting H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) for another solid earnings season. One of the primary concerns about companies like H&R Block is the inherent cyclical nature of their business – tax time comes every April, so customers tend to flock to the platform in January but fall off by mid-spring. However, H&R Block’s recent initiatives to smooth its sales cycle are bearing fruit, as spin-off initiatives like its Spruce mobile banking platform set increasingly higher client acquisition and retention rates.\n\nH&R Block’s last financial filing attributed more than $26 million in quarterly revenue to the banking platform. At roughly one-fourth of tax prep sales, that’s still a solid stat – especially when considering $26 million represents customer deposits quadrupling. As rates stay steady or fall, H&R Block will be able to capitalize on increasing deposit rates more and ultimately see income from peripheral financial services surge.\n\nValley National Bancorp An image of a cellphone with a bank on top, surrounded by people and piles of money, a credit card and calculator. fintech stocks\n\nSource: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock\n\nI wrote about Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) last week, focusing on the company’s potential strength as a cannabis stock. However, there’s far more to this small-cap regional bank than its cannabis-centric initiatives. Trading at just 0.6x book value and 7.5x earnings, the small-cap financial stock is undervalued and, in many cases, under-appreciated. Valley’s strong balance sheet and relatively low debt load (a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56, compared to the industry’s 1.2 average) means that management is positioned to adapt to whatever economic conditions may come, as evidenced by its newest stock buyback plan and 5.71% trailing dividend yield.\n\nAnalysts broadly see Valley National as undervalued, with an average $9.50 price target that sits about 20% above today’s per-share pricing. Likewise, they’re increasingly bullish about the small-cap bank stock as 56% call the stock a “hold”, compared to 50% calling for investors to sell during the previous polling period.\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (GCT) a photo of someone typing on a laptop on a wooden table with computer-related images\n\nSource: My Life Graphic/Shutterstock.com\n\nGigaCloud Technology Inc (NASDAQ:GCT) has been on a wild ride thus far in 2024, surging to nearly $45 per share after a solid earnings report before falling back down to pre-earnings levels where it sits today (slightly above $25 per share). But much of that decline seems to be investors merely taking profit rather than a substantial statement about GigaCloud’s long-term potential. The company, whose closest analog is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) trades at just 11x earnings. Those looking at the stock with skepticism considering Alibaba’s fall from grace should consider one major differentiator: GigaCloud services B2B markets and, more than just offering product sourcing, is an all-in-one vendor management platform to navigate cross-border payments and other tricky facets of global eCommerce that small businesses tend to struggle with.\n\nThe small-and-medium-sized business (SMB) market is largely unaddressed, and GigaCloud’s solutions include payment processing, shipment and freight management, AI-enabled fulfillment, and even warehouse storage. This all-in-one package is a boon to SMBs struggling to compete with or work through larger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As time goes on and companies like Amazon increasingly squeeze SMBs through fee and fulfillment rate hikes, those going it alone will increasingly turn to self-sourced/self-managed platforms like GigaCloud.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Inflation, Buy These 5 Stocks on the Ongoing Tech Rally",
        "content": "Wall Street ended the first quarter on an impressive note after a solid 2023. All the major indexes hit fresh record highs, and the rally is expected to continue as the Federal Reserve has indicated at least three rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nThe Dow and the S&P 500 were the first to hit a record high. The Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up in the race but did so in February end. In the first quarter, the Nasdaq gained 9.1%.\n\nTech stocks were responsible for the broader market rally in 2023 and the momentum has continued into this year.\n\nThe tech rally is being fueled by the ongoing optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, spearheaded by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nAI holds immense potential and the world is yet to witness it, several experts believe. NVIDIA’s success over the past year has inspired several other tech companies, big and small, to shift focus to AI to ensure more business opportunities in the coming days.\n\nThe advancement of smart devices is greatly influencing this domain, as they necessitate computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nSuch operations demand high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and enhanced graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are fostering favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry to thrive.\n\nInterestingly, the Nasdaq rally comes despite inflation coming in hotter than expected in the first two months of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 0.4% sequentially in February, higher than a rise of 0.3% in the prior month and the biggest increase since September 2023. Core PPI also rose 0.4% month over month in February.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve said last month that it still plans three rate cuts of 25 basis points each by the end of this year. Although the Fed didn’t give a timeline, market participants believe the first rate cut is likely to happen in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Logitech International LOGI and Microsoft Corporation MSFT, whichhave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCould Goldilocks Run in Q2 Be Even More Thrilling?\n\nU.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\n\nSolid Fundamentals of the U.S. Economy\n\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\n\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.\n\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Saga to Continue in the Long Term\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\n\nStrong Expectations for Q1 2024 Earnings\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\n\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nFed’s Rate Cut Indications\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AMZN has surged 18.8% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.\n\nBy the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock may be in a bubble\n\nOver the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nNvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.\n\nNvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.\n\nThe chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.\n\nHere are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.\n\n1. Alphabet: $1.88 trillion current market cap (Class A shares, GOOGL)\n\nThe first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nThe reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.\n\n2. Amazon: $1.87 trillion current market cap\n\nLike Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nHowever, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: $1.24 trillion current market cap\n\nEven though social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.\n\nMeta's \"secret sauce\" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.\n\nThe other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match. BRK.A Chart\n\n4. Berkshire Hathaway: $908 billion current market cap (Class A shares, BRK.A)\n\nA fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!\n\nOne of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the \"Oracle of Omaha's\" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.\n\nWarren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.\n\n5. Visa: $573 billion current market cap\n\nThe fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa(NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.\n\nWhat makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nVisa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Meta Platforms (META) closed at $491.35, marking a +1.19% move from the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.6%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.11%.\n\nShares of the social media company witnessed a loss of 3.33% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 2.99% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Meta Platforms in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $4.27, indicating a 61.74% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $36.07 billion, up 25.94% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $19.94 per share and revenue of $158.75 billion, indicating changes of +34.1% and +17.68%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. At present, Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Meta Platforms's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 24.35. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 30.03.\n\nIt is also worth noting that META currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.92.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, positioning it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

        "content": "When it comes to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta(NASDAQ: META), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.\n\nApple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year. AAPL data by YCharts.\n\nApple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.\n\nWhy is Apple stock down?\n\nApple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.\n\nChina accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.\n\nNow that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.\n\nIs Apple stock a buy now?\n\nHere are three reasons for optimism:\n\nConsumer strength Services Return of capital.\n\nWhile iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below. Source: Statista.\n\nServices include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.\n\nApple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.\n\nApple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.\n\nLastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by \"bridging the physical and digital space.\" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.\n\nApple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "We Think Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Can Manage Its Debt With Ease",
        "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms's Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 Meta Platforms had debt of US$18.4b, up from US$9.92b in one year. But it also has US$65.4b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$47.0b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Meta Platforms' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$32.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$44.5b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$65.4b and US$16.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$5.12b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.24t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Meta Platforms has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to that, we're happy to report that Meta Platforms has boosted its EBIT by 50%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 78% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Meta Platforms has US$47.0b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 50% over the last year. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "title": "Goldilocks' Golden Run to be More Thrilling in Q2: 5 Picks",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets witnessed an impressive first quarter of 2024 after an astonishing 2023. Wall Street’s bull run got an added boost this year, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation. Now, the question is, next what? We believe, that the bulls will continue to roar, supported by a robust U.S. economy.\n\nSolid Fundamentals of the U.S. Economy\n\nU.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with a 1.9% rise in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession. Moreover, the Fed raised the U.S. GDP forecast for 2024 to 2.1% in the March FOMC meeting from 1.4% in December 2023.\n\nThe core PCE inflation rate (excluding volatile food and energy items) — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 0.3% month over month in February compared with 0.5% in the previous month. Year over year, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% in February compared with 2.9% in January. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the data was in line with the central bank’s expectations.\n\nPeak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient. Moreover, personal consumption expenditure — the largest driver of the GDP — increased 0.8% month over month in February, compared with the consensus estimate of 0.5% and a 0.2% increase in January.\n\nAI Saga to Continue in the Long Term\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the AI-powered semiconductor industry.\n\nStrong Expectations for Q1 2024 Earnings\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off within two weeks. Wall Street is set to see a positive earnings season for three quarters in a row. Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 2.5% from the same period last year on 3.5% higher revenues.\n\nThis follows the 6.7% year-over-year earnings growth on 3.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% year-over-year earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nFed’s Rate Cut Indications\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate coming down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. We have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 72.6% and 84%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. The stock price of META has climbed 37.2% year to date.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 55.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. The stock price of MU has jumped 38.2% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. MSFT’s Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, are drivers of top-line growth. MSFT got off to an early lead in the generative AI race, thanks to its work with OpenAI. The general availability of Copilot for Security holds promises. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 14.6% from fiscal 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 60 days. The stock price of MSFT has rallied 11.9% year to date.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has benefited from Prime and AWS’ momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate have contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers have also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business has contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. The stock price of AMZN has surged 18.8% year to date.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Here's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "\"April showers bring May flowers.\" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.\n\nYou might not think the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.\n\nCrossing names off the list\n\nWe can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.\n\nIt's a similar story for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.\n\nWall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.\n\nThe \"A team\"\n\nThat leaves the \"A team\" as the top contenders: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.\n\nApple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Apple?\n\nI'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.\n\nBut Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI because of its \"incredible breakthrough potential.\" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.\n\nIt's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the \"wow\" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

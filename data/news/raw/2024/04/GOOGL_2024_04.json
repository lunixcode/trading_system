Invest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\n\nThe issue extends beyond images. Gemini also struggles with deeming text as controversial or problematic. This has raised questions about the effectiveness of AI in content moderation and the challenges of programming ethical and accurate AI systems.\n\nAmid these concerns, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., shared his thoughts on AI in an interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last week.\n\nPichai emphasized the need for an open mind and acknowledged the weight of technology like AI, which can progress rapidly and potentially cause large-scale societal disruptions. These issues highlight the high-risk, high-reward nature of startups.\n\nTrending: This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time.\n\n\"I think we have to keep an open mind. Having said that, all of us feel the weight of technology like AI, which can progress fast, there could be larger-scale societal disruptions,\" Pichai said. \"This is something every technology humanity has had to work hard to harness it to be beneficial. This will be one of the most challenging we ever deal with.\"\n\nPichai also called Google's \"woke\" AI \"completely unacceptable,\" but so far, no changes have been made to fix the issues despite Google expanding Gemini to Androids this week.\n\n\"No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry’s development, but we know the bar is high for us, and we will keep at it for however long it takes,\" Picai wrote in an internal company memo.\n\nPichai’s sentiments echo those of other tech leaders, including Elon Musk, who has previously expressed concerns about AI being one of the biggest threats to humanity.\n\nAs the debate around AI continues, the focus remains on finding the balance between technological advancement and ethical considerations, ensuring that AI serves as a force for good.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeep Reading About Startups:\n\nHere is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.

        "title": "Big Tech is pouring hundreds of billions into AI. Should it also get to decide if the technology is ‘safe’?",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI!\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Meta’s earnings reports last week put a spotlight on the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech will pour into AI by the end of 2024.\n\nIn this quarter alone, Google said its capital expenditures were $12 billion, nearly double the amount from a year earlier, driven by massive investment in AI infrastructure including servers and data centers. Meanwhile, Microsoft is reportedly increasing its spending faster than its revenue, but it still doesn’t have enough data center infrastructure to deploy and run its AI models. And Meta’s investors did not react well to the news that the company would spend billions more than investors had expected on AI investments—which CEO Mark Zuckerberg insisted would yield rewards further down the line.\n\nOh, and let’s not forget Amazon, which just invested billions in AI startup Anthropic and plans to spend $150 billion on AI data centers. And many deep-pocketed startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and all of Elon Musk’s companies are also pouring money into the race (Musk recently posted on X that any company that isn't spending $10 billion on AI this year won't be able to compete).\n\nBut Big Tech’s outsized AI spending habits put an interesting spin on another piece of AI news from last week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board, which will advise it on protecting critical infrastructure—from power grids and internet service to airports—from potential AI threats. The 22-member board, required by President Joe Biden’s AI Executive Order announced in November 2023, is heavy with CEOs from the same deep-pocketed companies and startups powering today’s AI boom: Google’s Sundar Pichai; Microsoft’s Satya Nadella; Nvidia’s Jensen Huang; OpenAI’s Sam Altman; Dario Amodei from Anthropic; and the CEOs of Amazon Web Services, AMD, IBM, and Adobe.\n\nThere were immediate criticisms of the board’s makeup, which notably does not include any significant open-source AI representation—that is, companies whose AI models are freely available (either fully or partly, depending on the license) so anyone can modify, personalize, and distribute them without restrictions. Interestingly, those absent include two companies with the deepest pockets: Meta, whose Llama family of models is released partly open (“We were snubbed,” posted Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun on X) and Musk’s xAI, whose Grok-1 model was released with an open-source license; Musk is also suing OpenAI for its lack of open-source models. But open-source advocates such as Hugging Face and Databricks are also missing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an era in which the power to shape AI may ultimately be concentrated in the hands of the wealthiest tech companies, the question is: Who gets to decide whether and what kinds of AI systems are safe and secure? Can (and should) these companies be a part of regulating an industry where they have clear vested interests?\n\nSome, like AI researcher Timnit Gebru, say no: “Foxes guarding the hen house is an understatement,” she posted on X. But Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security, told the Wall Street Journal that he was unconcerned that the board’s membership included many Big Tech execs. “They understand the mission of this board,” he said. “This is not a mission that is about business development.”\n\nOf course, a board dedicated to deploying AI within America’s critical infrastructure does need input from the companies that will be deploying it—which obviously includes hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft, as well as AI model leaders like OpenAI. But the debate between those who believe that Big Tech wants to snuff out AI competition and those who think AI regulation should limit open-source AI is also not new: It has been hot and heavy ever since OpenAI’sAltman testified before Congress in June 2023, urging AI regulation—which my colleague Jeremy Kahn wisely said would be “definitely good for OpenAI” while others called his lobbying “a masterclass in wooing policy makers.”\n\nIn November 2023, the Washington Post reported that a growing group of venture capitalists, CEOs of mid-sized software companies, and open-source proponents are pushing back. They argue the biggest AI players simply want to lock in their advantages with rules and regulations like Biden’s executive order, which lays out a plan for government testing and approval guidelines for AI models.\n\nAnd if the U.K. is any example, the group has valid concerns about BigTech’s willingness to be transparent. Politico reported yesterday that while last year Altman and Musk agreed to share their companies’ AI models with the British government, as part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s new AI Safety Institute, they so far have not. For example, the report claimed that neither OpenAI nor Meta has given the U.K.'s AI Safety Institute access to do pre-release testing—showing the limits of voluntary commitments.\n\nHowever, with Congressional AI regulations showing few signs of progress, many leaders consider any move towards tackling the “responsible development and deployment of AI” to be a step in the right direction. On the other hand, open-source AI is not going anywhere—so it seems clear that its leaders and proponents will ultimately have to be part of the plan.\n\nWith that, here’s the AI news.\n\nSharon Goldman sharon.goldman@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Dozens of Google workers who were fired after internal protests surrounding a lucrative contract that the technology company has with the Israeli government have filed a complaint with labor regulators in an attempt to get their jobs back.\n\nThe complaint filed late Monday with the National Labor Relations Board alleges about 50 workers were unfairly fired or placed on administrative leave earlier this month in the aftermath of employee sit-ins that occurred at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California. The protests targeted a $1.2 billion deal known as Project Nimbus that provides artificial intelligence technology to the Israeli government. The fired works contend the system is being lethally deployed in the Gaza war — an allegation Google refutes.\n\nGoogle jettisoned the workers' “participation (or perceived participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly connected to their terms and conditions of work.”\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board didn't immediately set a timetable for reviewing the case.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(New throughout, adds number of employees and other details from complaint)\n\nBy Daniel Wiessner\n\nApril 30 (Reuters) - A group of workers at Alphabet Inc's Google have filed a complaint with a U.S. labor board claiming the tech company unlawfully fired about 50 employees for protesting its cloud contract with the Israeli government.\n\nThe single-page complaint filed late Monday with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that by firing the workers, Google interfered with their rights under U.S. labor law to advocate for better working conditions.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle this month said it had fired 28 employees who disrupted work at unspecified office locations while protesting Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract jointly awarded to Google and Amazon.com to supply the Israeli government with cloud services. The company last week said that about 20 more workers had been fired for protesting the contract while in the office.\n\nThe workers claim the project supports Israel's development of military tools. Google has said the Nimbus contract \"is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\"\n\nZelda Montes, a former Google employee who was arrested during a protest of Project Nimbus, said Google fired workers to suppress organizing and send a message to its workforce that dissent would not be tolerated.\n\n“Google is attempting to instill fear in employees,\" Montes said in a statement provided by No Tech For Apartheid, an organizing group affiliated with some of the fired workers.\n\nThe workers in the NLRB complaint are seeking to be reinstated to their jobs with back pay and a statement from Google that it will not violate workers' rights to organize.\n\nThe NLRB general counsel, which acts as a prosecutor, reviews complaints and attempts to settle claims it finds to have merit. If that fails, the general counsel can pursue cases before administrative judges and a five-member board appointed by the U.S. president.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s “show-me” moment will arrive on Tuesday when its earnings become the latest litmus test on appetite for heavy artificial intelligence spending.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Binance and CZ’s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Even in Jail Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System S&P 500 Falls 1% at End of Worst Month in 2024: Markets Wrap Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter\n\nThe message so far from investors: shares of firms that demonstrate progress in monetizing AI will be rewarded, while firms that don’t will see their stock price punished.\n\nLast week’s misfire by Meta Platforms Inc. triggered a roughly $400 billion selloff in tech stocks amid concerns about the benefits of heavy spending on artificial intelligence. Later results from Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. eased those fears.\n\nWhen Amazon reports, scrutiny will be on its web services segment, where it uses generative AI. Options traders are pricing in a move of nearly 8% in either direction for the stock a day after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“It’s all about AWS, how much they’re maintaining market share and then what they’re doing in AI to increase the bottom line,” said Paul Marino of GraniteShares.\n\n“Amazon has an incredibly steady retail business and that’s all great and they’re a dominant player — but none of that means anything if what they’re doing in the cloud, and what they’re going to do with AI, doesn’t bear fruit.”\n\nShares of Amazon fell as much as 1.4% on Tuesday, after advancing 4% over the previous two trading days.\n\nAmazon believes generative AI cloud services can generate billions in revenue in the coming years, and has invested heavily in the technology to ramp up.\n\nCrucial to how well its report is received is how Amazon communicates its outlook, with Meta’s slump last week partly coming down to what investors regarded as a lack of clarity. That’s key at a time when traders are rapidly reassessing whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.\n\n“They were not very clear about what the next couple of quarters look like, they were not very clear about what AI gains will mean to them in terms of profitability,” said Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., of Meta.\n\n“The focus is a little bit less right now, I think, on the near term results from the last quarter,” he added. “It’s more about what is your guidance looking like, knowing that interest rates are now going to be higher for longer.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Alphabet’s Cash Boom Is Raising Dividend Hopes on Wall Street\n\nThe last few megacap earnings reports have also put the return of capital to shareholders in focus. Google parent Alphabet’s share price jump last week was also driven by its announcement of a new dividend and additional $70 billion in buybacks in its earnings release.\n\nThat leaves Amazon as the final big tech company that doesn’t currently offer a dividend. Investors are awaiting a potential announcement, alongside a possible expansion of its buyback program.\n\nAmazon is well-liked by Wall Street, with no analyst sell recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average price target implies more than 17% upside from current levels.\n\nStill, if Amazon doesn’t meet expectations in the quarter or fails to give solid-enough commentary, Meta’s earnings rout offers an uncomfortable example of where investor sentiment currently lies.\n\n“It’s priced to perfection. It’s an unbelievable company, it’s a monopoly and very macro-related. I just think it’s over-owned,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\n\n“AWS has to see material acceleration,” or Amazon stock will be sold, Mortonson said.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nThe US push to ban TikTok marks a new phase in its approach to data security that could eventually impact everything from electric vehicles to health care, reshaping trade relations between the world’s biggest economies. Huawei Technologies Co.’s profit rose for the fourth consecutive quarter, a sign the Chinese tech company is taking market share from Apple Inc. and other smartphone rivals. Meta’s social media platforms Facebook and Instagram are under investigation from the European Union amid concerns they’re failing to cull targeted disinformation peddled by Russia that aims to sow discord on the continent. Samsung Electronics Co. topped analyst earnings estimates after its semiconductor division returned to profitability, as companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. led a surge in spending on artificial intelligence services. Microsoft Corp. will invest $1.7 billion to build out cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Indonesia, betting on Southeast Asia’s biggest economy to spur growth.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nPayPal Gartner Corning Zebra Tech CommVault IPG Photonics ACI Worldwide Postmarket\n\nAmazon AMD Super Micro Computer Pinterest Skyworks CCC Intelligent Solutions Littelfuse Blackbaud Mirion Technologies A10 Networks\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\n(Updates share move in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India’s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 25, 2024\n\nAlphabet Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.89, expectations were $1.51.\n\nOperator: Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai: Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that, as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion.\n\nThis shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI -first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that built AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large -scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code, and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as imagine visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nBuilding world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100 times more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure.\n\nYou can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models, and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations and Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we have been experimenting with SGE and Search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the Search experience, while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants.\n\nWe have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways, and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image, or object in a video, and get an AI overview with lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100 -plus countries.\n\nThis gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful Gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages, and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity and execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader.\n\nAnd last week, we took another step bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating market. We continue to manage our headcount growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement, and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs.\n\nWe remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.\n\nAt Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart, and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available, and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and ARM-based CPU.\n\nIn benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than compatible x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models, and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers, as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\n\nIn Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University, and Penny Mac are using Gemini in Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for meetings and messaging and Gemini security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence, and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days.\n\nTurning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube shots. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million music and premium subscribers globally, including trailers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix, with high customer satisfaction and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin.\n\nOverall, it was a great quarter and there's more to come. iOS is in less than three weeks, followed by Brand cast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philip?\n\nPhilipp Schindler: Thanks, Sundar. And hi, everyone. Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on -year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical, with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types.\n\nWe've talked about how solutions like smart bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand, and how products like Broad Match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors Gen AI's opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into P-Max. A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nIt's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet P-Max asset requirements instantly. This is available to all US advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using P-Max asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their P-Max ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with Gen AI. Those adopting ACA see an average 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Demand Gen. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail, and Discover.\n\nHollywood Film and TV Studio Lionsgate partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type would deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games, Ballad of Songbirds, and Snakes Film. Over a three week test, Demand Gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks, with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out Demand Gen for two new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to Demand Gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about.\n\nI'll add that innovation in the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again a top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline, as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences.\n\nHighlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, P-Max, or both. Take Home Goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across Search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in Omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options, and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube.\n\nLast quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences, and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over 70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both shorts and CTV.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12 plus months. In the first quarter, living room benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music, and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth.\n\nOn the ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, living room, and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a Pause Ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content.\n\nInitial results show that Pause Ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across Cloud and Ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open. WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including the Coca -Cola company, L 'Oreal, and Nestle.\n\nWe're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brand cast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up.\n\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Philip. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, driven in particular by strength in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15%, or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion, as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAs you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines and other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube, given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues was up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting first in R&D an increase in compensation expense primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud, and second in sales and marketing a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%.\n\nNet income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, within Google services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%. Let again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\n\nTAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services, first within advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our ads businesses.\n\nSearch had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration and revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out. First, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength and spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter. Second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices, we continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line.\n\nThe sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance and play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth.\n\nAs we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet. First, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than one point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter. Second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring.\n\nAs we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind, and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers.\n\nThe significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion authorization and share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business, as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary opportunities ahead.\n\nWe view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. Thank you. Sundar, Phillip and I will now take your questions.\n\nSee also\n\n11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024 and\n\nTop 12 Ultra-High Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - A group of workers at Alphabet Inc's Google have filed a complaint with a U.S. labor board claiming the tech company unlawfully fired them for protesting its cloud contract with the Israeli government.\n\nThe complaint was filed late Monday with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), according to No Tech For Apartheid, a group affiliated with some of the workers. The group said the complaint alleges that by firing the workers, Google interfered with their rights under U.S. labor law to advocate for better working conditions.\n\nReuters could not immediately obtain a copy of the complaint. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle this month said it had fired 28 employees who disrupted work at unspecified office locations while protesting Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract jointly awarded to Google and Amazon.com to supply the Israeli government with cloud services.\n\nThe workers claim the project supports Israel's development of military tools. Google has said the Nimbus contract \"is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\"\n\nZelda Montes, a former Google employee who was arrested during a protest of Project Nimbus, said in a statement that Google fired workers to suppress organizing and send a message to its workforce that dissent would not be tolerated.\n\n“Google is attempting to instill fear in employees,\" Montes said.\n\nThe workers in the NLRB complaint are seeking to be reinstated to their jobs with back pay, and a statement from Google that it will not violate workers' rights to organize.\n\nThe NLRB general counsel, which acts as a prosecutor, reviews complaints and attempts to settle claims it finds to have merit. If that fails, the general counsel can pursue cases before administrative judges and a five-member board appointed by the U.S. president.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and David Gregorio)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) exceeded Wall Street expectations in their latest quarterly results, driven by a surge in cloud revenue fueled by increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) services, Bloomberg reported. Alphabet’s shares soared up to 12%, marking its biggest gain since July 2015 and pushing its valuation past $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Microsoft rose as much as 3.5%. Still, there are some cloud computing stocks for investors to sell in this climate.\n\nThe bear case for these companies is that there could be high opportunity costs for holding onto them. Alternatives like MSFT and GOOG could prove to be too attractive. They offer the promise of high returns and being at the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these cloud computing stocks peaked during the pandemic and failed to return to Earth. That means they are still overvalued in comparison to their long-term growth potential. So here are three cloud computing stocks to avoid.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) may experience challenges in maintaining its rapid growth rate as its post-pandemic reality starts to sink in.\r\n\r\nZM reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations. Earnings at $1.42 per share on an adjusted basis were up 16% year-over-year while revenue reached $1.146 billion, a 2.6% increase from the previous year. This outperformance was attributed to the solid adoption of Zoom’s new Contact Center offering, upmarket traction, Zoom Phone and recent AI capabilities.\n\nStill, I believe that ZM’s valuation is presently too high to justify its stock price at around $62 per share. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is rich at 29.95 times earnings, not that much different from Microsoft at 35 times. Framing this is that MSFT’s growth potential is far higher according to analysts. Its revenue is expected to climb 17% while Zoom is only expected to rise around 5%.\n\nThe opportunity cost of holding onto ZM may be too steep when one compares what else the market has to offer, along with it being traded at a premium to its earnings.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) operates in a highly competitive cloud data warehousing market, facing challenges in differentiating its offerings and maintaining profitability.\n\nThe cloud data warehousing market is crowded with competitors like Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Redshift, Google BigQuery and Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse. These established players already have a significant market share and robust offerings, making it difficult for Snowflake to differentiate itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the underlying technology used in data warehousing solutions has become increasingly standardized. Many competitors offer similar features and functionalities, making an apple-to-apples comparison exceedingly easier.\n\nPerhaps due to SNOW’s lack of a durable competitive advantage, its earnings have been consistently negative. However, analysts expect it could break even within the next 12 months, but then its shares would trade at a high premium, as its forward price-to-sales ratio is 187 times earnings at the time of writing.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) faces concerns about intensifying competition in the cloud computing space.\n\nCompeting with major players like Microsoft and AWS requires Salesforce to continuously innovate and enhance its offerings to stay ahead. Unfortunately, considering who it’s up against, its top-line is unsustainable.\n\nCRM’s revenue growth peaked in 2019 and has gradually found a bottom. This bottom is not expected to be reached until FY2024, and even then that’s a speculative guess as it’s currently in free fall.\n\nCRM’s valuation is also very rich at 65 times earnings. Its balance sheet strength is also dicey with $14.19 billion in cash and $12.59 billion in debt.\n\nThere was a time that CRM dominated the cloud computing market in its respective niches. However, I think that those days are long over. It may earn a spot in one’s portfolio, but I think its high valuation makes it a prime target for an attack by short sellers, especially if the market goes thru a cyclical downturn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) appears an attractive pick given a noticeable improvement in the company's earnings outlook. The stock has been a strong performer lately, and the momentum might continue with analysts still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this company is driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are plowing into technology-tracking ETFs at a record clip as conviction builds that the market’s biggest stocks can thrive in almost any economic cycle.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter Binance and CZ’s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Jail or no Jail Cocoa Plunges Most Ever With Trader Exodus Sparking Huge Moves\n\nAs fears of sticky inflation and climbing bond yields stalk markets, traders have been shoveling money into big tech all year, lured by best-in-class earnings growth and strong balance sheets. Tech exchange-traded funds have absorbed about $9.2 billion so far in 2024, the most of any other sector by a margin of nearly $7 billion.\n\nAppetite is building for big tech as investors increasingly buy into the idea that the megacaps can fit into almost any box: growth strategies, haven bids or income plays. Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. were powerful reminders of that narrative, with the latter introducing its first-ever dividend after both companies crushed earnings estimates and helped propel the S&P 500 to its best weekly performance of the year.\n\nNow, as the Federal Reserve looks to keep interest rates at elevated levels to combat stubborn inflation, the thinking goes that profitable tech companies will be able to handle the pressure.\n\n“We would be focusing very strongly on those companies which have the pricing power, cash flow, strong balance sheets, are able to out-compete the others in their sector. Which actually takes you back to tech,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “Whichever way you slice and dice it, we continue to like that megacap tech space.”\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet delivered first-quarter revenue that topped expectations and reports that were strong enough to help “offset concerns over the US economic outlook,” UBS Global Wealth Management wrote. All told, tech revenue is expected to rise 8.6% for the quarter, more than double the 3.5% gain anticipated for the broader S&P 500, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe thesis of big tech prevailing through rain or shine has been tested by volatility in Tesla Inc.’s shares, as electric-vehicle demand cools. Meta Platforms Inc.’s stunning rally was also brake-checked by a less-than-inspiring revenue outlook.\n\nStill, the $253 million Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (ticker MAGS) has soared nearly 18% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 that gained 7.3% and 5.4%, respectively, as of Monday’s close.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Apple Inc. — which reports earnings on Thursday — has been plagued by reports of weakening Chinese demand for iPhones, economic struggles in any one country won’t leave too deep of a dent, according to Annex Wealth Management’s Brian Jacobsen.\n\n“A lot of them have so much heft and such global presence that they aren’t necessarily beholden to a downturn or slowdown in China or Europe, or even the United States,” Jacobsen, the firm’s chief economist, said on Bloomberg Television. “They are macro agnostic, provided we don’t have a synchronized downturn.”\n\nThe biggest tech names have exhibited dominant performance even as yields on 10-year Treasuries have climbed to nearly 4.7% from about 3.90% at the start of the year, defying conventional wisdom that rising rates would weigh these companies down. But the reality is that the megacap cohort has relatively low debt levels and aren’t as interest-rate sensitive as compared to most companies, Principal’s Shah said.\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful display of big tech’s staying power has been the introduction of dividend payments, which have traditionally been a feature of more mature and slow-growing companies. Meta announced its first such payout earlier this year, followed by Alphabet’s inaugural dividend announcement last week. Among the six largest US tech companies, Amazon.com Inc. — which releases earnings after the market close on Tuesday — is the only one without a quarterly payout.\n\n“When people start to talk about walking away from tech, you can’t really walk away from that kind of cash generation and that kind of growth,” Sarah Hunt, chief market strategist at Alpine Saxon Woods, said on Bloomberg Television. “What you’re seeing generated right now is that growth can continue and it can ramp itself up in ways that people weren’t quite expecting. That really saved equity markets.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India’s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google Announces Layoffs Across Key Teams As It Gears Up For I/O Developer Conference\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, ahead of its annual I/O developer conference in May, has confirmed layoffs across various vital teams such as Flutter, Dart, Python, and others, according to employee reports on social media.\n\nThe tech giant did not specify the teams, roles, or the number of individuals affected, TechCrunch reports.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Alex García-Kummert explained that these changes aim to align resources with the company’s most significant product priorities, improve efficiency, and reduce bureaucracy.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet Ramp Up AI Investments, Spend Over $32B in Q1\n\nThe layoffs are part of regular organizational adjustments and are not company-wide. Google encourages those affected to apply for other available positions within the company.\n\nDespite the cuts, Google PM Kevin Moore assured the Flutter development community that they are still focused on upcoming projects, including new updates for Flutter at the I/O conference.\n\nThe company has also filed a WARN notice in California, indicating the layoff of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.\n\nIn 2024, the tech sector surpassed last year’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs.\n\nThis comes after nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Discord, Salesforce Inc (NASDAQ:CRM), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) have announced significant layoffs in January.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory situation. Firstly, the rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.\n\nGOOG shares gained 56% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story)\n\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Big Tech is paying for its AI bets: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOptimism about the potential of AI to transform the tech industry has resulted in a dash to increase investment. Look no further than the income statement of Nvidia (NVDA) for signs of how frenetic this pace has been.\n\nThe share prices of the market's biggest tech companies making these investments also reveal that investors have been generally receptive to the idea.\n\nAnd how management teams have gotten investors on board with the idea that spending billions against AI opportunities that might still be elusive is simple: They're also getting paid.\n\nTake Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), for example.\n\nIn 2023, the company spent a little over $32 billion on capital expenditures, which they define in their annual report as spending that \"primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure.\" In 2022, capex spending totaled $31.5 billion.\n\nGenerally, this is money spent on chips, servers, and raw computing power to run what we experience as the company's suite of services — Search, YouTube, Gmail, and so on.\n\nAs AI overwhelmed any other strategic investment Alphabet may have contemplated for itself, this spending ramped considerably.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company's capex spending hit $12 billion. On a call with investors last week, CFO Ruth Porat said, \"We expect quarterly capex throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level.\"\n\nPorat cautioned that this spending can be lumpy. But that annualized rate of spending — $48 billion — is about 50% higher than what the company spent in each of the last two years.\n\nTo get investors on board with this approach, the company is offering a bounty. Ruth Porat, CFO, Alphabet and Google, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 2, 2022, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nAlphabet initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, the first regular dividend in the company's history. Its share buyback authorization was also increased by $70 billion, in addition to the $20 billion available under its existing program.\n\nAt its current share count, this dividend will cost Alphabet a little less than $10 billion per year in cash, paid out to shareholders. In the first quarter, Alphabet repurchased $16.1 billion worth of its own stock.\n\nIncreasing share buybacks will bring the cash-out spending on dividends down a smidge as repurchased shares are retired, but if the company roughly keeps up its current pace of repurchases, then quarterly shareholder returns should fall somewhere between $18 billion and $19 billion. On an annual basis, these figures should run closer to $75 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Alphabet's annual capex spending set to rise by at least $16 billion in 2024, investors are more than making up for it.\n\nNow, as Meta (META) learned last week, this support can be fickle.\n\nIts stock fell more than 10% after raising its forecast for spending this year, a move that came just three months after investors cheered Meta for the same initiative Alphabet announced last week — instating a dividend and increasing its buyback authorization.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors the company's first quarter results indicated the company \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest-scale AI services in the world.\"\n\n\"But realistically,\" he added, \"even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\n\nAt least in the interim, investors will get paid for the privilege of waiting. A perhaps unexpected benefit from the AI boom.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE and Marriott International, Inc. MAR.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Alphabet and Amazon.com\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc. and Marriott International, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Meet the Newest Dividend Stock in the Nasdaq 100. It Could Be a $4 Trillion Company by 2030, With Help From Artificial Intelligence.",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) had more than $110 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of 2023. The company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and capital expenditures are projected to climb 27% this year from a record $32 billion last year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, several Wall Street analysts saw that cash pile as evidence that Alphabet was preparing to pay a dividend. Lo and behold, when the company reported first-quarter earnings results last week, management announced a dividend of $0.20 per share payable on June 17 to stockholders of record on June 10.\n\nThat makes Alphabet the newest dividend stock in the Nasdaq 100, an index that tracks the 100 largest companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. But investors shouldn't interpret that news to mean Alphabet lacks growth prospects. On the contrary, its market capitalization could reach $4 trillion by 2030, implying 90% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAlphabet looked strong in the first quarter\n\nAlphabet reported stellar financial results in the first quarter, easily surpassing what Wall Street expected on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to particularly strong momentum in Google Cloud, the product category that includes cloud infrastructure and platform services, and the business productivity suite called Google Workspace.\n\nAlphabet has been optimizing its cost base by focusing on the most compelling product development opportunities and rightsizing its workforce. That strategy continued to bear fruit in the first quarter. Operating margin expanded 700 basis points (7 percentage points) and GAAP net income jumped 62% to $1.89 per diluted share.\n\nThe chart below provides more detail on first-quarter revenue growth across Alphabet's four primary product categories. The chart shows Alphabet's revenue growth by product category in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGoing forward, management sees substantial growth opportunities in search advertising and cloud computing, especially where artificial intelligence (AI) is concerned. CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.\"\n\nRegarding its footprint, Alphabet has six products that serve more than 2 billion monthly users -- think Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. That gives the company deep insight into consumer tastes and preferences, and that data informs its machine learning models to improve campaign outcomes for media buyers. Additionally, Alphabet's newest generative AI model, Gemini, lets advertisers build campaigns and create relevant media assets (images and text) with natural language prompts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond advertising, Alphabet's Gemini model lets developers build generative AI applications in Google Cloud, and it automates tasks across Google Workspace applications. For instance, Gemini can draft text in Google Docs, create media content in Google Slides, and organize data in Google Sheets.\n\nAlphabet has growth opportunities in digital advertising and cloud computing\n\nAlphabet has two significant growth engines in digital advertising and cloud computing. The company is expected to lose share across the broader advertising market in the coming years, but it will still account for roughly 27% of digital ad spending in 2025, about 490 basis points more than its nearest competitor Meta Platforms, according to eMarketer.\n\nIn particular, Alphabet remains well positioned in search and video advertising. Google dominates internet search with more than 91% market share, and YouTube is the most popular streaming service as measured by viewing time. Notably, some investors have expressed concern that generative AI could erode Google's search dominance, but Alphabet is leaning into that trend with Search Generative Experience (SGE).\n\nSGE applies generative AI to Google Search to help users understand topics more quickly and deeply, while prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. Pichai provided an update on the latest earnings call. \"We are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews, as well as increased user satisfaction with the results,\" he said.\n\nIn cloud computing, Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is not as large as Amazon Web Services, nor is it gaining market share as quickly as Microsoft Azure. However, GCP has gained ground in recent years. It accounted for 11% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 1 point from 2021 and 3 points from 2019.\n\nGoing forward, GCP could continue to gain market share in the cloud as Gemini and other AI products see greater adoption. Indeed, Pichai alluded to that possibility during the latest earnings call. \"We have the best infrastructure for the AI era,\" he said. \"More than 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and nearly 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\"\n\nWhy Alphabet could be a $4 trillion company by 2030\n\nWall Street expects Alphabet to grow revenue at 10.5% annually over the next five years. I think that leaves room for upside, especially if Alphabet continues to gain market share in cloud computing. I say that because the online advertising and cloud computing market are projected to expand at 16% annually and 14% annually, respectively, through 2030.\n\nThat gives Alphabet a reasonable shot at sales growth of 12% annually through the end of the decade. At that pace, trailing-12-month revenue would reach $628 billion in six years, such that the company would have a market capitalization of $4 trillion if shares traded at 6.4 times sales. That would be a discount to the current valuation of 7.2 times sales, and it would roughly align with the three-year average of 6.3 times sales.\n\nIf Alphabet's market capitalization does reach $4 trillion in six years, that would mean 90% upside for investors, which works out to an annual return of 11.3%. That makes this Magnificent Seven stock a compelling long-term investment idea.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Following a volatile start to the decade, the bulls are, once again, running wild on Wall Street. Despite a modest pullback, investors have witnessed the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite jump to record-closing highs within the last five weeks.\n\nWhile there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors since this new bull market took shape, the Magnificent Seven have done the lion's share of the heavy lifting. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are long-term outperformers with well-defined competitive advantages\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of Wall Street's largest and most-influential businesses. Listed in descending order by market cap, as of the closing bell on April 26, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nAside from all seven of these companies crushing the S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, their lure, from an investment standpoint, is their competitive advantages and/or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging the old with the new. Windows is still the world's leading operating system for desktops, while Azure is the global No. 2 cloud-infrastructure service platform. Apple's calling card to success has long been its iPhone, which accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to make up in the neighborhood of 90% of the GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet's Google comprised more than 91% of global internet-search share in March, while streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world. Amazon's online marketplace is No. 1 in the U.S., with an estimated 37.6% of domestic online retail share in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud-infrastructure service platform. Meta Platforms owns the top social media sites globally, including Facebook, which attract more than 3.2 billion daily active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nBut there's a new draw to the Magnificent Seven that didn't exist when 2024 began: Most of these companies now pay a dividend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay a regular dividend to their shareholders\n\nWhen most investors think of the Magnificent Seven, they probably envision Wall Street's steadiest growth stocks. With these businesses aggressively reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth segments and innovations, collecting dividend income is likely an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, operating cash flow has been so robust for most of these companies that paying a regular dividend can be done without hampering their innovative capacity in any way.\n\nEntering 2024, three Magnificent Seven constituents had been paying a dividend to their shareholders for years.\n\nMicrosoft has been paying a continuous quarterly dividend since September 2004 and has seen its payout grow by more than 800% since its dividend program was first initiated. Apple reinstated its quarterly-dividend program in the summer of 2012 and has increased its payout by 154% in under 12 years. Nvidia has paid what currently amounts to a token dividend ($0.04 per quarter) dating back to the summer of 2013.\n\nIn February, Meta Platforms joined the party when its board introduced a $0.50 per-quarter distribution. Even with aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality devices, and the metaverse, Meta closed out the March quarter with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated over $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations during the quarter. It has the balance sheet and capital to support a continuous payout to its shareholders.\n\nLast week, Alphabet became the newest member of the club. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and now-profitable cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, initiated a $0.20 per-quarter dividend. Alphabet ended March with over $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated an astounding $28.8 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of the new year. It can easily absorb this annual payout while fueling its cloud and AI-driven ambitions.\n\nLater today, Tuesday, April 30, a sixth member of the Magnificent Seven has an opportunity to join the club.\n\nIs this the newest dividend-paying Magnificent Seven stock?\n\nLast week, Tesla's operating results made it plainly evident that it won't be doling out a dividend anytime soon to its shareholders. Tesla endured a free-cash outflow of $2.53 billion during the first quarter, with EV competition heating up and multiple rounds of price cuts wrecking the company's operating margin. Selling a commoditized product in a cyclical industry might make it difficult for Tesla to ever pay a dividend.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven component that could become the newest dividend paying stock in mere hours is Amazon -- the company is slated to report its first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today.\n\nWith Amazon stock trading at a multiple of 62 times trailing-12-month earnings, you might be quick to dismiss the likelihood of the company doling out a dividend to its shareholders. However, Amazon's balance sheet, and its three ancillary operating segments that are bona fide cash machines, suggest it can become the next income stock.\n\nWhen the curtain closed on 2023, Amazon was sitting on a treasure chest of nearly $86.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. More importantly, net cash provided by operating activities soared to nearly $85 billion in 2023 from $46.8 billion in the previous year. By 2027, Amazon's three higher-margin ancillary segments -- AWS, advertising services, and subscription services -- are expected to more than double the company's 2023 operating cash flow.\n\nAlthough advertising can be cyclical, Amazon's operating cash flow is fairly insulated against downturns in the U.S. and global economy. While e-commerce generates most of its revenue, the online marketplace is a low-margin segment. The predictability of subscription-services revenue, coupled with enterprise cloud spending still being early in its ramp, all but ensures that Amazon will have more capital than it'll know what to do with.\n\nDon't overlook peer pressure as a catalyst, either. With Meta and Alphabet introducing a dividend over the last three months, Amazon may have little choice but to follow suit in order to maintain its seat at the table among America's most-influential businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon is set to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nE-commerce firm Amazon is set to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday in what will be a closely watched quarter for tech companies' progress in the AI sector.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street expect revenue of $142.6bn (£113.8bn) versus the $127.4bn in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share are predicted at $0.82, more than double the $0.31 in Q1 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, online stores, Amazon Web Services and advertising are all expected to have grown.\n\nThe company has said it sees the potential for AI initiatives to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders earlier this month: \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nRead more: Amazon earnings preview: AI initiatives expected to take focus\n\nLike its competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon is wielding its heft in its cloud computing business to gain an edge in the nascent AI market. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to supply vital infrastructure.\n\nSimilar to other deals between tech giants and AI-focused companies, Amazon's partnership with Anthropic comes with a commitment to use its cloud computing services — highlighting an advantage of trillion-dollar companies as they attempt to dominate the coming AI era.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla stock finished more than 15% higher on Monday ahead of news that CEO Elon Musk has reportedly shaken up its top ranks and set layoffs in motion. According to a report by The Information, which saw internal documents, Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of new products are set to leave.\n\nMeanwhile all employees that report to Ho and Tinucci will be laid off, the report added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe news comes following reports that the company has clinched key approvals in China to introduce the company's self-driving software to the market.\n\nReuters reported on Monday, citing two sources, that, Tesla had reached an agreement with Baidu (BIDU) to use the Chinese tech firm's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe collection and storage of Chinese data, and how much of it is allowed back into the US has been a key concern for years with the interaction of US companies on Chinese soil, or visa versa.\n\nMusk is looking to obtain approval to transfer data collected in the country abroad to train algorithms for its autonomous driving technologies, a source told Reuters.\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nElectronics firm Samsung beat earnings estimates as its chip division returned to profit, reporting a net income for that division of 6.62 trillion won ($4.8bn) in the quarter to the end of March, versus the average analyst projection for 5.63 trillion won. It more than quadrupled its earnings from a year earlier off the back of the AI boom.\n\nRead more: HSBC beats estimates and announces buyback as CEO retires unexpectedly\n\nThe company's fortunes have been buffeted by macroeconomic uncertainty in recent years, with heavy losses in 2023 in its semiconductor unit. However, demand for chips is higher than ever, with the rise of companies hoping to cash in on the wave of AI innovation which has been led by the likes of OpenAI.\n\nSamsung said it expects chip demand to remain strong in the current quarter and the second half of this year.\n\nMercedes-Benz (MBG.DE)\n\nLuxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz left its guidance unchanged for the year and said it would continue share buybacks as its earnings dropped 34% in the first quarter.\n\nPoor demand for electric vehicles was behind the lag, with earnings before interest and tax dropping to $3.9bn.\n\nThe company expects an increase in sales in the coming quarters, with an improvement in the Chinese market.\n\nWhitbread (WTB.L)\n\nWhitbread stock gained more than 1% in early trade in London on Tuesday as the Premier Inn owner announced it would close restaurant chains and cut 1,500 jobs. Whitbread will sell 126 of its less profitable branded restaurants, while job cuts are still being decided with a consultation process having been launched.\n\nThe closures come in favour of building more hotel rooms, the company said. The latest results show pre-tax profit rose 21% to £452m for the year ending 29 February.\n\nWatch: Amazon earnings: All eyes on cloud growth for AWS?<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AMZN</a>) will report its first quarter earnings alongside other tech giants like Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AAPL</a>) this week. Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination to discuss Amazon's upcoming earnings and why investors should pay attention to how Amazon Web Services performs.</p>\\n<p>On what to expect with AWS, Bajarin states: \\\"Everybody is going to be looking at cloud growth for AWS. Right now,  it's super trendy to talk about CapEx, everyone wants to see what the hyperscalers are spending in terms of new infrastructure, buying AI servers, creating 'AI factories,' as Nvidia (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">NVDA</a>) likes to call them. I think that's what's going to be a big spotlight, what Amazon's growth is doing in terms of AWS. I think it's probably predictable it will be healthy, somewhat double-digit.

        "content": "After Alphabet’s GOOGL exhilarating quarterly results last week, Wall Street will be eying its big tech peer and cloud computing rival Amazon’s AMZN Q1 report on Tuesday, April 30.\n\nMore so than Alphabet, Amazon’s stock has been on an ascending course to hit $200 a share after their 20-for-1 stock splits in 2022 and investors may be wondering if it's time to buy as earnings approach.\n\nQ1 Preview\n\nAmazon’s Q1 earnings are thought to come in at $0.81 per share which would be a 161% increase from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, Q1 sales are projected to rise 12% to $142.55 billion.\n\nNotably, Amazon has exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for five consecutive quarters and has posted an impressive average earnings surprise of 51.04% in its last four quarterly reports. Furthermore, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Amazon could exceed earnings expectations again with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q1 EPS at $0.87 and 7% above the Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud Expansion\n\nOutside of its commanding e-commerce business, Amazon’s AWS still controls the primary share of the domestic cloud computing market ahead of Microsoft’s MSFT Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud. According to Zacks estimates, AWS segment sales are expected to rise 13% to $24.25 billion versus $21.35 billion in Q1 2023.\n\nEdging Towards $200 a Share\n\nAmazon’s stock has risen +19% this year with a current stock price of $180 a share and has matched Alphabet’s YTD performance with GOOGL having a current price of $166. Over the last year, AMZN has now soared +77% to slightly top GOOGL at +55%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nThe catalyst for Amazon’s stock edging closer to $200 a share has been the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions. Over the last 60 days, fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates have now risen 1% and 2% respectively, and are slightly up in the last week.\n\nEven better, Amazon’s annual earnings are currently projected to rise 42% this year to $4.12 per share with another 31% EPS growth expected in FY25. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAmazon’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). To that point, the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions ahead of its Q1 report is compelling along with the Zack ESP suggesting the Magnificent Seven titan should top bottom line expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia’s Woes Are Your Windfall: 3 AI Stocks to Grab Now",
        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia’s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock’s foundation’s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment’s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker’s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm’s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta’s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world’s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML’s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Chip giant AMD (AMD) will report its first-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. The announcement follows rival Intel’s disappointing report last week. While Intel (INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines, the company provided lower than anticipated revenue guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding.\n\nInvestors and analysts will be looking at two key metrics during AMD’s report: AI chip sales and PC market performance. The company released its MI300 line of AI accelerators in Dec. 2023 and began shipping units shortly thereafter. How well those chips are selling could have a large impact on AMD’s shares following the earnings announcement.\n\nWall Street expects earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That would mark a slight increase from the same quarter last year when AMD reported EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $5.35 billion.\n\nAMD’s MI300 chips are meant to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s (NVDA) best-selling H100 line of accelerators. The company previously said that its MI300X beats out Nvidia’s chips, a claim Nvidia rejected. Intel is also chasing Nvidia’s H100 platform with its Gaudi 3 accelerators.

(Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox Media) (Jerod Harris via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia, however, announced its follow up to the H100 in the form of its Blackwell platform during its GTC conference in March, which should offer better performance than its predecessor.\n\nThe AI arms race isn’t slowing anytime soon, either. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) each announced that they’re pouring money into AI data center capabilities to build out and support their various software offerings.\n\nBut whether AMD can steal significant market share away from market leader Nvidia remains to be seen. According to UBS Global Research analyst Timothy Arcuri, MI300X sales should bring in billions this year.\n\n“We still very much see $5 billion to $6 billion as still conservative for MI300 revenue this year and we also see guidance being fine,” he wrote in an investor note ahead of earnings.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is anticipating Data Center revenue of $2.31 billion, which would equate to a year-over-year increase of 78% versus the same period last year.\n\nOutside of AI sales, Wall Street will be looking at the recovery in the PC market and its impact on AMD’s sales. According to IDC, global PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter of 2024, marking the first quarter of growth after two years of declines.\n\nIntel already reported a 31% year-over-year bump in Client Group revenue, the company’s PC chip segment, in its latest quarter. That should bode well for AMD. Both companies are pushing their own AI PCs, or laptops and desktops that can run generative AI apps locally rather than via the web.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are calling for AMD Client revenue, the segment that includes PC chip sales, to jump 74% year-over-year to $1.29 billion in the quarter.\n\nBut Intel and AMD aren’t the only companies pushing for a slice of the AI PC market. Qualcomm (QCOM) is angling for its own cut with its new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips for laptop.\n\nDespite healthy growth projections for its Data Center and Client segments, Wall Street is expecting the company’s Gaming and Embedded divisions to tumble 45% and 40%, respectively.

        "content": "Monday, April 29, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+77.2% vs. +54.0%) reflecting the company's leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have modestly outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+23.1% vs. +20.0%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive.\r\n\r\nAlso, strength in YouTube contributed well. Notably, robust cloud division remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+18.2% vs. +10.6%) on the back of momentum in its Prime unit and the favorable outlook for its cloud business.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

        "title": "Interpreting Alphabet (GOOGL) International Revenue Trends",
        "content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Alphabet's (GOOGL) international operations for the quarter ending March 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this internet search leader, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\n\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\n\nUpon examining GOOGL's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $67.59 billion, experiencing an increase of 16.4% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of GOOGL's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\n\nUnveiling Trends in GOOGL's International Revenues\n\nDuring the quarter, APAC contributed $13.29 billion in revenue, making up 19.7% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $13.46 billion, this meant a surprise of -1.3%. Looking back, APAC contributed $13.98 billion, or 19.3%, in the previous quarter, and $11.68 billion, or 20.1%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOf the total revenue, $23.79 billion came from EMEA during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 35.2%. This represented a surprise of +1.65% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $23.4 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $25.01 billion, or 34.6%, and $21.08 billion, or 36.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nOther Americas accounted for 6.9% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $4.65 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +3.99%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.47 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other Americas contributed $5.18 billion (7.2%) and $4.08 billion (7%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Market Revenue Projections\n\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Alphabet will report a total revenue of $70.32 billion, which reflects an increase of 13.3% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 19.1% from APAC ($13.41 billion), 32.8% from EMEA ($23.08 billion) and 11.4% from Other Americas ($8.02 billion).\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $294.33 billion for the full year, marking an increase of 14.8% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from APAC, EMEA and Other Americas are projected to be 19.3% ($56.69 billion), 33.3% ($97.92 billion) and 8.9% ($26.15 billion) of the total revenue, in that order.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Alphabet faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\n\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\n\nAt Zacks, we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably, there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price.\n\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAssessing Alphabet's Stock Price Movement in Recent Times\n\nOver the past month, the stock has seen an increase of 13.9% in its value, whereas the Zacks S&P 500 composite has posted a decrease of 2%. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Alphabet's industry group, has descended 1.9% over the identical span. In the past three months, there's been an increase of 20.8% in the company's stock price, against a rise of 4.6% in the S&P 500 index. The broader sector has increased by 4.2% during this interval.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges",
        "content": "Microsoft Tops Estimates Across Its Business But Signals Near-Term Capacity Challenges\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) issued its third quarter earnings report.\n\nYear to date, Microsoft shares are 10% up, behind its tech rivals, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) that are 15% and 22% up, respectively, with the three locked in a battle to show who can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions.\n\nThis week, Microsoft got a pleasant boost from the beverage giant, The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) who agreed to infuse Microsoft’s  Azure cloud services and developing AI technology across its business and network.\n\nThird quarter results surpassed estimates.\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, revenue rose 17% YoY to $61.86 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $60.80 billion.\n\nNet income amounted to $21.94 billion or $2.94 per share and also surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $2.82 per share.\n\nOverall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s guidance for $33.93 billion. Intelligent Cloud segment brought in $26.71 billion as sales rose about 21% with Microsoft’s Azure cloud alone growing 31%. AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, rising from second quarter’s 6 percentage points and first quarter’s 3 percentage points.\n\nCapital expenditures jumped 79% to $14 billion. Microsoft has been investing heavily to secure Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units it needs to develop and train AI models. But even with all that investment, Microsoft has a shortage of data center infrastructure, specifically for deploying artificial intelligence models. CFO Amy Hood noted that AI demand could outstrip available capacity in the near-term. Microsoft is certainly not the only AI vendor with this challenge as Nvidia is facing the same issue. Fueled by the AI boom, Nvidia reported its revenue more than tripled over consecutive quarters. Microsoft, being one of its customers, is simply now feeling the stress Nvidia has been facing for a while due to insatiable AI demand. Only a month ago, Microsoft and Nvidia deepened their longstanding collaboration by announcing major integrations to accelerate the development of generative AI for enterprises.\n\nMore Personal Computing revenue rose 18% YoY to $15.58, surpassing StreetAccount consensus of $15.08 billion.  It was driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers, along with 62% growth in sales of Xbox content and services, with 61% being attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's October acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nStory continues\n\nPC demand was slightly better than expected during the quarter and consequently, sales of Windows licenses to device makers rose 11%.\n\nThe Productivity and Business Processes unit that hosts Office software and LinkedIn, among others, reported a revenue rise of 12% as sales amounted to $19.57 billion. This is first full quarter of the Copilot-add-on sales, on which Microsoft invested billions to develop.\n\nFourth quarter guidance was not as impressive.\n\nMicrosoft guided for revenue from $63.5 billion to $64.5 billion in the current quarter.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +13.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 11.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share, indicating a change of +21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.6%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 indicates a change of +15.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.3%. The $294.33 billion and $327.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.8% and +11.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy After Last Week's Big Moves: Alphabet, Meta, or Microsoft?",
        "content": "Earnings season is in full swing. To borrow from ABC's Wide World of Sports introduction from years ago, we can see \"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\" with companies' quarterly updates.\n\nSuch ups and downs were evident with several tech giants after they announced their quarterly results in recent days. Which is the best artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy after last week's big moves: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), or Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)?\n\nTwo victories, one defeat?\n\nIf we scored these three AI leaders based on their stock performances following their earnings updates last week, there would be two big victories and one defeat. The best news came from Google parent Alphabet, with the stock jumping close to 10% after the company announced its first-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nAlphabet's Q1 revenue rose 15% year over year to $80.5 billion. Earnings soared 57% higher to nearly $23.7 billion. The company's Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud businesses generated strong growth. Alphabet even pleasantly surprised investors by initiating a dividend for the first time.\n\nMicrosoft didn't wow investors quite as much but still delivered solid results in its fiscal 2024 third quarter. The company reported revenue of $61.9 billion, up 17% year over year. Its earnings jumped 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. AI continued to provide a major tailwind with server products and cloud services revenue increasing 24%.\n\nThe big loser of this group last week was Meta. Its stock plunged following the company's announcement of Q1 results on Wednesday. Meta's revenue rose 27% year over year to nearly $36.5 billion. Earnings skyrocketed 117% to almost $12.4 billion. Both numbers beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nSo what was the problem? During Meta's Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused primarily on initiatives that are losing money -- AI and the metaverse. The company also increased its full-year guidance for total expenses and capital expenditures, explaining that more spending would be needed for AI and metaverse development.\n\nThree winners\n\nI think Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta were all winners based on their impressive revenue and earnings growth in the latest quarter. More importantly, I expect all three stocks to be big winners for investors over the long term.\n\nSome worried that generative AI would be a \"Google killer.\" However, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the company's quarterly call that search usage is increasing among people who use Google's new AI overviews. He also stated, \"We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud as well as subscriptions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI continues to pay off in spades. The number of Microsoft Azure deals of $100 million or more jumped 80% year over year in the recent quarter, according to CEO Satya Nadella. The number of deals of $10 million-plus more than doubled. Microsoft's Copilot AI technology is boosting sales across the board.\n\nZuckerberg seemed to expect last week's sell-off of Meta shares. He said in the company's Q1 call, \"I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook -- where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\" However, he added, \"Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\"\n\nOne best pick right now\n\nSo which of these three AI stocks is the best pick right now? My vote goes to Meta.\n\nInvestors' negative reaction to Meta's quarterly update was way overdone, in my opinion. Zuckerberg was exactly right in his comments about the company's history of investing in new products that weren't monetized until later. I expect Meta will be successful in monetizing its AI and metaverse products too.\n\nMeta boasts the lowest valuation of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. I like (and own) Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, but now appears to be a great time to buy Meta on the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nasdaq Bull Market: Here's the Best Investing Move You Can Make Right Now",
        "content": "Concerns about higher inflation and a weakening economy pushed indexes into a bear market back in 2022, but last year, things began to look brighter. Many companies made efforts to cut costs and focus on their most profitable businesses, spurring a rebound in earnings. E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon is a perfect example of that, and the stock has climbed nearly 70% over the past year.\n\nAnd investors became more optimistic about the environment in general amid signs that interest rates could come down this year -- in a recent Reuters poll of 100 economists, half expect two rate cuts in 2024. Though rate cuts may come later than expected and may be fewer in number than economists originally predicted, a stabilization of rates or any reduction is a sign the economy is moving in the right direction. And that's positive news for companies and investors.\n\nAs a result of all of this, indexes climbed last year and extended gains this year, with the technology heavy Nasdaq recently soaring to a record and confirming the presence of a bull market. These are exciting times, but with many technology stocks racing higher, you may be wondering if it's still a good idea to invest -- or if it's better to wait for these movers and shakers to get cheaper. Let's talk about the best investing move you can make right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvesting in AI\n\nFirst, a quick note about the element -- beyond economic factors -- that's been driving the momentum, and that's artificial intelligence (AI). Technology companies have been investing heavily in this innovative area that promises to transform many industries and our daily lives. Some companies, like Nvidia and Intel, design chips to power something critical to the functioning of AI -- the training of AI models so that they then can answer complex problems.\n\nOther companies, like Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, sell AI platforms to customers. And still others, such as biotech Moderna, are using the technology to streamline their own operations and help them more quickly produce better products.\n\nThe AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2030, so it's logical that so many companies are doing what they can to eventually benefit. And it's also no surprise that investors, too, are hoping to benefit by piling into shares of eventual winners.\n\nSo right now, it's clear that technology shares, and particularly those involved in AI, are leading the Nasdaq and the general market higher.\n\nNow here's the best thing you can do: Keep investing, and invest for the long term. Don't get distracted by stocks that could pop on short-term news but don't have a compelling long-term story. Instead, focus on the strongest players -- within the AI field and beyond, as it's always a good idea to diversify -- and favor them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's first dividend\n\nFor example, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is making AI a priority, recently releasing its most powerful model ever -- Gemini -- that it's rolling out across its products and services to make them better than ever. At the same time, the tech giant this week wowed investors by announcing its first ever dividend and a massive stock buyback plan. At 23 times forward earnings estimates, the stock price is reasonable even after recent gains -- especially in the context of holding on for the long term.\n\nTo diversify beyond technology and AI, pharma giant Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) makes a top buy thanks to its broad portfolio of blockbuster drugs, including two prescribed for weight loss that could significantly increase revenue in the coming years. Lilly has climbed 88% over the past year, but thanks to its strong earnings growth track record and potential ahead, the stock still makes a great long-term buy.\n\nThose are just a couple of examples of rising stocks that still have room to run, but many others exist. And even in this bull market, you still will find quality stocks that haven't benefited, offering you the opportunity to pick them up at dirt cheap valuations.\n\nTime is on your side\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that time is on your side as an investor. If we look at the Nasdaq over time, as seen in the chart below, it has eventually declined after periods of gains -- but it's later gone on to win again. ^IXIC Chart\n\n^IXIC data by YCharts\n\nSo even if the market dips or falls at a certain point, it's likely to follow historical patterns and return to a bull phase. And this means that if you remain invested over time in quality companies or even in an index tracker, you're likely to score a win.\n\nToday, momentum is strong, and the feeling in the market is positive, but that doesn't necessarily mean that every stock is too expensive and that you should hold off on buying. Instead, continue investing according to your investment style -- cautious or aggressive.\n\nAnd, most importantly, choose companies you want to hold onto for a number of years. This way, you may benefit now during the bull market and over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, numerous next-big-thing investment trends have come and gone. But none of these trends have offered to change the growth arc for corporate America quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves using software and systems to undertake tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What makes AI special is the ability for software and systems to become smarter without human intervention over time (i.e., machine learning). Being able to evolve over time and become more proficient at their tasks gives AI-driven software and systems utility across almost every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to a report released last year by the analysts at PwC, productivity gains and consumption-side effects directly tied to AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. A figure this large is hard for investors -- and members of Congress -- to ignore.\n\nBased on data compiled by Unusual Whales in its \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report, members of Congress can't stop buying four artificial intelligence stocks. Interestingly, you won't find Nvidia on this list, despite it being a favorite of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband!\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first AI stock lawmakers have been avid buyers of is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, among other ventures.\n\nMembers of the House and Senate purchased an aggregate of $1.49 million worth of Alphabet Class A stock (GOOGL) last year. The biggest buyers included House. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who made numerous purchases in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, as well as House Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-NY), who added between $50,000 and $100,000 of Alphabet stock in late January 2023, based on trading activity compiled by Capitol Trades.\n\nWhat makes Alphabet such an attractive investment is its world-leading search engine. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search share. As the clear choice for advertisers, Google tends to enjoy strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates. Lengthy periods of economic growth are positive for ad-driven companies, as well.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest growth driver looks to be Google Cloud. Alphabet has been busy incorporating generative AI solutions into Google Cloud to help merchants tailor ads to consumers.\n\nLast year marked the first time Google Cloud generated a full-year operating profit. With enterprise cloud spending still early in its ramp, and cloud margins running circles around advertising margins, Alphabet should see a healthy uptick in its operating cash flow over time.\n\nStory continues Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband have been active buyers of Apple stock. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nApple\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that members of Congress have pounced on is tech titan Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). With the exception of oil and gas company ConocoPhillips, no stock was purchased more in 2023 by lawmakers than Apple ($2.4 million).\n\nThough Apple's future isn't as reliant on AI as the other companies on this list, voice assistant Siri is an example of it incorporating AI solutions into its iPhone for more than a decade.\n\nApple's biggest buyer in Congress last year was none other than S&P 500-outperformer Nancy Pelosi. A periodic transaction report from the former House Speaker noted a $500,000 to $1 million buy of Apple stock in March, which was followed by the purchase of $250,000 to $500,000 in additional shares in June.\n\nInnovation continues to be the driving force behind Apple's long-term outperformance. Its iPhone controls more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady evolution of Apple into a platforms company. Focusing on subscription services should lift the company's operating margin over time, as well as smooth out the revenue ebbs-and-flows that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since the start of 2013, the company's board has overseen $651 billion in buybacks.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third AI stock that congressional traders can't stop buying is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Unusual Whales' report finds that $1.06 million in Amazon shares were purchased by lawmakers last year.\n\nThe big buyers of Amazon stock have been the aforementioned Michael McCaul and House Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA). McCaul and Khanna are the two most-active traders in Congress, with 1,826 trades and 4,253 trades, respectively, completed last year.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its top-notch online marketplace, which accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. retail sales last year. However, operating margins associated with e-commerce are rather low. When it comes to cash flow generation and long-term growth potential, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's shining star.\n\nAWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 31% of global share, as of September 30, 2023, per Canalys. With enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, AWS shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate and generating the bulk of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon is also aggressively deploying generative AI solutions within AWS to allow its customers to build applications that can better serve their consumers.\n\nTesla\n\nA fourth AI stock that members of Congress can't stop buying is none other than North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Between the House and Senate, $840,000 in Tesla stock was purchased by lawmakers in 2023, according to Unusual Whales.\n\nThe congressional \"whale\" that was busy mashing the buy button on Tesla is Daniel Goldman. Though Goldman was active as both a seller and buyer -- behind Khanna and McCaul, he's the third most-active trader in Congress, with 1,306 trades in 2023 – his purchases of $100,000 to $250,000 of Tesla stock on March 6, 2023, as well as $15,000 to $50,000 on February 3, March 1, and April 10, stand out.\n\nThe lure for lawmakers with Tesla is its first-mover advantages in the EV space. Tesla has successfully built itself from the ground up to mass-production and delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla's EVs use cameras and sensors to assist with the split-second decision-making needed to navigate obstacles.\n\nBut among the four stocks congressional traders can't stop buying, Tesla is at the greatest risk of tumbling. Weakening demand for EVs has coerced Tesla to slash the price on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. The company has also dramatically reduced the price of its full-self driving software from what was once $15,000 to $8,000. Despite these substantial price reduction, Tesla's operating margin has nosedived from 17.2% to 5.5% over the last six quarters and its inventory levels have practically doubled.\n\nTesla's attempts to become more than a car company have fallen flat, too. Its Services segment offers a low-to-mid single-digit gross margin, while revenue growth for its once red-hot Energy Generation and Storage segment has slowed to the single digits. The once-vaunted growth story for Tesla looks to be officially dead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has had a profound impact on the investment landscape, due largely to his long-running success. His principles and perspectives have and will continue to shape the industry.\n\nBill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, is one such professional who follows the Oracle of Omaha's philosophies. He adopts a value-focused, concentrated investment strategy, identifying great businesses to own for the long haul.\n\nThe average investor might want to pay attention to this portfolio manager's moves, thanks to Ackman's impressive track record since Pershing Square's inception in 2004. In fact, there's one company that makes up nearly 19% of the $10 billion in assets.\n\nI'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Read on to learn what Bill Ackman appreciates about this business. Investors who are considering buying the stock can then view things with a fresh perspective.\n\nAlphabet is a fantastic business\n\nAlphabet has been in the Pershing Square portfolio for about a year, but that hasn't prevented it from becoming such a sizable holding. In his firm's June 2023 investor letter, Ackman described Google as \"one of the world's greatest businesses.\" I tend to agree with this statement.\n\nLet's start with Google Search, the company's crown jewel segment that commands 91% of the worldwide search market. Besides having a monopoly position, it has extremely high barriers to entry that make it virtually impossible for a newcomer to successfully launch a competing product. And given its tremendous scale, Search benefits from powerful network effects.\n\nYouTube is another Alphabet service that has network effects. The video streaming platform and search engine have made this business a digital advertising powerhouse.\n\nAckman is confident that spending will continue to shift from offline methods to digitally native avenues. And this provides a tailwind with which Alphabet can ride to growing revenue over time.\n\nThe transition from on-premises IT spending to off-premises has propelled Google Cloud into becoming the third-biggest cloud services provider in the industry. This segment posted 25% revenue growth in 2023, and it is now consistently profitable from an operating income perspective.\n\nWe can't ignore Alphabet's pristine finances. The billionaire hedge fund manager raved about the company's strong balance sheet, which carries $111 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $13 billion in debt. And by producing so much free cash flow, Alphabet can repurchase huge amounts of its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nFocused on artificial intelligence\n\nAckman added Alphabet to the Pershing Square portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. At that time, there were huge fears about the business falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) wars. With the benefit of hindsight, these worries were overblown. There might be no company better positioned than Alphabet to harness the power of this technology.\n\nSince as far back as 2001, Alphabet has been using AI and machine learning within Search. And AI is already a key tool within other popular products, like Maps, Gmail, and YouTube, with plans to introduce even more features to better serve users.\n\nThe management team has a huge advantage because the business possesses virtually unlimited financial resources, as well as elite tech talent and know-how, to be at the forefront of the AI revolution. In 2016, CEO Sundar Pichai pivoted Alphabet's strategy to be AI-first.\n\nWhat about Alphabet's valuation?\n\nAlphabet shares traded at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16 when Ackman first started purchasing the stock. That looked to be a smart use of capital. In the past year, shares have moved 49% higher (as of April 23).\n\nEven so, I think the valuation right now is compelling. At a forward P/E multiple of 23.2, Alphabet still looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $537,557!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 12 ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now.\n\nIn a world where inflation remains sticky, interest rates high and markets uncertain, why would anyone think of investing in individual stocks let alone riskier, volatile penny stocks? Isn't just investing your money in index funds a safer, better option? While the jury is still out when it comes to this question, data keeps showing that sensibly investing in individual stocks is still rewarding long-term investors with major gains. Bloomberg in a latest report mentioned several hedge funds and money managers who are crushing it by successfully beating the market with just a handful of stock picks. Oftentimes these are small-cap companies with strong growth catalysts. Some of these funds rode the AI wave by timely investing in large-cap tech stocks like Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHedge Funds Making Big Money Investing in Small Companies\n\nFor example, a small-cap fund run by Crimson Asset Management, based in Canada, has reportedly returned 10.2% annual since its inception in 2018. This was double the performance of the small cap-focused Russell 20000 index.  Crimson's website says that since its inception its small-cap fund has outperformed the Russell 2000 by+4.4% net of all fees and expenses on an annualized basis.\n\nAnother great example of funds beating the market by taking risks in the current environment is of billionaire Rajiv Jain, who founded GQG Partners, which has over $47 billion in managed securities as of the end of 2023. Jain's fund has managed to return 13% annually since its inception in 2016, double the gain of its benchmark, according to the Bloomberg report. When investors were exiting Adani Group shares following a scathing short report by Hindenburg Research last year, Jain was piling into the conglomerate's shares. When the Gautam Adani-led empire rebounded, Jain's bets paid off. The Bloomberg report cited Jain as saying:\n\n\"We are a business of taking risks. You have to be uncomfortable sometimes. If you look like an index all the time, guess what? You get indexlike returns.\"\n\nIt might be easy for Jain, worth over $4 billion, to say that you should keep taking risks. But can beginner investors also act as contrarian investors in the current market environment without breaking the bank? ChatGPT Penny Stock Picks Right Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We Have Not Lived by the Magnificent 7 and We Ought Not Die by Them\"\n\nAkre Focused Fund, run by Akre Capital Management of legendary value investor Chuck Akre, shared some interesting insights in its Q1 letter to investors, highlighting how it was able to beat the market without relying on the Magnificent Seven stocks. The fund's commentary said that while the Mag. 7 companies of today have strong fundamentals and the stock market today isn’t anything like the late-90s internet bubble, sooner or later their valuations would reach questionable levels.\n\n\"The problem is that financial excess is often built on kernels of truth: exotic tulips were rare in the Netherlands; the South Sea Company’s exclusive rights to international trade would prove lucrative; the Internet would, in fact, change the world; housing prices nationally only went up. However strong a foundation, financial markets can build valuations up past the point of structural soundness. And in today’s heavily “instructed” market environment, where momentum begets momentum regardless of value, this risk is not lessened. Will the Magnificent 7 defy market history and drive index performance over the next decade just as they did the preceding? Time will tell. In the meantime, we will stick to our knitting: concentrating capital in what we believe to be exceptional businesses, managed by great people, with extensive reinvestment opportunity and acumen. All the while making judgments about value. We have not lived by the Magnificent 7 and we ought not die by them. For us, that’s one less thing to worry about.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nThe market is always teeming with investing opportunities and smart investors are always finding them. While we keep telling our readers about what stocks are being picked up by smart investors, in this article we decided to turn to AI to ask its opinion on top penny stocks it believes have the potential to grow. We asked ChatGPT which penny stocks have the strongest upside potential. Here was our exact prompt:\n\n\"Act as a stock advisor and wealth manager and give me a list of the best penny stocks that have the biggest upside potential and strong growth prospects.\"\n\nThe chatbot, after several standard warnings and cautions, returned a list of penny stocks that \"have shown potential for growth.\"\n\n12. TRxADE HEALTH, Inc. (NASDAQ:MEDS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nTRxADE HEALTH, Inc. (NASDAQ:MEDS) provides IT solutions for the pharmacy industry. The stock has gained about 31% year to date through April 16. In March TRxADE HEALTH, Inc. (NASDAQ:MEDS) announced a special dividend of a whopping $8 per share.\n\n11. Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ:AEZS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nBiopharma company Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ:AEZS) ranks 11th in our list of the top ChatGPT penny stock picks. Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ:AEZS) is working on treatments for oncology and endocrinology-related diseases.  Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group owns an $18,000 stake in Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ:AEZS).\n\n10. Zomedica Corp. (NYSE:ZOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nZomedica Corp. (NYSE:ZOM) is one of the ChatGPT penny stock picks right now. The animal health company posted Q4 results earlier this month. Its revenue jumped 19% YoY in the quarter to $7.3 million.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, just one hedge fund tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stake in Zomedica Corp. (NYSE:ZOM).\n\n9. Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nChatGPT thinks Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM) has \"potential\" in the maritime transportation sector. Of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, just one hedge fund had stakes in Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM). In March, Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM) said its board approved a  1-for-10 reverse stock split of Castor Maritime Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CTRM) common shares.\n\n8. Kartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nKartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON), formerly known as Genius Brands International, Inc. (NASDAQ:GNUS), is a penny stock pick by ChatGPT since the AI chatbot believes Kartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON) has \"potential for growth\" in the streaming and content creation industry. Earlier this month Kartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON) posted revenue of $8.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nKartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON) said it decreased its costs in the fourth quarter by 70% on a YoY basis.\n\nJust one hedge fund reported owning stake in Kartoon Studios Inc (NYSE:TOON) as of the end of 2023.\n\nUnlike major companies like Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Kartoon is a risky stock.\n\n7. Ideanomics Inc (NASDAQ:IDEX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nChatGPT said EV company Ideanomics Inc (NASDAQ:IDEX) has shown potential in the past. However, the stock seems to be a bad pick since it has lost about 88% in value over the past one year. Lack of growth and challenges in the EV sector are crushing the stock.\n\nJust one hedge fund had stakes in Ideanomics Inc (NASDAQ:IDEX) as of the end of 2023.\n\nWhile hedge funds aren't much interested in penny stocks like IDEX, they are piling into quality names like Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n6.

        "title": "The AI trade is back, as confidence in Big Tech surges",
        "content": "The AI craze has returned to Wall Street — and investors are buying in.\n\nStandout quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) put the AI narrative back on track, sparking renewed confidence that big tech’s expensive bets on AI is boosting growth.\n\nAlphabet shares soared to an all-time high on Friday, closing above $2 trillion in market cap for the first time. Microsoft shares ended up 1.8%.\n\n“The AI investment story is intact,” BMO Wealth Management U.S. chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOutperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year.\n\n“They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.”\n\nResults from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago.\n\n“The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.”\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize.\n\nAnd the AI opportunity goes far beyond Microsoft and Google — the two companies often viewed by Wall Street as leaders in the AI race.\n\nRBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson told Yahoo Finance that Meta’s (META) selloff following earnings was an “overreaction,” and believes AI will be a “transformational driver\" for the company.\n\n“We’d be buying it,” Erickson said.\n\nThe rally in Mag 7 stocks comes ahead of key results from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) this week — two earnings reports that will be another critical test for the tech trade amid sky-high valuations.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Propel This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock 33% Higher, a Wall Street Analyst Says",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have been the driving force behind the current bull market. If there's one trend that's been pushing the stock prices of big tech companies higher, it's artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nPractically every member of the Magnificent Seven has a deep connection with the current push to advance AI:\n\nNvidia is the leading GPU chip designer, supplying growing data centers designed to train large language models. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are leading public cloud providers, providing access to foundational models for developers to create new AI-powered apps. All three have big investments in their own large language models and chip designs as well. Meta Platforms is developing a leading large language model, LLaMA, spending billions on data centers to train and implement its AI across its apps. Tesla is racing toward a robotaxi service powered by its massive investments in AI.\n\nJust one member of the seven has been exceptionally quiet about its AI: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker typically doesn't like to talk about what it's working on until it's ready for release. But that could change this summer.\n\nSeveral analysts believe Apple will make several big AI-related announcements this year. And one analyst expects AI-related products and services will push its stock price to $225, about 33% higher than the price as of this writing. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe summer of Apple AI\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan sees the recent pullback in Apple shares as a great buying opportunity ahead of the company's typical event schedule, which is set for this summer.\n\nHe sees Apple making a series of AI-related announcements at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June. During the company's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook promised investors that Apple will \"break new ground\" on generative AI this year. So the stage is set for Cook to unveil some big products and services.\n\nNobody knows what Apple could announce. While management has said it's spending a lot of time and money on generative AI, it hasn't provided much in the way of details.\n\nSeveral reports surfaced last month that Apple was in talks with Google to bring its Gemini AI to iPhones and other devices. Such a deal could be a big win for Alphabet, as its AI efforts have been dwarfed by competitors.\n\nBut putting someone else's AI chatbot on the iPhone is hardly \"breaking new ground.\" Investors should expect more.\n\nThat might have to wait until the end of summer, though, when Apple announces new iPhones. Mohan expects the 2024 iPhone model (presumably iPhone 16) will offer on-device generative AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat could be a big breakthrough for AI and data privacy, a major focus for Apple. Being able to run AI apps on a smartphone without sending data to a server for processing could open up the door for many more AI-powered applications and an AI App Store.\n\nApple is uniquely positioned to offer those capabilities on its hardware since it designs its own chips, some of the most advanced mobile processors available. What's more, they are specially designed to efficiently run Apple's software. That puts it in the driver's seat when it comes to introducing on-device AI to the mass market.\n\nShould you buy Apple before its next big announcement?\n\nThe stock has been one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2024. Shares are down more than 12%. Only Tesla's stock has performed worse, with every other member producing positive returns above the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the current pullback in price could be a great opportunity for investors. The stock currently trades for just 25.6 times forward earnings estimates. While that multiple is higher than the S&P 500, it's below most of the other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWhat's more, Apple's strong cash position and massive capital-return program give investors good reason to pay a premium for its shares. Mohan sees the company's capital return program as another potential catalyst for shares.\n\nEven if Apple doesn't provide investors with much to get excited about in AI, the stability of the iPhone and services business make it a great company to own. Adding new artificial intelligence capabilities, especially if they delivere innovation, could send the shares much higher. At its current price Apple stock appears to have more upside than downside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $537,557!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman Has 100% of His $11 Billion Portfolio in Just 8 Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is something of a legend in investing circles. He manages Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund he founded, which has nearly $11 billion in assets under management. The activist investor made his fortune by acquiring sizable positions in companies and pushing management to make positive changes that increase shareholder value.\n\nWhat sets Ackman apart from his hedge fund colleagues is that Pershing Square owns large stakes in just eight to 12 companies and generally holds them for years. It focuses on high-quality, large-cap, North American companies with limited downside and predictable, recurring cash flows. That strategy has been wildly successful for Ackman, as Pershing Square has generated a 31% annualized return over the past five years, roughly double the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nLet's look at the eight stocks that made up Pershing Square's portfolio to close out 2023 and why Ackman chose them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Chipotle: 22%\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is by far Pershing's largest holding, with roughly 825,000 shares worth more than $2.4 billion. Ackman first purchased Chipotle stock back in 2016 after the company experienced a spate of food safety issues which caused the stock to lose half its value.\n\nAckman cited Chipotle's \"continued focus on exceptional food and operational excellence\" for fueling the company's impressive growth. In 2023, revenue grew 14%, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) that climbed 38%. Ackman highlighted Chipotle's same-store sales that jumped 8% and margin expansion of 26% as fueling his confidence that Chipotle has a \"long runway for robust growth.\"\n\nOn a side note, Chipotle recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split, the first in the company's 30-year history.\n\n2. Hilton: 17%\n\nPershing holds a long-standing position in Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT), totaling 9 million shares worth nearly $1.9 billion. Ackman invested in the hotel operator in late 2018, significantly boosting his stake at the height of the pandemic, betting travel would eventually rebound. That bet has paid off big time.\n\nAckman called Hilton a \"high-quality business... led by an exceptional management team.\" In 2023 Hilton's revenue grew 17%, while adjusted EPS jumped 27%. Ackman cited the company's profit, noting it was 59% above pre-COVID levels, partially driven by average daily revenue per room that is 13% higher than in 2022. Ackman is also impressed by the company's market share increases.\n\n3. Restaurant Brands: 16%\n\nAstute investors will recognize the trend that's beginning to appear -- a continuing bet on the resilience of the consumer. Pershing Square holds more than 23 million shares of Restaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR), in a stake worth $1.7 billion. The company owns such iconic brands as Burger King, Popeyes, Firehouse Subs, and Tim Hortons. Ackman first invested in the restauranteur in 2012, before the company even went public, then increased his stake during the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAckman is excited by Restaurant Brands' \"long-term growth potential trading at a discounted valuation.\" Global sales climbed 12% in 2023, pushing EPS up 16%. He also likes the company's focus on the pure franchised royalty model, which offers \"decades\" of growth ahead.\n\n4. Alphabet (Class C shares): 14%\n\nOne of the key developments in 2023 was Ackman's investment in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG). Pershing holds 9.4 million Class C shares, with no voting rights, worth a $1.5 billion. Ackman cited \"misplaced concerns over the company's artificial intelligence (AI) positioning,\" resulting in an attractive valuation. That bet is already paying off.\n\nAlphabet's core advertising business improved consistently throughout 2023, as revenue grew 10% while EPS surged 27%. Ackman believes the strength of search and YouTube and the growth of Google Cloud will generate margin expansion, even as Alphabet invests heavily in AI.\n\nAlphabet's Class C shares have (modestly) outperformed Class A shares over the past five years, which may explain why Ackman owns more of the former. That said, he also owns Class A shares. (See No. 7.)\n\n5. Canadian Pacific Kansas City: 11%\n\nIn a page taken directly from Warren Buffett's (and Bill Gates') playbook, Ackman is betting on North American railroads. Pershing returned to one of his favorite investments in 2021 and holds 15 million shares of Canadian Pacific Kansas City(NYSE: CP), worth more than $1.2 billion. Ackman is attracted by the \"oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry.\"\n\nIn 2023, Canadian Pacific's revenue grew 42%, though EPS grew just 12%, hampered by labor disruptions and the weak economy. When Canadian Pacific completed its acquisition of Kansas City Southern last year, it created the only railroad with a direct route from Canada to Mexico. Ackman highlights the resulting revenue and cost synergies and its \"one-of-a-kind network\" and notes that rail is the cheapest, most viable way to transport heavy freight over long distances.\n\n6. Howard Hughes Holdings: 11%\n\nOf special note is Pershing's stake in Howard Hughes Holdings(NYSE: HHH), holding nearly 19 million shares worth $1.2 billion -- a 38% stake in the company. Ackman believes the property and land developer's ownership of master planned communities (MPCs) will \"drive resilient, long-term value creation.\" He points to the ongoing shortage of resale housing inventory which is driving strong demand for new homes.\n\nHoward Hughes Holdings delivered record MPC earnings before taxes and record operating asset net operating income. If that sounds confusing, that's because it's a complicated business designed to generate returns over years or even decades, so it won't be for everyone -- but Ackman is clearly sold.\n\n7. Alphabet (Class A shares): 6%\n\nPershing also holds 4.3 million Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Class A shares -- with voting rights -- worth $693 million. These are a merely a different class of shares for the same company, so the investing thesis here is the same. (See No. 4.)\n\n8. Lowe's: 3%\n\nUntil recently, Pershing Square held about 1.2 million shares of Lowe's(NYSE: LOW) in a stake valued at $286 million -- but no more. By the time the hedge fund's annual report came out in February, it revealed that Ackman had sold the remaining portion of his position. Pershing had maintained its stake in Lowe's since 2018, generating $1.8 billion in profit. The results were driven by the transformation of the business, thanks to robust same-store sales growth over five years and operating margin that expanded by 55%.\n\nAckman revealed that Pershing exited the investment, citing the macroeconomic environment, difficult industry conditions, and increased downside risk.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "One of the most closely followed investors on Wall Street is Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. While Ackman's portfolio has billions of dollars of investment capital, the hedge fund manager holds only seven individual stocks.\n\nAmong this small cohort is just one technology company: \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Earlier this month, Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer raised his price target on Alphabet stock to $185 -- implying roughly 17% to current trading levels as of market close on April 22.\n\nLet's dig into why Ackman and others on Wall Street have strong convictions on Alphabet and assess whether now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nAdvertising is the cash cow, but...\n\nAlphabet's core revenue and profit drivers come from advertising. Considering the company owns internet search website Google and video-sharing platform YouTube, it's safe to say that Alphabet has an enormous presence online.\n\nThe table below illustrates the growth trends in Alphabet's ad business over the last several years.\n\nCategory 2023 2022 2021 Google Search & other 8% 9% 43% YouTube ads 8% 1% 46% Google Network (4%) 3% 37% Total Google advertising 6% 7% 43%\n\nData source: Alphabet investor relations\n\nIn recent years, Alphabet has been forced to combat a number of competitors encroaching on its ad business. Meta Platformsowns a host of social media applications, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the rising popularity of TikTok has also taken a toll on Alphabet's appeal to advertisers.\n\nNevertheless, even in the face of decelerating growth in its biggest business, Alphabet remains highly profitable. It's this dynamic that I think investors are miscalculating.\n\nSure, the advertising segment is witnessing an existential crisis. However, Alphabet's robust operating margins are flowing down to the bottom line. And the company is making some savvy investments in new growth drivers that are already paying off. GOOGL Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\n...artificial intelligence (AI) is the new growth driver\n\nIn addition to advertising, Alphabet has a services business and a cloud computing operation. The Services segment includes subscriptions to YouTube TV and NFL Sunday Ticket, purchases from the company's app store, and sales from devices, such as the Google Pixel phone.\n\nInvestors should be keen to know that the Services business is highly profitable -- generating $95.6 billion of operating income in 2023, up 16% year over year. Moreover, the cloud division is now consistently profitable. Last year, Alphabet's cloud segment reported $1.7 billion in operating profit compared to a loss of $1.9 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the primary reasons Alphabet has been able to generate consistent, robust profitability metrics across so many different areas of its business is thanks to AI.\n\nIn his 2023 shareholder letter, Ackman outlined that Alphabet's \"competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\" This is a nice way of alluding to some investors seeing better opportunities than Alphabet regarding AI.\n\nHowever, the trends explored above undermine Ackman's position when it comes to Alphabet's business model. As the company continues to integrate AI throughout its ecosystem, investors should begin to see an exponential jump in the company's revenue and profit margin profiles across the many different areas in which Alphabet operates. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Alphabet?\n\nAs of the time of this article, Alphabet's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 is the second-lowest among the Magnificent Seven -- narrowly above Apple.\n\nMoreover, the company's price-to-free cash flow is essentially identical to Alphabet's 10-year average. Considering how much Alphabet has grown over the last decade and how different the company is today compared to 10 years ago, I think investors may be steeply discounting future growth opportunities. GOOGL Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nI think now is a lucrative chance to buy Alphabet on an underrated AI narrative. The stock looks dirt cheap relative to its peers, and with so much potential upside, it's hard to pass on this one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Results: Alphabet Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$81b, some 2.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$1.89, 25% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Alphabet from 44 analysts is for revenues of US$345.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply a decent 8.7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 13% to US$7.52. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$342.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.82 in 2024. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the decent improvement in earnings per share expectations following these results.\n\nThe consensus price target rose 9.8% to US$183, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Alphabet analyst has a price target of US$220 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$143. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Alphabet's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 17% over the past five years. Compare this to the 112 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.8% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Alphabet is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Alphabet following these results. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Alphabet analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nWe also provide an overview of the Alphabet Board and CEO remuneration and length of tenure at the company, and whether insiders have been buying the stock,  here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google asked a judge to toss the Justice Department’s lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing the technology used to buy and sell online advertising, arguing that the agency fabricated a market for the litigation but still failed to show that the tech giant controls at least 70% of it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBHP’s $39 Billion Copper Play Was Years in the Making Apple Intensifies Talks With OpenAI for iPhone Generative AI Features Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading The Long, Slow Death of Urban Nightlife Wall Street Humbled as Fast-Reversing Markets Confound the Pros\n\nGoogle alleged that antitrust enforcers “made up markets specifically for this case” of display advertising shown on the open web. That leaves out important competitors like Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and Instagram, Amazon.com Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, who all compete with the search giant to sell ads online or in their apps, the company said in a court filing Friday.\n\n“There can be no serious claim that ad placement on mobile apps and social media should be excluded in market share calculations,” Google said in its motion seeking summary judgment, which would end the case without the need for a trial.\n\nThe Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general sued Google last year for allegedly monopolizing the market for online advertising technology. That case followed a separate lawsuit filed in 2020 by Texas and other states alleging similar antitrust violations.\n\nAntitrust enforcers alleges that Google’s dominance over advertising technology allows it to keep at least $0.30 out of every dollar advertisers spend through its online advertising tools. The lawsuits allege Google has favored its own advertising tools by abusing access to information on rival bids for ad space, and also harmed other advertising exchanges by routing more bids for advertising to its own platforms.\n\nIn its filing, Google also said that even with the gerrymandered market definition, the company’s share didn’t meet the 70% threshold that courts in this part of the country have required for monopolization cases. The tech giant cited two previous cases it said found that a company needed to control at least 70% of the market to qualify as a monopoly. The Justice Department alleged in its complaint that Google controlled about 50% of the market for advertising exchanges, which are used to buy and sell online ads.\n\nThe case is US v Google, 23-108, US District Court, Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Divest-or-Ban Law Rattles TikTok Influencers Pushing Pro-Biden Content",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When President Joe Biden returned to the White House after delivering his State of the Union address, 23-year-old TikTok influencer Awa Sanneh joined roaring cheers alongside administration staffers gathered on the mansion’s back porch.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Apple Intensifies Talks With OpenAI for iPhone Generative AI Features Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Wall Street Humbled as Fast-Reversing Markets Confound the Pros The Long, Slow Death of Urban Nightlife\n\nBiden told the group “how important” social media content is to reach Gen-Z voters, recalled Sanneh, among dozens of creators invited for a watch party that night.\n\nJust weeks later, Biden signed into law a bill that forces TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., to sell its stake or face a ban in US app stores. That has rattled the social media creators his campaign has taken unprecedented steps to court.\n\n“I'm pretty critical of him at this moment in time,” said Sanneh, who has attended multiple administration briefings and has more than 510,000 followers. “If you truly understood the impact, then you would want to keep TikTok.”\n\nBiden’s embrace of the divest-or-ban bill exemplifies his efforts to contain what administration officials and lawmakers from both parties see as a growing national-security threat from China. Nonetheless, he continues to promote his political message on the platform.\n\nNone of the influencers who spoke to Bloomberg News said Biden had lost their vote. However, the new law is likely to turn off younger voters, who've propelled the app to mainstream relevance and are key to Democratic electoral wins. Many are already unenthusiastic about Biden’s reelection.“Election after election, young people continue to show us they understand the stakes of this moment, and will vote like their futures depend on it – because they do,” said Seth Schuster, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign.\n\nKenny Walden, who has 167,000 TikTok followers and has attended White House events, posted a video on the platform expressing confusion over Biden’s decision to back the bill over privacy and data security concerns.\n\n@2rawtooreal2\n\nMy thoughts havent changed on the tiktok ban\n\n♬ original sound - 2RawTooReal\n\n“I’m against it, Joe,” said Walden, whose content focuses on encouraging people to vote for Biden. The president is silencing his “frontline of defense,” he added, referring to creators like him.\n\nWhite House officials maintain their intention isn’t to prohibit TikTok from operating, but to force the app’s Chinese owner to divest. The 270-day deadline for ByteDance extends beyond November, allowing users to continue posting through the election.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This is about our national security. This is not concerns about Americans using Tiktok,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “There's certainly time on the books to see how this plays out.”\n\nEarlier: TikTok Ban in US Looms as Biden Kicks Off 270-Day Countdown\n\nByteDance has made clear it has no intention of selling, and a protracted legal battle is likely. At the same time, Donald Trump is already using the prospect of a ban to court younger voters. In a social media post before the bill passed Congress, he blamed Biden for setting a ban in motion. That marked a reversal for Trump, who as president signed an order in 2020 banning the app that was later overturned in court.\n\nBiden’s team says its presence on the app is a vital part of a strategy to reach voters in as many arenas as possible. The app’s reach is massive: More than 170 million Americans have accounts, the company says, and a third of adults under 30 get their news from it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nEarlier: Biden’s Campaign to Stay on TikTok Despite Divestment Law\n\nIn a first-of-its-kind push for a presidential administration, Biden's aides are in touch daily with social media influencers or their managers. Meanwhile, campaign officials are considering bringing creators into their headquarters, said a person familiar with the deliberations.\n\nThe campaign’s partnerships with popular creators are all the more important since TikTok prohibits political advertising. Organizing multiple people to push positive content beats Biden’s presence alone on the app, according to a person with knowledge of the strategy.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a TikTok account during the Super Bowl in February. It has more than 300,000 followers, which pales in comparison to those of the most popular influencers. The campaign is taking at least one known security precaution: Staffers post on the app from one separate device.\n\nBiden officials were already facing a daunting landscape on TikTok, even before he signed the divest-or-ban bill. Negative posts about the 81-year-old president proliferate on the platform, driven by frustration over his handling of the war in Gaza, his age and climate policies.\n\n“It’s very anti-Biden,” Kerry Robertson, a Minneapolis-based influencer who supports Biden, said of TikTok. “It always has been.”\n\n“Even though the algorithm isn't showing me any kind of pro-Biden content or anything like that, whenever I do those videos, I get a lot of ‘Thank you for this,'\" she added.\n\nEarlier: Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls\n\nThere is no clear evidence TikTok’s algorithm has a particular political bent, according to Neta Kligler-Vilenchik, a Hebrew University of Jerusalem assistant communication professor. But since it’s notoriously opaque, it presents a “problem” for those seeking to understand its growing political influence, said Columbia University associate communications professor Ioana Literat.\n\n“Look what's happening on TikTok,” Biden said recently at a fundraiser. “It’s so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what’s true, so we got a lot at stake here.”\n\nIt’s difficult to measure the volume of positive or negative sentiment about Biden on TikTok because the company restricts certain data. Users are often siloed in different content universes, where their feeds reflect topics they interact with the most, experts say.\n\nBiden’s team is making the calculus that they can persuade disenchanted voters to consider supporting him, in part through online content.\n\nBefore Biden’s Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March, which featured comedian Stephen Colbert and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, some TikTok creators joined a roundtable with campaign staffers about digital strategy, where Biden stopped by to speak with them, one influencer recapped in a video.\n\n@claaaarke\n\nseeing biden, obama, clinton + queen latifah in one day? high school clarke is screaming ????\n\n♬ Calm (Lofi) - Faneo sound\n\nFinnegan Biden, Biden's granddaughter, also hosted a happy hour for creators at nearby Pebble Bar before the fundraiser.\n\nSimilar to the Radio City event, behind-the-scenes visits to the White House are great fodder for social media. \"Look at this — this napkin has the seal of the president on it,\" Sanneh said in a video inside a White House bathroom that drew 2.1 million views.\n\n@_awasanneh\n\nDear Awa-Topia (the name is a work in progress- shush): your unwavering support has been the heartbeat of my journey. Your passion fuels my creativity, and your dedication lights up my darkest days. Thank you for being the foundation of this incredible life I get to live. Thank you for supporting this slightly off- putting, wierd, black girl from Texas. Gratitude flows from every corner of my heart to yours.\n\n♬ original sound - Awa\n\nIf TikTok goes away, so does a source of influencers’ revenue. Harry Sisson, a 21-year-old who has joined both official and campaign gatherings, is encouraging his 850,000 TikTok followers to watch videos on his YouTube channel, where he has been posting more because of the potential ban.\n\n“There are a lot of creators on TikTok who support them and have done a lot of work for the campaign and the president,” Sisson said in an interview. “I’m overall disappointed.”\n\n--With assistance from Alex Barinka.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla and Microsoft presented 2 distinct versions of AI. Investors liked both.",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nInvestors were treated to two different versions of artificial intelligence this week. And both sound pretty good.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) announced a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) in which the soft drink king would pay $1.1 billion to “jointly experiment” with Microsoft’s new Azure AI-based version of its cloud-based suite of productivity software.\n\nAnd when Microsoft’s quarterly results showed AI driving more and more of its cloud business growth and bullish guidance from an enthusiastic leadership team, the stock rose 2% Friday.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) had a similar story, but with a stronger investor reaction — up 10% Friday — as investors reconsidered the company’s second-place position to Microsoft. Now, it seems YouTube, search, and cloud businesses are strapped in and ready for their AI-ification.\n\nOn the other side of the table was Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings presentation. The company doubled down on its endgame of fully autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi fleet, licensing self-driving tech to other automakers — they’re in conversations, Elon Musk said — and the potential of harnessing the AI computing power of parked Teslas to create something akin to Amazon’s AWS, a bold but old idea that has been floating around since the 1980s.\n\nThese are two very different visions of an AI future. “Productivity software” certainly doesn’t have the same ring as “robotaxi,” which is on the fun end of Peter Thiel’s “we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” spectrum we discussed two weeks ago.\n\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, investors liked both of them.\n\nAnd they should. Tesla’s surge was partially about rebutting some reasonable investor fears — cutting costs to tackle lagging demand and reaffirming that cheaper EVs are on the way. But the bigger story was the self-driving AI vision from the grand visionary.\n\nThis is rare, and it’s why some people love Elon. For the most part, the path of AI first runs through the tedious corporate world of programmatic advertising and productivity tools, the core businesses of today’s big AI software/cloud players — Google, Microsoft, and Meta.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla’s splashy self-driving future of consumer cars and robotaxis is far more aligned with the “change the world” Big Tech expectation (aspiration, really) than the “better Office 365” reality we so often see.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut these more mundane improvements are everything. It’s important to remember the lessons that any regional American city will teach you: Tons of America’s rich simply took the practical route, embracing the less glamorous business of fast-food franchising, agricultural processing, waste management, car dealerships, commercial properties, not to mention all the other B2B things you’d never think twice about. For every Zuckerberg, there are thousands of Buddy Garritys.\n\nZuckerberg, however, may have taken the mundane too far Wednesday in Meta’s earnings call by, as our Hamza Shaban put it, making AI aspirations “seem small.” The company talked about “scaling business messaging,” “better ad insertion,” and selling AI computing power.\n\nAnd as we wrote in March, breaking productivity barriers is huge for the economy. But you still have to sell them. After all, they're still \"productivity gains,\" not flying cars.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Owns 8 Stocks -- and This Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Isn't One of Them",
        "content": "Bill Ackman and his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital(OTC: PSHZ.F), are notable investors. Thanks to his frequent appearances on popular financial news networks and his coverage in other publications, the billionaire is a well-recognized investor. But some may be surprised to hear that his hedge fund only owns eight stocks -- and only seven companies.\n\nPershing Square Capital's current holdings look like this.\n\nCompany Percentage of Portfolio Chipotle Mexican Grill  18.3% Restaurant Brands International 17.6% Hilton Hotels 16.2% Howard Hughes Holding 15.1% Alphabet (class C shares) 12.8% Canadian Pacific Kansas City 11.5% Alphabet (class A shares) 5.9% Lowe's 2.7%\n\nData source: Whale Wisdom. Note: Percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding.\n\nSome investors might cringe at his portfolio's lack of diversification, but Ackman's strategy has worked out over the long term. Additionally, some might question its lack of artificial intelligence (AI) exposure, especially since he doesn't own Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe only real AI exposure in his portfolio is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which is still mainly an advertising firm right now.\n\nSo, why don't Ackman and Pershing Square Capital own Nvidia?\n\nNvidia doesn't fit with Ackman's No. 1 rule\n\nAny assessment of Ackman's style will clearly show he's a value investor, following the footsteps of perhaps the most famous investor of all time: Warren Buffett. His top qualification for determining whether he should buy a stock is if the business is \"simple and predictable.\"\n\nAny investor following Ackman's No. 1 rule would therefore refrain from buying most AI-related stocks, including Nvidia. However, Nvidia is fairly simple at its core. Its primary products, graphics processing units (GPUs), are computation hardware that can perform large volumes of calculations in parallel. This makes GPUs extremely well suited to handle computationally arduous tasks like displaying the complex and rapidly changing graphics of modern video games -- and training and running the latest generative AI models. At the end of the day, Nvidia's business model is simple: Sell more GPUs.\n\nUnfortunately for investors, the company's sales arc is far from predictable. Before the generative AI arms race that triggered Nvidia's latest sales boom, Nvidia was reeling from the crash of the cryptocurrency market. Its GPUs can also be used to mine Bitcoin and a few dozen other proof-of-work coins, so when the crypto winter hit in 2021, that source of demand dried up.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipmaking is a cyclical business, and demand for Nvidia's products will fall from time to time. This will include the demand for the types of GPUs that are currently being used to power AI models. Eventually, enough infrastructure will have been built that Nvidia won't need to produce quite as many GPUs. But when this will happen is anyone's guess, which makes the business unpredictable.\n\nHowever, that's about the only rule of Ackman's that Nvidia breaks.\n\nAckman's other preferences\n\nOn his checklist for potential investments, Ackman lists other factors. Among them, he likes companies that are dominant in their space, operate in businesses with high barriers to entry, produce high capital returns, and have excellent management. Those are all characteristics Nvidia displays, so why doesn't Ackman own its shares?\n\nBecause Ackman doesn't break his No. 1 rule. While an investor may at times bend a few of their other investing rules, one should never stray from the core principle of their portfolio. Ackman understands his investing style and he has done well with it, so for him, venturing into growth investing wouldn't be wise.\n\nIn sum, the reason why Ackman and Pershing Square do not own Nvidia is because it doesn't fit their style.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Who? 3 AI Plays Destined to Outshine the Industry Giant",
        "content": "Investors have been snookered by technology head fakes in the past. The metaverse was hardly the game-changing advance we were promised. Very few people, it turns out, actually want to be connected to their computers all day, every day to work, play and interact. The metaverse may hold some value but the exponential market opportunity analysts predicted seems way off the mark.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is different. Today, businesses are realizing tangible real-world benefits of utilizing AI. Speed bumps will emerge along the way, of course. Energy consumption is going to strain just how far the technology can go. Water for cooling systems will divert an already scarce resource from other equally vital needs. But unlike the metaverse, AI is the real deal.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the early stages of AI’s breakout. Its advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) chips were readily able to handle the complex and all-consuming nature of AI’s demands. But with more competition developing equally powerful chips, Nvidia stock may not be the winning play it once was.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three companies are AI stocks to outshine Nvidia in the next stage of the technology’s evolution and growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough best known as a smartphone chipmaker, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) flies under the radar of many investors as an AI stock. They might be surprised to learn Broadcom is actually the second-largest AI chipmaker by revenue behind Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker generated $4 billion in annual AI revenue last year but reported $2.3 billion in the first quarter, quadruple the year-ago figure. It estimates 35% of fiscal 2024 revenue will come from AI, or some $10 billion. Previously the chipmaker forecast a quarter of its revenue, or $8 billion, would be from AI but growth is accelerating.\n\nThe reason for the increase is data center demand from hyperscalers. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators are behind the designs of the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). Also, it designed a custom chip for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At its investor day in March, Broadcom announced it signed on a third large cloud customer for its AI accelerators.\n\nLook for the chipmaker to readily surpass Nvidia in the near future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another surprising AI chipmaker that is on a path to outshine Nvidia. The chipmaker is looking for AI revenue to double this year and then keep doubling for several years thereafter. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a customer, and earlier this month announced it won another large customer for its AI chips. The one downside for Marvell Technology is that its custom chips carry lower gross margins than its off-the-shelf chip business.\n\nYet, custom chips will be a significant driver of future revenue growth. And Marvell Technology is looking to make up in volume what it loses in margins. For that reason, the chipmaker maintained its gross margin forecast when it reported earnings recently. Marvell says adjusted gross margins will be between 62% and 63% in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nWhere the chipmaker is expected to excel is in the electro-optical chips that sell into data centers and AI networks. With both channels anticipated to see significant expansion in the coming years, Marvell Technology will experience rapid growth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock that should outshine Nvidia in the future is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As the world’s largest chip foundry pureplay, just about every chipmaker turns to TSM to make its chips – Nvidia included.\n\nWhen the chipmaker reported earnings the other day, it shook the market by implying a slowdown coming in the semiconductor market. However, it forecast its own business to keep growing with guidance of “low- to mid-20%” revenue growth. AI was the primary reason for it.\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei said the contract manufacturer was still experiencing a “surge in AI-related demand.” He termed it “insatiable.” It is yet another semiconductor stock expecting AI to cause revenue to “more than double this year.” TSM forecasts AI will represent a “low-teens” percentage of full-year sales.\n\nWith Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as top customers, so long as their respective AI business grows, you can be sure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will outshine them all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "When it comes to finding tech stocks, investors tend to gravitate to the top stocks in the industry. These companies tend to combine faster-than-average growth rates with solid balance sheets, making them a frequent choice.\n\nHowever, timing can temporarily reduce the popularity of such choices. Although investors may like Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance, they may stay away due to a high valuation. Conversely, Intel's decline and periodic setbacks may leave investors questioning whether one should consider it a \"top\" tech stock.\n\nStill, other top tech stocks may look more like buys now. Investors may want to consider Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB).\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has met with unexpected struggles in recent months. A release of an upgraded version of OpenAI's ChatGPT appeared to catch the company off guard. And given OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, many wondered whether Google's search and cloud platforms could stay competitive.\n\nNonetheless, it is likely too early to count the Google parent out. It has utilized AI for more than 20 years and became an \"AI-first\" company in 2016, so it remains a player in that industry.\n\nAlso, it has responded with its own generative AI product called Gemini. While it has not escaped controversy, Alphabet has shown it is not going to surrender to its competitors.\n\nMoreover, it holds about $111 billion in liquidity, a cash hoard matched by few companies. Thus, if its researchers cannot invent competing in-house products, it can likely buy the technology it needs.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet has sustained revenue growth amid struggles, as its $307 billion in revenue for 2023 rose 9% yearly. Also, its net income for that year of $74 billion is above 2022 levels and has nearly caught up to the 2021 earnings of $76 billion, when many of its customers were in lockdown.\n\nFinally, despite doubts, the stock has generally increased, and the 27 P/E ratio is right at its five-year average. Such conditions make now an excellent time to add shares steadily.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nAmid falling sales of its 5G chips in recent months, Qualcomm seems to have fallen out of favor. A sluggish economy reduced sales in past quarters, and with increasing investments in its Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automotive segments, it faces uncertainty as it prepares for the day when smartphone usage may fall.\n\nHowever, the company has not let the rise of AI pass it by. Its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip is AI-enabled, likely bringing more AI capabilities to smartphones. Moreover, it applies AI technology to signal reception, improving overall communication quality. This should lead to a significantly improved performance for its smartphone chipsets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most recent financial results indicate the comeback may have already begun. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 24, 2023), revenue of $9.9 billion rose 5% from year-ago levels and improved from the 19% revenue decline in fiscal 2023.\n\nAlso, net income in fiscal Q1 was $2.7 billion, a 24% yearly increase. That should go a long way in turning profitability around, after it fell 44% in fiscal 2023.\n\nOver the last six months especially, investors have steadily turned more bullish on Qualcomm, and the stock gained 33% over the previous year as a result.\n\nAlso, even though its valuation has climbed, its 23 P/E ratio compares well to other AI chip designers. Those factors should bode well for Qualcomm as it continues leading the smartphone chipset market.\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb has stood out for applying technology to transform the short-term rental industry. The company's platform has allowed it to turn any room or residential unit into a potential vacation property. Its increased recognition attracts prospective landlords and tenants alike, creating a virtuous cycle that leads to more nights and experiences getting booked on its platform.\n\nAdditionally, AI has played a critical role in its success. That technology helped with challenges such as pricing a property in a specific market, vetting prospective tenants, and preventing disruptive parties from taking place.\n\nOverall, it has become an ecosystem that steadily grows its reach and revenue. In 2023, revenue was $9.9 billion, 18% more than the previous year.\n\nAdmittedly, general and administrative expenses more than doubled due to a spike in operational and business taxes, causing expenses to rise by 29%. However, a $2.7 billion income tax benefit and a spike in interest income allowed it to earn $4.8 billion, a 153% yearly gain.\n\nInvestors have largely overlooked the higher operating costs, and Airbnb stock rose nearly 30% over the last year.\n\nAlso, while the income tax benefit led to an artificially low P/E ratio of 22, the forward P/E of about 35 indicates the market has reasonably priced the stock. That should bode well for investors as Airbnb transforms the short-term rental industry through technology.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Billionaires Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander Are Buying",
        "content": "Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander are some of the most successful investors in history.\n\nAll three are billionaires, and their respective hedge funds -- Renaissance Technologies, Bridgewater Associates, and Millennium Management -- have made thousands of investors rich along with them.\n\nIn investing, there are no bonus points for originality, so it pays to study the masters. In fact, thanks to the 13F filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter, you can invest alongside these billionaires as well.\n\nAccording to Motley Fool Research, these investors all own three of the same \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. Keep reading to see what they are and if these stocks are right for you. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's probably not a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) on this list. More than any other company, Nvidia has been the flag bearer of the AI boom as its sales and profits skyrocketed over the last year, propelling the stock past a $2 trillion market cap, and making it the third-most valuable company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, and the company has faced little competition thus far, though competition is coming.\n\nSimons, Dalio, and Englander all count Nvidia among their top holdings. At Renaissance Technologies, Nvidia is the second-largest tech holding, making up 1.2% of the portfolio, or $767.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nDalio's Bridgewater Associates, meanwhile, counts Nvidia as its third-largest tech holding with $133 million in Nvidia stock at the end of Q4. The fast-growing chip stock made up 0.7% of Bridgewater's portfolio.\n\nFinally, Nvidia makes up the fourth-largest tech holding in Englander's Millennium Management at 1% of the portfolio, or $1.02 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if these funds held, added to, or sold Nvidia in Q1, but we'll learn soon as 13F filings are due by mid-May. If they hold on to their Nvidia stakes, that move paid off as the stock jumped 82% in Q1.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is another top holding of these hedge funds, and like Nvidia, it's soared over the last year and a half. While Meta has benefited from the AI boom, the primary reason for its surge is a successful turnaround driven by cost cutting and a resurgence in its ad business that led to record profits.\n\nLooking ahead, the company still seems to have plenty of growth in front of it, especially with the new opportunity in AI, though some advertisers have recently complained that the company's ad manager has been unreliable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Renaissance, Meta represents the fund's fourth-largest holding in the tech sector with $744 million worth of Meta stock. Meta makes up 1.2% of the fund's value.\n\nRay Dalio's Bridgewater, meanwhile, is even more bullish on Meta as the social media giant makes up 1.3% of its portfolio as its second-biggest tech holding. The fund finished Q4 with $235.8 million worth of Meta stock.\n\nLastly, Millennium held $719.7 million in Meta stock as of the end of Q4, or 0.7% of the portfolio. That made it its fifth-largest tech holding.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nFinally, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has long been a top stock among hedge funds as the Google parent's competitive advantages are manifest with its dominant search engine, properties like YouTube, and promising \"moonshot\" businesses like its Waymo autonomous vehicle unit, and its AI investments like Google Brain and DeepMind.\n\nAlphabet hasn't had the kind of blowout performance over the past year that Nvidia and Meta have, but it's still outperformed the S&P 500 and recently touched an all-time high. Given its history of reliable growth and wide economic moat, it's not surprising that Alphabet is also a top pick among these three funds.\n\nAt Renaissance, Alphabet was its sixth-largest tech holding, worth $487.2 million, or 0.8% of the total portfolio.\n\nBridgewater was more bullish on Alphabet than any other tech stock, counting it as its top-tech holding at 1.6% of the total portfolio. As of the end of Q4, Bridgewater owned $285.6 million worth of Alphabet stock.\n\nMillennium also counts Alphabet as a top holding as the Google owner's stock makes up 1.8%, or $1.56 billion. Only Microsoft is a larger tech holding at Englander's fund.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nHedge fund ownership isn't a guarantee of outperformance, but it's worth tracking the moves of the biggest investors, especially if their holdings are similar to yours.\n\nKeep your eye on these stocks come mid-May as they could move once we learn which funds bought and sold them in Q1.

        "title": "Does Mag 7 Leadership Remain Intact Post-Tesla and Meta Disappointments?",
        "content": "We have Apple and Amazon on deck to report Q1 results this week, and we will need to wait a few more weeks before we see Nvidia’s numbers. But we have already seen Q1 results from the other four members of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group: Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, and Tesla TSLA.\n\nIt is hard to find any weakness in the Microsoft and Alphabet reports, and the market’s reaction to these two reports shows that investors agree with that assessment. The Alphabet report appears to reassure investors that it has a credible AI strategy in place and may not be that far behind Microsoft in this critical race.\n\nThe market reaction to the Tesla and Meta reports needs to be contextualized.\n\nMeta shares were very strong performers prior to this report, and any way you look at the company’s Q1 results, they are impressive. Meta’s Q1 earnings were up +80.5% from the year-earlier period on +27.3% higher revenues. Investors’ beef with the Meta report is the company’s guidance for capital expenditures, which is going up significantly to strengthen the company’s AI capabilities.\n\nI think the reaction is overdone, but it likely reminds investors of the pain created by the company’s earlier metaverse plans. Perhaps there is a basis for those worries, given the metaverse history. But as we are seeing with Microsoft and Alphabet, leadership in AI requires a lot of spending. If market participants are okay with Microsoft and Alphabet spending hands-over-fist on AI, then they should also be okay with Meta.\n\nTesla shares have been the worst performing of the group, with many starting to speak out that perhaps it didn’t deserve to be part of this group. The stock price weakness reflects the steadily deteriorating earnings outlook, with a combination of softening demand and heightened competitive pressures forcing Elon Musk to cut prices. You can see this in the chart below, which plots the stock price relative to how EPS estimates for this year and next have evolved. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven this stock’s price action and estimates revision trajectory coming into the quarterly release, investors were conditioned to expect the worst from Tesla, but the actual results were simply bad (instead of ‘very bad’). They missed on the top- and bottom lines and didn’t provide any favorable or reassuring commentary about the outlook. But investors were relieved that the numbers weren’t as ugly as they had started fearing.\n\nTesla shares are still laggards relative to other Mag 7 stocks, as the year-to-date performance chart shows.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUsing estimates for Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, which will release their March-quarter results on April 30th, May 2nd, and May 22nd, respectively, and actual results for the other four members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +43.7% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth performance in the context of what we saw from the group in the preceding quarter and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.1% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 20.6% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 21.6% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings contribution to the index over time and what is currently expected for the next two years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven the group's enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with its market leadership.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +27.1% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 950 companies reporting results, including 177 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Apple and Amazon reports, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\n\nThrough Friday, April 26th, we have seen Q1 results from 229 S&P 500 index members, or 45.8% of the index’s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 229 index members are up +2.8% from the same period last year on +3.3% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 59.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.

        "title": "YouTube was the real hero of Google’s Q1 earnings, and it should set off alarm bells at Netflix",
        "content": "Google’s advances in the AI market drew widespread cheers following its first quarter earnings report on Thursday, but the company’s results also showed that it’s making strides in another competitive sector: video streaming.\n\nGoogle’s subscriptions grew 18% in the first three months of the year driven by YouTube, while YouTube’s ads business grew 21%. And company executives ticked off a string of other metrics and milestones intended to show the progress being made in streaming.\n\nYouTube subscriber bases are hitting critical mass with TV, its cable-plus television streaming service, now at 8 million users, and Music and Premium boasting over 100 million (including trial users). This will help the video giant generate $3.12 billion in revenue from YouTube subscriptions this year (versus $2.87 billion in 2023), predicts EMarketer.\n\n“More and more people are watching YouTube from the living room,” said Chris Ballard, managing director at Check Capital Management.\n\nDriving much of that growth was demand to watch NFL games via the company’s ultra-pricy Sunday Ticket offering, as well as its cable alternative YouTube TV and the ad-free Premium version of YouTube. YouTube TV subscribers get over 100 TV channels and access to cable staples like on-demand offerings. And starting at $13.99 per month, YouTube Premium subscribers unlock the ad-free version of YouTube, including its Spotify-alternative YouTube Music.\n\nThese subscription offerings are a nice addition to Google’s ad-supported business, helping to diversify Google’s revenue stream while also bolstering its position as one of the top players in the streaming market.\n\nAnd while many of the other big streaming companies like Netflix and Disney are trying to build ad-based businesses, YouTube is working in “reverse,” said Emarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. “Streaming services are finding that getting paid by both consumers and advertisers will make them less beholden to the whims of either,” he told Fortune in an emailed statement.\n\nNetflix has made nice inroads so far with its new ad tier. The company said last week that the ad business increased 65% quarter-over-quarter in Q1, helping boost the company's overall revenue to $9.37, above analyst estimates. In the long run, a Netflix executive said during the company's earnings call, it hopes that the advertising and subscription businesses will be roughly equivalent in size, though they noted that Netflix currently has more available inventory than it has been able to monetize through ad sales.\n\nThe increasing competition for streaming ad dollars is causing Wall Street to sweat. After Rokualluded to this challenge in its earnings report, the company’s stock dropped more than 10% on Friday — despite strong quarterly results.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Google and YouTube, of course, advertising is the foundation of the business, powered by a deep reservoir of specialized technology. YouTube’s advertising business grew 21% in the first quarter of this year, showing that the video giant's central moneymaker isn’t going anywhere as it continues to return on marketers’ investments. And Emarketer’s Benes believes that YouTube increasing its TV user base will enable it to attract advertising dollars from TV-centric marketers.\n\n“Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place, across screens and formats — their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music and more,” said Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler during the earnings call.\n\nYouTube’s subscription revenue in the first quarter actually declined slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said this was because YouTube only had one week of Sunday Ticket revenue—the end of the NFL season—in the first quarter of 2024 versus 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAt $449 per NFL season, Sunday Ticket is YouTube’s highest priced subscription product (though it's often available cheaper with special promotions), and at least one Wall Street analyst on Thursday's earnings call was eager for YouTube to launch more sports partnership subscription products. While the company shared no plans to do so on the call, with $108 billion in cash on its balance sheet, it certainly has the means to score more touchdowns if it decides to double down on sports.\n\nThursday’s earnings announcement also arrived close to the one-year anniversary of YouTube TV’s price increase from $64.99 per month to $72.99 per month. Now that consumers have acclimated to this price, YouTube will eventually become the largest TV and cable provider globally, says Emarketer’s Benes. And ultimately, he believes, this will tip the scale in favor of YouTube in striking and renewing partnership deals with TV networks.\n\nCould streaming subscription revenue ever top advertising revenue, and become the main-event at YouTube?\n\nUnlikely, says Check Capital Management’s Ballard.\n\n“In our view, YouTube’s ad business is destined to be much larger than the subscription business,” Ballard said, via email. “People have shown a demonstrated preference for free ad-supported services over paid subscriptions. Look no further than total YouTube users versus Netflix users. It’s not even close. YouTube has 2.7 billion global users and Netflix has 270 million.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Time to Buy the Surge in Alphabet's (GOOGL) Stock After Earnings?",
        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL made headlines in Friday’s trading session after crushing its first quarter earnings expectations yesterday evening and helping the broader indexes cap off a strong rebound.\n\nSurging more than +10% today, Alphabet shares were boosted by news that the tech giant will be paying its first-ever dividend along with its board of directors approving $70 billion in stock buybacks.\n\nLet’s review Alphabet’s captivating Q1 report and see if now is a good time to buy into the strong post-earnings rally with GOOGL up more than +20% year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review\n\nAlphabet’s Q1 earnings increased 61% to $1.89 per share compared to EPS of $1.17 in the comparative quarter. This topped the Zacks Consensus of $1.49 a share by 27%. On the top line, Q1 sales of $67.59 billion expanded 16% from $58.06 billion a year ago and came in 2% above estimates. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe strong results were attributed to Google Search, Cloud, and stronger advertising growth on YouTube. Alphabet also emphasized that it is well-positioned for the next wave of artificial intelligence through its platform Gemini which is a generative AI multimodal with understanding across audio, video, and text code.\n\nNotably, Google Cloud revenue beat estimates by 3% and grew 28% year over year to $9.57 billion with Alphabet still thought to hold the third spot in the domestic cloud computing market behind Amazon’s AMZN AWS and Microsoft’s MSFT Azure. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMarket Cap & Dividend\n\nAlphabet’s quarterly dividend will be $0.20 per share with the first payout set for June 17 to shareholders on record as of June 10. With the dividend and stock buyback announcement fueling today’s rally, Alphabet’s stock briefly hit a $2 trillion market cap for the first time since 2021 with only Apple AAPL and Microsoft having a larger capitalization. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlphabet’s Q1 report helped reconfirm expectations of double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2024 and for now, GOOGL lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With inflation up, economic growth down and two-year Treasury yields testing 5%, Bill Gross sensed the music in markets was fading, and said it was time to get over the likes of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Fed’s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip Billionaire Stephen Ross Believes in South Florida—and Is Spending Big to Transform It\n\n“Stick to value stocks,” the Pacific Investment Management co-founder posted Thursday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Avoid tech for now.”\n\nJust a day later, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index notched its best session since February after Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. showed the AI earnings bonanza still has juice.\n\nIt’s the latest gut-check for anyone trying to get a handle on the short-term moves of markets, just as new questions emerge about the viability of an economic soft landing. An ETF riding the momentum trade shot up 3.5% this week, after plunging 5.6% in the previous week.\n\nMacro signals continue to confound. Growth eased more than expected, a report showed Thursday, yet indicators of consumption and investment remain constructive. A day later strong personal-spending data was duly cheered by economic bulls, while raising the eyebrows of inflation hawks.\n\nUndeterred, money managers just pushed the S&P 500 more than 2.5% higher on the week as they continue to pay through the nose for companies that promise to post profits in the years ahead.\n\n“Tech/growth used to be affected by higher yields,” Gross wrote in an email to Bloomberg on Friday. “But not for now.”\n\nWith swings in stocks and Treasuries elevated, money managers sharing the bond king’s caution have been rushing to hedge richly priced equities via exchange-traded funds. Meta Platforms Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., for example, lost $150 billion in market value combined on Thursday alone.\n\nYet even as traders price out the Federal Reserve’s mid-year monetary pivot — pressuring yields higher — risky assets remain remarkably stable. And recent market moves along with mixed economic data are providing a lesson in humility for swaths on Wall Street. Thursday’s GDP report was especially jarring, showing growth a scant 1.6% and core inflation at 3.7%, both outside the predictions of all the estimates in Bloomberg surveys.\n\n“The recent spate of hotter-than-expected inflation data is throwing a wrench in most people’s models. It’s always difficult to spot inflection points in markets,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. “It’s hard to be humble and admit that you don’t know which way things will go, so we have to talk about the importance of diversification and some tail risk hedges.”\n\nStory continues\n\nA week after sliding 5.4%, the Nasdaq 100 bounced back to climb 4%, including a 3.3% gain in its seven mightiest stocks on Friday alone. Investors who had been bailing from equities and junk bonds found themselves diving back in this week, according to Bank of America citing EPFR Global.\n\nResilience was the theme of the week in every market except Treasuries, where yields hovered at multi-month highs. Interest-coverage ratios have improved for both investment-grade and junk bonds amid strong earnings and lingering bets on monetary easing, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The ratio between companies’ earnings and their interest expense is starting to rise again, signaling they have more income to service their debt.\n\nFor William Hobbs, head of UK multi-asset wealth at Barclays Wealth Management, this was an opportunity to buy the dip and tilt the broader portfolio in favor of risk.\n\n“In spite of the box office start to the year for many developed stock markets, our proprietary measures of investor sentiment and positioning are not close to flashing red,” Hobbs said.\n\nYet, signs of anxiety were brewing amid a week of uneven earnings results, with the drops in Meta and IBM more than offset by weekly gains of 12% in Google parent Alphabet and a 14% rally in Tesla Inc. The Cboe NDX Volatility Index — a gauge of option costs tied to the Nasdaq 100 — has been hovering around 20 after spiking to its highest level since October last week.\n\nConsensus forecasts still put net margins for the tech sector at all-time highs by the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is one reason risk assets have continued to defy threats from rising bond yields even as their valuations and expected cash flows are influenced by interest-rate changes. The result this week: a trouncing of value stocks by their growth counterparts.\n\nYet all this threatens to set up fresh stock-bond clashes ahead, with Fed officials gathering next week against the backdrop of a red-hot Wall Street and stubborn price pressures.\n\n“Tighter financial conditions are appropriate to cool a booming US economy,” said Tiffany Wilding, economist at Pimco. “Based on recent comments, the Fed appears poised to deliver, by remaining on hold for longer. In other words, the pivot party is over.”\n\n--With assistance from Ye Xie and Emily Graffeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The surge comes after firms like Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. pledged billions in AI investments.\n\n“The future is AI,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares. “And if the largest companies in the world are pouring tens of billions of dollars each into this, I think Nvidia has to be the big winner.”\n\nThe move is a sharp reversal from last Friday’s 10% plunge, the shares’ worst day in more than four years, which came amid fears that enthusiasm for chipmakers had run too far too fast after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. scaled back its expansion outlook.\n\nNvidia currently dominates the lucrative market for accelerators that power data centers running complex computing tasks required for AI development. But the entire semiconductor industry is climbing, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, also known as the SOX, up 9.7% this week, compared with a 2.8% gain in the broader S&P 500 Index and a 4% jump in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nFirst-quarter reports “from key US hyperscalers - Google, Microsoft and Meta - suggest meaningful upside to CY24 capex, mostly driven by buildout of AI infrastructure,” Bank of America Corp. analysts lead by Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients on April 25.\n\nMeta shares were pressured on Thursday, tumbling 11%, after the Facebook-parent revealed that it will spend billions of dollars more than expected on AI this year. But Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet were able to convince investors that spending on AI was already paying off.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com Inc., another big Nvidia customer, is slated to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.\n\n“I hate to say things are a no-brainer,” Marino said. “But if you take a look at all the budget lines and all the capex spending, where is that going? It’s got to go to Nvidia, they have the best chips.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. closed decisively above a $2 trillion market capitalization for the first time on Friday, as a powerhouse earnings report reassured investors that the Google parent would be a major player in artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Fed’s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Billionaire Stephen Ross Believes in South Florida—and Is Spending Big to Transform It Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe stock rose 10% to $171.95, its biggest one-day jump since July 2015, resulting in a valuation of $2.15 trillion. The advance added almost $200 billion to the company’s market capitalization, making for one of the largest single-day value adds in stock market history. Shares have risen 23% this year, compared with the 5.3% gain of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nThe $2 trillion milestone followed the company’s results, where revenue beat expectations on the strength of its cloud-computing unit. Cloud demand was fueled by growth in AI, while Alphabet also cheered investors by introducing a dividend and announcing a $70 billion buyback program.\n\nRead more: Microsoft, Google Gain After AI Fuels Cloud Computing Demand\n\n“Alphabet is tremendously well managed, its free cash flow is absolutely astonishing, and it has a massive R&D budget, so while no one knows what company will have the best AI products, this is a tough one to bet against,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services.\n\nWhile the stock breached the $2 trillion level on an intraday basis in 2021, and again earlier this month, this is the first time Alphabet has closed above it. Doing so puts it into rarefied territory — only Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp, Saudi Aramco, and Nvidia Corp. have surpassed the threshold. Nvidia — driven by the massive demand for its AI chips — surpassed $2 trillion earlier this year, while Amazon.com Inc. isn’t far from $2 trillion itself.\n\nThe path to $2 trillion has been somewhat rocky. The stock has been volatile amid some high-profile criticism about the company’s AI offerings, and prior to the latest report, some investors had questioned its ability to compete with firms like OpenAI in this critical area despite spending heavily in the field for years.\n\nWall Street remains broadly positive on the stock, as nearly 85% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying. Both earnings and revenue are expected to grow at a double-digit pace every year through 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the stock continues to look like something of a bargain. Shares trade around 23.5 times estimated earnings, making it among the cheapest of the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock also trades at a discount to the Nasdaq 100, and is only modestly above its 10-year average multiple.\n\n(Updates to market close.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nSnap jumps after Q1 rev, user growth beat\n\n*\n\nIntel down after dour Q2 forecast\n\n*\n\nFutures up: Dow 0.14%, S&P 0.78%, Nasdaq 1.05%\n\n(Updated at 7:12 a.m. ET/1112 GMT)\n\nBy Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan\n\nApril 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures advanced on Friday as megacap growth shares rebounded on the back of robust quarterly results from Alphabet and Microsoft, while investors awaited a key inflation print that could help shape U.S. monetary policy.\n\nAlphabet jumped 12.1% in premarket trading after the Google-parent announced its first-ever dividend, a $70 billion stock buyback and beat estimates for first-quarter results.\n\nThe share surge could lead to the search giant's market value topping $2 trillion, if premarket gains hold.\n\nLifting sentiment further, Microsoft gained 4.4% on beating Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by gains from AI adoption across its cloud services.\n\n\"After Meta's miss, this was exactly what the markets needed,\" Johan Javeus, senior economist at SEB, said in a note.\n\n\"Many investors who had been impatiently waiting for AI investments to also bring in higher revenues probably drew a sigh of relief when Alphabet's CFO Ruth Porat said that 'we saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions'.\"\n\nOther growth stocks also rose on the results, with Amazon.com and Nvidia up 3.2% and 1.6%, respectively. Meta Platforms added 1.4%, after its near 11% drop in the previous session, which was its steepest fall in 18 months.\n\nOn the flip side, Exxon Mobil lost 0.7% after the largest U.S. oil company missed analysts' estimates with a 28% year-on-year drop in first-quarter profit.\n\nThe upbeat earnings across several sectors this week have propped up Wall Street's main stock indexes for weekly gains, with the benchmark S&P 500 looking to snap three weeks of losses while the Nasdaq is set to end four straight weeks of declines.\n\nFocus now shifts to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index reading for March, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, to further ascertain the state of inflation and the timing of interest rate cuts.\n\nThe index is estimated to show a 2.6% rise in March on a year-on-year basis, as per economists polled by Reuters, compared with a 2.5% rise in February.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in just about 35 basis points (bps) of rate cuts from the central bank this year, down from nearly 150 bps seen at the beginning of the year, as per LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 52 points, or 0.14%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 39.75 points, or 0.78%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 184 points, or 1.05%.\n\nAmong other stocks, Snap surged 24.6% premarket after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for quarterly revenue and user growth. Shares of Pinterest also rose 4.8%.\n\nIntel dropped 8.2% on forecasting second-quarter revenue and profit below estimates as it faces weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips and trails in the surging market for AI components.\n\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft, Google Gain After AI Fuels Cloud Computing Demand",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. sent a clear message to investors on Thursday: Our spending on artificial intelligence and cloud computing is paying off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Huawei’s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe companies trounced Wall Street estimates with their latest quarterly results, lifted by a surge in cloud revenue — fueled in part by booming use of AI services. That sent shares of the companies up in late trading, with Alphabet soaring as much as 17% and Microsoft gaining 6.3%.\n\nThe tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle for dominance in the field of artificial intelligence, with Microsoft joining forces with startup OpenAI to challenge Google’s two-decade stranglehold on internet search. But Thursday’s results showed there’s ample room for both companies to grow.\n\nSilicon Valley has hailed 2024 as the year that companies will begin to deploy generative AI — technology that can create text, images and videos from simple prompts. In back-to-back earnings calls, Alphabet and Microsoft executives said the programs are driving more business for their cloud computing units.\n\nCorporate customers are more open to making long-term investments in their cloud infrastructure, said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. That’s helped make the sometimes-volatile industry more reliable.\n\n“It’s quite clear from these earnings from Microsoft and Google that cloud infrastructure demand is starting to normalize,” Dessai said. “Foundational cloud infrastructure is showing healthy growth.”\n\nRising cloud computing demand comes as a welcome turn for Google, which has long trailed Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft in the market. After breaking even for the first time last year, Google’s cloud operation posted first-quarter profit of $900 million — well ahead of analysts’ projections of $672.4 million. The unit is viewed as one of Google’s best bets for growth as its core search advertising business matures.\n\n“For years, Google Cloud was usually a weak spot during Alphabet’s earnings calls,” said Lee Sustar, a principal analyst with Forrester Research Inc. “These latest results show that Google Cloud’s AI offerings not only got enterprise customers to take another look, but spend some serious money.”\n\nGoogle’s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks in the consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model Gemini was roundly criticized after it spit out historically inaccurate images, prompting the company to stop generating depictions of people.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe enterprise side of the market has been a very different story, according to Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help marketers ensure that the content is staying consistent with their brands. The service can be used to produce ads, ward off cyber threats, and even create videos and podcasts.\n\n“We are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers,” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on Thursday. “We saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions.”\n\nFor Microsoft, generative AI is letting the company wring more spending from its core enterprise clients. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft’s entire product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI. The bet is starting to pay off, with some customers adding AI tools that summarize documents and generate content. They’re also signing up for Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products.\n\nMicrosoft said sales of its Azure cloud computing platform climbed 31% in the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. About 7% of that increase was attributable to AI, compared with 6% in the previous quarter, and Microsoft is pleased with customer adoption so far, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview.\n\n“You’re seeing healthy growth really across Azure, in the non-AI and AI services, which is important,” Hood said. “While of course it’s still early in the long-term AI monetization opportunity, we feel good about where we are.”\n\nMicrosoft’s GitHub coding platform is also gaining traction, recording 1.8 million customers during the period, up from 1.3 million last quarter. The AI-coding assistant is powered by OpenAI’s large language model and helps streamline developers’ work by predicting lines of code, answering questions and converting code from one programming language to another. Corporate subscribers range from small startups to large businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Ernst & Young.\n\nThe company is also seeing promising initial uptake for an AI assistant meant to work with its Office software. The new tools cost companies an extra $30 a month on top of existing subscriptions. Nadella told analysts almost 60% of Fortune 500 customers are using the Copilot.\n\nNot everyone reporting earnings on Thursday had good news to share. Intel Corp. gave a lackluster forecast for sales and profit in the current quarter, sending its shares tumbling in extended trading. The chipmaker said it expects business to pick up again in the second half of the year.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet needed to deliver a strong performance to avoid spooking investors, who sent shares of Meta Platforms Inc. down Thursday after the Facebook parent said during its Wednesday’s earnings that it would invest billions of dollars more than expected on AI. Alphabet spent $12 billion on capital expenditures in the quarter, roughly twice its total from the year-ago quarter, and Porat told investors to expect similar spending for the rest of the year. After investing $14 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter, Microsoft said its spending will continue to rise.\n\n“We’re seeing the AI demand continue to grow, and so we’ll continue to work to match that,” Hood said.\n\n--With assistance from Dina Bass and Davey Alba.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech Reverses US Stock Losses as Treasuries Drop: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stellar earnings reports from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc triggered an after-hours tech rally that sent US futures higher. A selloff in Treasuries drove benchmark yields to new highs for the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Big Tech Surges in Late Hours on Blowout Earnings: Markets Wrap Biden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World\n\nFutures contracts for the S&P 500 rallied 0.8% in early Asian trading Friday, while those for the Nasdaq 100 rose more than 1%. The moves unwound Thursday’s losses of around 0.5% for each benchmark and came after Microsoft and Alphabet both beat Wall Street profit estimates. Snap Inc. also rallied in late trading on a bullish revenue projection.\n\nAsian futures were mixed with Japanese contracts rising, while those for Australia and Hong Kong inched lower — although trading occurred prior to the two tech giants’ results, meaning sentiment may swing by the time Asian markets open.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasuries suffered further losses, as the prospect of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts remains a way off. Swap traders have now pushed back the timing of the first rate reduction to December.\n\nA closely watched measure of underlying US inflation advanced at a faster-than-expected 3.7% clip. The print combined with a US gross domestic product data that trailed all forecasts to rekindle the specter of stagflation.\n\n“This report was the worst of both worlds: economic growth is slowing and inflationary pressures are persisting,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. “The Fed wants to see inflation start coming down in a persistent manner, but the market wants to see economic growth and corporate profits increasing.”\n\nThe yen was little changed early Friday ahead of the Bank of Japan’s latest interest-rate decision. Elsewhere in the region, data due Friday includes Tokyo inflation data, Australian producer prices, and Singapore industrial output.\n\nTech Optimism\n\nA $250 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (ticker: QQQ) climbed 1.2% after the close of regular trading on Thursday. In a sigh of relief to investors worried about lofty valuations of the sector that has powered the bull market, Alphabet crushed sales estimates and announced a dividend. Fellow megacap Microsoft also beat forecasts, lifted by corporate demand for the software maker’s cloud and artificial-intelligence offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shown they are excited about the prospects of AI — but want tech companies to continue to focus on revenue and profit in the meantime.\n\nLike other big techs, Alphabet has been plowing money into developing AI, a strategy that has helped drive demand for its cloud services. Google is a distant third in the cloud-computing market, trailing Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, but the company’s prowess in AI could help it close the gap.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nJapan rate decision, Tokyo CPI, inflation and GDP forecasts, Friday US personal income and spending, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday Exxon Mobil, Chevron earnings, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 0.8% as of 7:41 a.m. Tokyo time Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.2% Nikkei 225 futures rose 0.6% Hang Seng futures fell 0.1% S&P/ASX 200 futures fell 0.3%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0729 The Japanese yen was little changed at 155.60 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2552 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 0.2% to $64,659.68 Ether fell 0.3% to $3,163.81\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 4.70% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 0.890% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced 11 basis points to 4.51%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $83.76 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger Big Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The roadshow pitch from Rubrik (RBRK) ahead of its Thursday IPO: In the fast-paced world of AI, we can protect data — and eventually make a load of money doing it.\n\nSaid pitch worked.\n\nRubrik stock surged 17% to $37 by the close of a rocky day on Wall Street, a sizzling response to another AI ecosystem play, similar to the appetite for Reddit's (RDDT) newly issued shares just a few weeks earlier.\n\n\"We were preparing for this moment for several years, and the market was receptive,\" Rubrik co-founder, chairman, and CEO Bipul Sinha told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nShares of the cybersecurity firm were priced late Wednesday at $32, above the high-end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.\n\nThe upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.\n\nIt was just this January when Rubrik — which Microsoft (MSFT) has invested in since 2021 — raised a Series E round that valued the company at $3.3 billion. That round was led by Bain, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures. The firm was valued at around $1.8 billion in a prior 2017 raise.\n\n\"The company is one to watch,\" an early Rubrik investor told Yahoo Finance. Bipul Sinha, CEO, Chairman & Co-Founder of Rubrik Inc., the Microsoft-backed cybersecurity software startup, rings the opening bell during his company’s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 25, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA key part of Rubrik's selling point is its well-regarded tech exec, Sinha.\n\nThe former engineer has spent extensive time in the venture capital industry. As a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sinha put dollars behind names such as Nutanix (NTNX) and Pulse News. (Lightspeed is now a major shareholder in Rubrik, with about 24.9% of shares outstanding).\n\nHe has also held engineering positions at Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).\n\nSinha founded Rubrik in 2014, working in coffee shops by the offices of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube in an effort to hire top developer talent.\n\nHe doesn't hide his modest upbringing, which has fueled his business building. \"Maximal thinking is how I lifted myself out of poverty,\" Sinha wrote in a letter in the company's IPO prospectus.\n\n\"He is the American Dream come true.\" Lightspeed Venture Partner's co-founder and partner Ravi Mhatre told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSinha said he remains as hungry as ever, despite the newfound attention around Rubrik and its future.\n\nWhile the cybersecurity market remains in growth mode, Rubrik does have to prove its worth to Wall Street. The company disclosed a loss of $354 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2024, despite subscription revenue rising 40% to $537.9 million. It posted a loss of $278 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company noted in its prospectus that it has had losses in each period since its inception.\n\n\"Profits are paramount,\" Sinha acknowledged, though he declined to share a precise timeline on when those profits would appear on the balance sheet.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Google\n\nGoogle’s parent company soared past a $2 trillion valuation last night as the search engine giant said it would pay a dividend for the first time.\n\nShares in Alphabet rose by more than 12pc to a record high as the company announced the payout to shareholders, alongside a $70bn (£56bn) share buyback scheme.\n\nMicrosoft shares also rose after the world’s most valuable company revealed record profits. It meant both tech giants shrugged off a tech sell-off earlier in the day triggered by fears about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $80.5bn for the first quarter of the year, a 15pc rise, and said profits had climbed by 57pc to $23.7bn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt said it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, amounting to a payout of more than $2.5bn, and that it planned to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future. It comes after Meta said it would pay its first dividend in February.\n\nMicrosoft shares climbed by more than 5pc after sales jumped on growing demand for its AI technology. Quarterly revenues rose 17pc to $61.9bn while profits were up 20pc, at $21.9bn.\n\nGoogle has faced questions about whether it is falling behind companies such as OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, as well as concerns that the rise of AI could threaten its lucrative search engine.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has been seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ChatGPT craze. It is a major investor in OpenAI and has built the chatbot into many of its own products. It overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable listed company earlier this year.\n\nBut investors had questioned whether the hype and heavy spending around AI is turning into tangible revenues.\n\nThe figures came after a wider tech sell-off earlier in the day after Facebook owner Meta reported disappointing results on Wednesday night. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had fallen by as much as 2pc before a slight recovery.\n\nMeta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth drop by more than $17bn after Meta’s stock plunged by 10pc as investors baulked at his plans to invest billions into AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe billionaire, whose fortune is almost entirely made up of his shares in the company, lost his position as the world’s third-richest person to Elon Musk this week after a leap in Tesla’s shares made a recovery.\n\nMr Zuckerberg is now worth approximately $150bn following a share price rout last night. Mr Musk is worth about $179bn as of yesterday.\n\nMore than $100bn was wiped from Meta’s market value as investors baulked at Mr Zuckerberg’s plans to spend heavily on AI technology.",

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYou have to spend money to make money\n\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\n\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\n\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\n\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited in the pursuit of AI\n\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\n\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday. Chinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports. The potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. MSFT Chart\n\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI. Investors should ignore the short-term volatility and buy the dip.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 22, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up an impressive 171% over the last five years. We note the stock price is up 2.4% in the last seven days.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Alphabet managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 22%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time.

Check if analysts think Alphabet will grow revenue in the future.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 53% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has His Sights on Only 1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, and It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "When you look at the stock portfolios of most billionaire hedge fund managers, you'll find plenty of the Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as exposure to some of the most promising AI stocks. But that isn't the case in Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund's portfolio. In fact, despite having about $10 billion invested in the stock market, there are only seven different stocks in its latest SEC filings, and only one is a Magnificent Seven tech stock -- Google parent company Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nAs of the latest information, Pershing Square owns more than 13.7 million shares of Alphabet, with a total market value of $1.93 billion. This accounts for about 19% of Pershing's portfolio and makes it the hedge fund's largest investment.\n\nUnlike some of the other investments in Ackman's portfolio, he hasn't held Alphabet shares long, adding shares of both Class A and Class C shares to the portfolio in early 2023. Here's a closer look at Alphabet's business and why Ackman might be such a fan.\n\nAlphabet in a nutshell\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, which most people know for the Google search engine, as well as other tools like Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and Android. These, and a few other parts of the business, such as YouTube, make up the Google Services segment, which primarily makes its money by selling advertising on its various platforms.\n\nThe lesser-known part of the business (by most investors) is Google Cloud, the cloud services business. It's a competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, and is the number three cloud services provider, with a smaller share than either of those.\n\nThere are a few other components of Alphabet's business, but the two Google segments produce virtually all of its revenue.\n\nA tremendous combination of profitability and growth potential\n\nFirst off, Alphabet is a tremendously profitable business. It generated a net margin of 24% over the past four quarters and produced more than $88 billion in operating income in 2023 alone. The company also has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, and the combination of cash reserves and massive cash flow gives it excellent financial flexibility.\n\nSecond, Alphabet has a rare combination of a dominant business and massive growth potential. Many people reading this couldn't say what the number two search engine is without looking it up, and some of the other Google platforms are similarly dominant.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's ad revenue should grow significantly over time, especially as it leverages AI and other technologies to target advertisements at the right consumers and businesses more effectively. The Google Cloud side of the company in particular could have incredible growth potential. The global cloud computing market is expected to roughly quadruple in size by 2030, and Google Cloud could be a big beneficiary. In the most recent quarter, Google Cloud revenue grew by 26% year over year, and this level of growth could continue for many years to come.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAlphabet isn't exactly a cheap stock, trading for 28 times forward earnings estimates. But you get what you pay for in this case. Alphabet has the trifecta -- profitability, dominance, and growth potential -- and considering where it stands on all three of those, it looks attractively valued.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AI spending worries cast gloom over Alphabet, Microsoft",
        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\n(Reuters) - Investors appear to be losing patience with Big Tech's prodigious artificial intelligence investments this week after Meta Platforms signaled deeper spending and a long road to profitability.\n\nThe concession from Meta in its quarterly report late on Wednesday cast a cloud over Microsoft and Alphabet, which will both report quarterly earnings on Thursday.\n\nMeta's stock sank 15% in extended trade after it forecast higher AI spending next year, while Microsoft was down 2%, Alphabet fell 3% and Nvidia dropped 1.4% in reaction.\n\nWall Street's heavyweight tech-related companies have been locked in a fierce battle to advance generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech.\n\nDuring Meta's earnings conference call, analysts peppered CEO Mark Zuckerberg with questions about how the company was pacing its AI investments. One analyst asked whether Meta was spending more because it saw an even bigger opportunity from AI.\n\n\"I think we've gotten more ambitious and optimistic on AI,\" Zuckerberg responded, pointing to Meta's recent launches of new AI models. \"So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\"\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft both said earlier this year when they reported fourth-quarter results that they expected rising AI costs. The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\n\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\n\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\n\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\n\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\n\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin; additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Up 6,326% Since IPO, Is It Too Late to Buy MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Stock?",
        "content": "One of the most popular tech stocks in the last decade is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), a Latin American company. MELI stock went public in August 2007. Since then, it has returned a staggering 6,326%, outpacing the broader markets by a wide margin. It means a $500 investment in MELI stock just after its IPO would be worth over $31,200 today. Comparatively, the S&P 500 (SPX) would have turned $500 into $2,386 after adjusting for dividends since August 2007. But does this mean it’s too late to buy MELI stock now?\n\nWhile MercadoLibre will not be able to replicate its historical returns, I’m bullish on the stock due to its widening portfolio of solutions, earnings growth profile, and reasonable valuation.\n\nAn Overview of MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America based on the number of orders and unique visitors. A Brazil-based company, it has a presence in 17 other countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, Chile, and Peru. MercadoLibre is valued at $70.7 billion.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and caters to a region with more than 650 million people. Its fintech platform, MercadoPago, offers a diverse range of fintech products, such as debit cards, online payments, credit lines, savings, insurance, and investments.\n\nHow Did MercadoLibre Perform in Q4 of 2023?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment, MercadoLibre reported revenue of $4.26 billion in Q4 of 2023, an increase of 42% year-over-year. In fact the company’s top line grew at the fastest pace since Q3 of 2022. Its adjusted net income stood at $572 million, indicating a healthy margin of 13.2%.\n\nMercadoLibre reported gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $13.5 billion as growth in items sold rose to 29%, the highest in over two years. The e-commerce giant attributed its GMV growth to strong demand from Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\nThe expansion of its fulfillment network meant that MercadoLibre carried roughly 50% of its shipments in Q4 of 2023, a new record. It also delivered 122 million packages on the same or next day, an increase of 21% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nIn the Fintech business, MercadoLibre’s total payment volume, or TPV, touched $56.5 billion. It emphasized that off-platform TPV growth accelerated in key markets, growing by triple-digit rates. Moreover, it ended 2023 with a credit portfolio of $3.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year.\n\nA Focus on Consumer Electronics and AI\n\nMercadoLibre emphasized that the Consumer Electronics (CE) segment is its largest single online category in Latin America. To gain traction in this segment, it leverages technology to manage pricing, inventory, and supplier relationships. While MercadoLibre provides competitive offers in this category, it continues to grow margins in the Consumer Electronics vertical, allowing it to push harder for growth. For instance, during the Black Friday promotional campaign, the CE category grew by 140% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, MercadoLibre launched capabilities to enable sellers to create their own promotional coupons and answer buyers’ questions quickly due to its AI-powered platform. MercadoLibre also launched a new affiliates program and ramped up short-form videos to expand social media tools that drive traffic to seller listings.\n\nIts widening capabilities meant that MercadoLibre shipped 650 million items in 2023, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Further, the e-commerce giant believes investments in its fulfillment infrastructure should improve the value proposition for buyers and sellers.\n\nOnline Ads Will be a Key Revenue Driver\n\nSimilar to Amazon, MercadoLibre is well positioned to drive top-line growth due to digital ad sales, which is a high-margin business. Currently, Amazon is the third-largest digital ad platform in the world, after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn 2023, MercadoLibre relaunched its ads tech stack. It launched an automated buying platform for display ads while providing live reports and other insights to advertisers. Its tech stack for ads also includes a feature for agencies to manage multiple brands on the platform.\n\nFinally, the company launched Mercado Play, an ads-based streaming platform that operates on a revenue share model with studios. MercadoLibre is offering free content to users, as it unlocked a new revenue stream for the ads business.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for MELI Stock?\n\nOut of the 12 analyst ratings given to MELI stock, 10 are Buys, two are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MELI stock price target is $1,935.45, indicating upside potential of 41.3% from current levels.\n\nWall Street expects MercadoLibre to increase its revenue from $14.47 billion in 2023 to $17.7 billion in 2024. Comparatively, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $19.46 per share in 2023 to $32.98 per share in 2024. So, priced at 41.5 times forward earnings, MELI stock might seem expensive, given that the sector median multiple is much lower at 14.9x. However, MELI is on track to grow the bottom line by 72.5% this year, so it deserves a premium valuation.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMercadoLibre’s expanding portfolio of products enables the company to unlock additional revenue streams while contributing to earnings growth. Its broadening base of customers and robust ecosystem of online solutions position the firm to benefit from secular growth trends in the upcoming decade. Basically, MELI is a fast-growing large-cap stock that looks poised to beat the broader markets in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The race for human-AI interaction usage data is on—and the stakes are high",
        "content": "With the announcement of its new Llama 3 model, Meta is getting ready to put artificial intelligence across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. It’s a move that could eventually put the model in the hands of more than 3 billion daily users. This unprecedented flow of human-AI interaction data could help Meta pull ahead in the AI race.\n\nFor the past year, OpenAI’s GPT-4 has been the dominant large language model. The LLM’s popularity dwarfs that of rival offerings from Google, Meta, and Mistral, but the gap in model quality is getting smaller and smaller. After Cohere’s Command R+, Llama 3 is the second openly available model this month to surpass the original GPT-4 in the popular LMSYS Chatbot Arena. In the past couple of days, we saw Microsoft launch its Phi-3 models, and even Snowflake entered the race with an LLM of its own. The language model space is getting increasingly crowded, and its players struggle to set themselves apart.\n\nThe intense competition makes for a fast-moving space. An incredible technical breakthrough one day can become table stakes in a matter of months, as competitors quickly adapt their approach. Innovation in architectures and algorithms has not led to a defensible competitive advantage. Neither has budget or scale, even as big tech and VCs pour in billions of dollars in funding. The one way a lasting advantage might be found is via more and better data.\n\nA positive feedback loop for AI\n\nThe research accompanying recent LLM releases has shown that even models trained on billions of words of training text remain undertrained. Increasing the data volume and quality is a proven way to drive performance. With the leading players already consuming most suitable public training data, the next place to look will be LLM usage itself. The data that stems from how we query and guide language models through conversations is more than just a volume augmentation—it can help reinforce what models already do well, and target and improve where they struggle. OpenAI and Google, which both offer their models directly to end users through a chat interface, have already started building that dataset.\n\nWhen usage data improves quality, and quality drives more usage, the positive feedback loop can turn a space into a near-monopoly. We’ve seen this story before with search engines. While Google first pulled ahead thanks to an innovative ranking algorithm using public data, it has managed to maintain and grow that lead by learning from the massive volume of usage data originating from its users. This has left other players struggling to capture even a small fraction of the market. Even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified last summer that Bing is worse than Google—and that it’s all tied to data.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe still need to see a company capitalize on the AI usage feedback loop effectively. While improvements to GPT-4 since its initial release likely stem in part from usage data, the changes feel iterative rather than transformational. With over 100 million monthly active users, however, OpenAI has built an unprecedented conversational dataset. With the highly anticipated GPT-5 rumored to be released this summer, we may finally see that data come into play. From there on, we could watch OpenAI widen the gap and continue asserting its dominance.\n\nEven if quality gains from usage data were modest, your past interactions would still enable a model to tailor its ways to you better than anyone else. According to Sam Altman, that’s where the real long-term differentiation for AI models lies: knowing you best.\n\nMainstream AI will be delivered via messaging apps and social networks\n\nThe data feedback loop and OpenAI’s upcoming release make Meta’s timing particularly interesting. Much more than just claiming the time and attention of billions of people, Meta owns the default place most people go to chat. Bringing their Llama-based AI capabilities straight into that inbox could potentially grow adoption faster than the eye-watering rate of ChatGPT.\n\nIn the remainder of the year, we will likely see AI providers that can capitalize on user data pull ahead of everyone else. Players who own the virtual spaces where people interact with their models will be in much better shape than those who just provide the models but can’t collect the data. That’s great news for OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, but could leave other non-Big Tech contenders like Mistral and Cohere out in the cold.\n\nNext year’s AI space will likely have a very different competitive dynamic than what we see today. While overwhelming funding and competitive open-source models make the most powerful AI capabilities surprisingly cheap today, that price point is unlikely to be sustained once only the big players can deliver the strongest AI experience. Meta’s current habit of open-sourcing its models makes it the friendliest option today, but it may reconsider when other open-source players fall behind. Today’s top-notch AI is probably the most open and accessible we’ll ever see—we’ll do well to enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nJeroen Van Hautteis the cofounder & CPO/CTO at TechWolf, a VC-backed AI/HR-tech startup based in Ghent, Belgium.

        "content": "The social justice activism that marked the post-summer 2020 years in pedagogical and corporate institutions appears to be coming to a halt. From the halls of Ivy League universities to those of corporate America, more leaders are tamping down on protests and demanding a renewed focus on business priorities.\n\nThis week, many pro-Palestinian student protesters were arrested on college campuses like Yale University, while Google fired more than 30 employees who protested its cloud deal with Israel. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a company blog post that the office is not a place “to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.”\n\nStill, the company's firing has sparked a debate about the intersection of workplace activism and corporate policies and how to navigate the tension that arises from the sometimes dueling sides. The tech giant said the now terminated protesters caused “physical disruption” inside its buildings, though some organizers of the protest say not all who were fired were disruptive.\n\nKnown for its progressive culture, Google is now facing criticism for allegedly stifling dissent and breaching its values of openness and inclusivity. Critics have also argued that terminating employees for in-office protests suffocates dialogue on vital issues like societal injustices and raises doubts about the company's commitment to fostering a culture of free expression.\n\nOn the opposing end, supporters of Google's move say that employees, too, must recognize their responsibility as representatives of the company and advocate for change in a manner that respects their colleagues. While protest is a powerful tool, they say, it must be wielded thoughtfully to avoid negatively affecting others.\n\nGoogle asserted that the protests created an uncomfortable environment for other employees and emphasized that staff can use internal forums to address grievances rather than resort to protests that impede business.\n\nAlthough Pichai didn’t specifically mention the Israel–Hamas war in his blog post, he stated that the $1.92 trillion company “is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe.\"\n\nYet companies today no longer have the luxury of avoiding sensitive and often contentious social and political issues, and missteps in handling employee activism can be damaging for leaders.\n\nHow to engage with employee activists\n\nI spoke to a handful of management consultants on the right way to engage with employee activists. Overall, they said that balancing employee activism and workplace policies requires a commitment from both employers and employees to engage in open and respectful communication, uphold company values, and collaborate to find solutions that allow for dissent and adherence to company standards. Of note, they recommended that leaders:\n\nStory continues\n\nEstablish clear guidelines on acceptable forms of workplace activism that outline how employees can constructively express their views within the confines of company policies.\n\nEncourage open dialogue through internal forums, town halls, and employee resource groups that allow employees to voice their concerns and find solutions.\n\nRecognize and respect the diversity of opinions within the workplace and encourage employees to do the same.\n\nAddress conflicts proactively and seek mutually acceptable solutions to prevent escalation and maintain a harmonious work environment.\n\nRuth Umoh @ruthumohnews\r\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "TikTok artists and advertisers to stay with app until 'door slams shut'",
        "content": "By Sheila Dang, Dawn Chmielewski and Danielle Broadway\n\nApril 24 (Reuters) - Ban or no ban, TikTok's partners in the music and advertising world plan to stick with the massively popular short-form video platform until the bitter end, seven industry leaders told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed a bill late on Tuesday that gives Chinese tech firm ByteDance up to a year to divest TikTok, or the app will be banned altogether. President Joe Biden has signaled he would sign the bill, capping a four-year battle over concerns the Chinese government could influence content or access user data.\n\nTikTok has rivaled larger companies such as Meta Platforms for user attention and ad budgets, and its cultural power is reflected in its ability to catapult emerging artists into viral hits, changing how young people discover music.\n\nAs long as TikTok's users remain engaged with the app, \"advertisers will ride it all the way until the door slams shut,\" said Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3.\n\nAdamm Miguest, CEO and founder of Rapid Launch Media, which creates marketing campaigns designed to make songs go viral, said he will advise clients to stay on TikTok as long as they can.\n\nEven Universal Music, whose artists' songs disappeared from TikTok in March as licensing talks stalled, has resumed negotiations in recent weeks, according to two people close to the discussions. The talks reflect the realization that, whatever the outcome of the legislative process, TikTok is not going away tomorrow, one of the sources said. Universal declined to comment.\n\nThe app's importance is also underscored by how superstar Taylor Swift, a Universal artist, defied her label by putting her music back on TikTok just weeks later.\n\n\"I think we have to look and ask, why did Taylor Swift do that? Even she recognizes the power that TikTok yields,\" said Johnny Cloherty, CEO of Songfluencer, a creative marketing firm that has worked with artists like Dolly Parton and Miranda Lambert.\n\nMusicians aim to get songs circulating on TikTok or other platforms such as Instagram Reels and then have users listen to the music on streaming services. TikTok posts are far more likely to lead to streams, Miguest said, who has worked with musicians including Muni Long and Sueco.\n\n\"From what I've seen, you have to get 10 to 20 times the amount of posts on Reels for it to even come close to translating to what you might get on TikTok,\" he said.\n\nTikTok also beats Google's YouTube as the most common music discovery source for teens in the U.S., said Tatiana Cirisano, a senior music industry analyst for Midia Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nTikTok has long said it has not and never would share U.S. user data with the Chinese government. It is expected to challenge the bill.\n\n\"This is the beginning, not the end of this long process,\" TikTok told staff on Saturday, Reuters previously reported.\n\n\"This unconstitutional law is a TikTok ban, and we will challenge it in court,\" a spokesperson said on Wednesday. \"We believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side, and we will ultimately prevail.\"\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nRIVALS ON THE HUNT\n\nOther tech platforms are waiting in the wings for TikTok's users and ad revenue.\n\nYouTube has been particularly aggressive in going after TikTok marketing budgets, asking ad agencies to test one of its advertising products to see how it performs against TikTok specifically, according to one advertising agency director, who declined to be named to discuss conversations with the platforms.\n\nRecent surveys have shown that Gen-Z are increasingly using TikTok to search for information and businesses rather than Google. Google did not respond to request for comment.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors on Tuesday that short-form video content is \"a big focus of ours,\" which would make its way to the service's music streaming product in 2024.\n\nEven with their commitment to the platform, advertisers are beginning to shift from their theoretical contingency plans, which have long been in place, to actively testing plan Bs, Atkinson said.\n\n\"If we imagine a continuum of 'maybe this will happen someday,' to the idea that TikTok will be turned off, we've moved one step over,\" he said.\n\nBoth advertisers and music artists have taken steps to test and diversify their strategies across other platforms, including Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. \"But none of them have quite garnered the attention that TikTok did,\" said Gabriel Lister, managing partner of record label Independent Co.\n\n\"The question is whether any of those platforms could replace TikTok's cultural heft — I don't believe it would simply be a case of TikTok users migrating over to the competitors,\" said Midia's Cirisano.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, TikTok will host a glitzy evening presentation for advertisers in New York City next week as part of an annual event organized by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a trade group.\n\nThere were no changes to the plans as of Tuesday, the IAB said.

        "content": "Elon Musk's Big Bet: Tesla to Ramp Up AI Development with Nvidia's Powerful Chips\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) may install 85,000 Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 chips by year-end to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nIf CEO Elon Musk proceeds with this plan, Tesla will surpass tech giants like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a significant Nvidia customer.\n\nDuring Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report for 2024, Musk disclosed that the company currently possesses 35,000 H100 chips, the most advanced and expensive graphics processing units designed for AI applications, CNBC reports.\n\nThese chips are vital for Musk’s AI initiatives, which include the development of advanced robots like Optimus Bot and Robotaxi and a supercomputer named Dojo.\n\nReports indicate that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is Nvidia’s largest customer.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Nvidia produced 550,000 chips last year, and companies must wait until 2024 to secure additional supplies.\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest buyer, as stated by Omdia, with an order of 150,000 GPUs in 2023. Other significant purchasers include Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Google, and Amazon, each reportedly acquiring 50,000 chips. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon nearly account for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. CNBC writes.\n\nMusk had mocked Nvidia’s substantial market capitalization loss on April 19, calling the 10% stock decline “rookie numbers” on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNvidia experienced a significant drop in stock value, shedding $211 billion in market capitalization, marking the second-largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThis steep decline was triggered by disappointing earnings from ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and a pessimistic market outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nMeanwhile, analysts maintained their bullish stance on Nvidia, expecting it to rule the accelerator market primarily backed by its Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 205% in the last 12 months. Tesla stock lost 11%.\n\nPrice Actions: TSLA shares traded higher by 11.40% at $161.21 premarket at the last check Wednesday.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report NVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article Elon Musk's Big Bet: Tesla to Ramp Up AI Development with Nvidia's Powerful Chips originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Meta Q1 earnings preview: Ad growth and AI are front and center",
        "content": "Meta (META) will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with Wall Street looking for another sizable jump in revenue for the social media giant. Shares of Meta have been on a tear, climbing 116% over the last 12 months and more than45% year to date. That’s far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 45%in the last 12 months and 16%year to date.\n\nWhile part of Meta’s stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company’s stock price truly rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting Meta to report earnings per share of $4.30 on revenue of $36.1 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark another huge jump in EPS and revenue from the same quarter last year when the company reported earnings of $2.20 on revenue of $28.6 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech during the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut JPMorgan Securities analyst Doug Anmuth says Meta’s growth spike could face trouble in the coming months.\n\n“There is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough [comparisons] & perception of lack of new drivers vs. [2023],” Anmuth wrote in a recent earnings note.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt was equally cautious in his own analyst note, saying that he will be primarily focused on “the pace of expected growth in 2Q and 2H24 against more challenging comps.”\n\nDespite that potential headwind, Meta has a number of strengths going its way, including its continued effort in combating TikTok with its Reels platform. The company has also emerged as a potential early winner in the AI space, with the technology set to improve Meta’s overall advertising capabilities.\n\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18. The chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\n\nThe bot, which is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messages, and the Meta.AI website, also can’t be turned off even if users don’t want to use it.\n\nDespite Meta’s increased emphasis on AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t giving up on his quest to bring his vision for the metaverse to life. On Monday, he took a further step toward increasing the number of AR/VR headsets on the market, announcing that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies to use it to build their own devices.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Internet companies are likely to have witnessed robust financial performance as they continue to benefit from the increased demand for solutions that support enterprises’ digital transformation initiatives. These companies are also gaining from the solid demand for digital offerings, as well as the increasing importance of video content and cloud-based applications.\n\nFor internet software solution providers, growth prospects are alluring, primarily owing to the rapid adoption of software-as-a-service (SaaS), which offers a flexible and cost-effective delivery method of applications. It also cuts down on the deployment time compared to legacy systems. Moreover, SaaS attempts to deliver applications to any user, anywhere, anytime and on any device.\n\nThe industry has been gaining from the increasing need for hybrid operating environments in working, learning and diagnosis software, as well as cybersecurity applications. The increasing deployment of AI and generative AI is driving prospects.\n\nOn the other hand, internet content providers are expanding their presence across social media, display and connected TV and search to drive top-line growth.\n\nOutstanding penetration of mobile devices among users makes sense for businesses to invest heavily in web-based infrastructure, video content, applications and security software. Moreover, the pay-as-you-go model helps internet companies scale their offerings per the needs of different users. The subscription-based business model ensures recurring revenues for the industry participants.\n\nInternet companies are a crucial component of the broader technology sector. Per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview article, the total earnings of technology companies for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up 19.4% from the same period last year on 8.3% higher revenues.\n\nAmid the current scenario, investors interested in the internet software industry are eagerly awaiting the earnings releases of players like Opera Limited OPRA, Snap Inc.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - German email service Tuta Mail has complained to European Union tech regulators about what it described as a sudden drop in Google search results on the day the bloc's new tech rules kicked in.\n\nThe European Commission last month launched investigations into Alphabet unit Google, Apple and Meta Platforms over potential breaches of the new Digital Markets Act (DMA), with Google's case partly focused on whether search results discriminate against third-party services.\n\nTuta Mail, which says it is the second-largest encrypted email service in the world with more than 10 million users, filed a complaint to the DMA taskforce on Tuesday.\n\n\"At the beginning of March 2024 Google suddenly stopped displaying our website for thousands of keywords, limiting search traffic to our site in large part to so-called 'branded traffic' only,\" the company said in its complaint seen by Reuters.\n\n\"This means people were no longer finding our encrypted email provider when searching for 'encrypted email', but only when explicitly searching for 'Tuta' or 'Tutanota',\" it said.\n\nTuta Mail CEO Matthias Pfau said he does not understand why his company's ranking fell on the day the DMA became active.\n\n\"Obviously Google changed something in its search algorithms, but we do not know what they changed or why,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\"We have tried to get in contact with Google to discuss this issue, but have received radio silence.\"\n\nGoogle said it does not unfairly promote its own products. Tech experts said websites can lose Google ranking due to algorithm changes.\n\n\"Search ranking updates absolutely do not aim to preference Google products, or any other particular website. The email provider in question is easily accessible globally on Search,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"We appreciate the feedback and will look into how we can ensure Search continues to return the most helpful, relevant results.\"\n\nThe Commission declined to provide details.\n\n\"The Commission monitors compliance of gatekeepers with obligations, including in the context of on-going proceedings. We cannot comment on specific concerns being raised with us,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nPfau said the impact on Tuta Mail has been dramatic.\n\n\"After removing most branded keywords, we see that our total impressions per month (30 days) dropped by 88.47%. Google took away about 90% of our visibility online,\" he said.\n\n\"We want the DMA taskforce to include our data in their investigation on whether Google is complying with the DMA,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DMA obliges Big Tech to give rivals and users more choice, such as by allowing competing services to function with theirs while a list of prohibitions means they can't treat their services more favourably in ranking than rivals.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft's AI lead puts Amazon cloud dominance on watch",
        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Upcoming quarterly reports from U.S. tech giants may show Microsoft is closing the gap on cloud-computing market leader Amazon.com as more businesses switch to its services, attracted by a clutch of generative AI features that are powered by OpenAI's technology.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant has beaten rivals Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet to the market with AI services including the Copilot, a set of genAI tools that work in Microsoft's business apps, that was rolled out in November for $30 a month.\n\nIts earnings on Thursday will be an indicator of AI adoption and could influence the movement of technology stocks as a rally in the sector eases this month amid worries that interest rates in the U.S. could stay high for longer.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft - which overtook Apple as the world's most valuable firm earlier this year - to report that the billions of dollars it has invested in generative AI were attracting clients to its Azure cloud-computing service.\n\n\"Azure is benefiting from a halo effect around Microsoft's AI strategy,\" said RBC Capital Markets Rishi Jaluria, who expects Microsoft to take Amazon's market share.\n\nJaluria added that cloud providers should broadly benefit from signs of stabilization in technology spending, which has been pressured by high-interest rates and economic uncertainty.\n\nIn the first three months of 2024, Microsoft's revenue is expected to have grown 15% and Alphabet's 12.6% - their second-highest rate in nearly two years. Amazon's revenue could rise 11.9%, its worst in three quarters.\n\nAzure, part of the Intelligent cloud unit at Microsoft, is expected to have grown 28.9% in the January-to-March period, according to estimates from Visible Alpha.\n\nThat compares with estimated growth of 14.9% for Amazon Web Service and 25% for Google Cloud, the third-largest cloud provider, according to LSEG data. Google-parent Alphabet reports earnings on Thursday and Amazon on April 30.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino estimated that up to 8 percentage points of Azure's growth could come from AI services.\n\nStill, much of the boost from AI is expected to be realized from next year, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating a $5 billion revenue contribution from Copilot in Microsoft's fiscal 2025, which would start in July.\n\n\"Broader elements of generative AI story (like 365 Copilot) likely need more time to develop and work through enterprise purchasing cycles,\" Morgan Stanley said earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGLE AI GAINS TO TAKE LONGER\n\nWhile Alphabet shares have gained over 13% so far this year and recently scaled a record high on optimism over its AI efforts including the Gemini models, several analysts said the company was not rushing to monetize the technology and that it may take longer for Google Cloud to benefit from AI integration.\n\nGoogle offers a slew of AI features within Workspace productivity apps, which are powered by its large language model Gemini, for up to $30 per user per month. Earlier this month, it announced two $10 add-on packages for AI meeting notes and summaries, and for added security features.\n\n\"Our checks at Google Cloud Next conference showed high interest levels and abundant innovation, but no rush to turn AI pilots into production apps,\" said analysts at Jefferies, who see a more meaningful boost in 2025.\n\nAmazon has not announced any major AI moves but is weaving the technology into AWS on the back of its $4 billion investment in OpenAI-competitor Anthropic.\n\n\"Microsoft has gained a lot of ground last year based on its AI prominence, but AWS is still a much bigger business and we expect Amazon to catch up to those capabilities over the next couple of years,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Beyond \"Big Six:\" Why Choose Non-Cyclical Sector ETFs?",
        "content": "UBS Global Research has revised its outlook for the \"Big Six\" tech companies — Apple, Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia — from \"Overweight\" to \"Neutral,\" according to a recent statement by Jonathan Golub, the chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS Investment Bank, according to a source.\n\nIn his explanation, Golub said that the downgrade is not based on rich valuations or concerns about the sustainability and momentum of the AI technology. Instead, he pointed out tough comps compared to the pandemic period and cyclical pressures as the headwinds. Golub highlighted that the rapid earnings growth recorded by these tech giants over the past year is now ebbing.\n\nWill Easy Comps Faced by Big Tech Go Away in 2025?\n\nUBS indicated that the pandemic initially triggered increased demand for PCs, online shopping and gaming, thus helping those tech stocks’ earnings. A reduction in costs and easy comparisons boosted these companies’ profits, which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2023. But this jump will be followed by a decline in earnings as the economy gradually gains momentum.\n\nGolub also mentioned that the current analysis does not overlook the influence of AI, cloud computing, or bitcoin mining on tech earnings. The research division of UBS predicts a decline in these companies' EPS growth to 16% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 42% in the corresponding period of this year. UBS expects earnings to normalize going forward.\n\nLet’s discuss some examples:\n\nNvidia’s expected sales growth is 17.94% for 2025 versus 74.07% for 2024. Its 2025 expected earnings growth is 13.88% versus 2024’s expectation of 84.72%.\n\nMeta’s expected sales growth is 12.79% for 2025 versus 18.19% for 2024. Its 2025 expected earnings growth is 15.18% versus 2024’s expectation of 35.71%.\n\nAlphabet’s expected sales growth is 11.07% for 2025 versus 13.18% for 2024. Its 2025 expected earnings growth is 14.58% versus 2024’s expectation of 16.90%.\n\nAmazon’s expected sales growth is 11.59% for 2025 versus 11.61% for 2024. Its 2025 expected earnings growth is 30.36% versus 2024’s expectation of 41.38%.\n\nTime for Non-Cyclical ETFs?\n\nAccording to UBS, EPS growth for non-tech companies is expected to surpass that of the Big Six over the next year, as these firms were less affected by the pandemic-induced boom.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also likely to start cutting rates in late 2024 due to the likelihood of cooling inflation. The U.S. economy is showing signs of resilience.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis perspective has bolstered investor confidence, leading to increased investments in sectors like financials and industrials. These areas are deemed safe havens amid the likely Fed rate cuts. Other sectors like consumer staples, utilities and healthcare also appear to be safe bets.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few safe sector ETFs like Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV, Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLI, Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP and iShares U.S. Utilities ETF IDU.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft earnings will be all about AI and whether one of them deserves to be  on the ‘wall of worry’",
        "content": "Since the blockbuster debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022, the topic of AI has dominated the earnings calls of many tech companies. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have mentioned the acronym nearly 200 times in each earnings cycle since, including during the first earnings week this year in January and February.\n\nAnalysts expect AI to be the central theme yet again during earnings calls for the first three months of this year, with Meta reporting on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet on Thursday. But the talk from executives has shifted from “what AI can do?” to “what AI is doing?,” and all three of this week’s Big Tech companies will have a different answer.\n\nFor Microsoft, cloud computing platform Azure is the star of its AI portfolio, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citi. Launched more than a decade ago, Azure now offers a suite of AI tools to businesses including a service that builds custom generative AI apps from existing models. Azure is “one of the best-positioned AI players” in the market and the “main lever” for Microsoft to make money on generative AI right now, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note to investors. That confidence partly comes from Microsoft not having to drastically change how it makes money to drive additional revenue from AI, they wrote.\n\nIn contrast, most of Google’s revenue comes from search and related services, which AI from other companies could eventually replace. Google could cannibalize its search business by building a rival AI one, but that would leave it in a precarious position.\n\nAzure’s business grew 30% year-over-year for the quarter ending December 31, with six points of that growth coming directly from the demand by its customers for AI-related products, CFO Amy Hood said during the company’s earnings call. Expect an additional one to two percentage points of growth from AI services for the first three months of 2024, Citi analysts said in an April 18 report. Microsoft also has other budding AI businesses that the analysts say will contribute meaningfully to revenue next year—namely, the company’s virtual assistant, Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are generally less confident in Google’s business than in Microsoft’s, with Goldman analysts calling its parent’s stock a “wall of worry.” In addition to questioning the growth of  Google’s search business in an AI future, investors worry about the company’s operating margins and the impact of potential regulation. Investors will also have “a heightened degree of concern” about how much Google is spending on AI over the coming earnings seasons, Goldman’s analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Google is a leader in the AI cloud world, which includes many of the services it offers to other businesses, Goldman analysts said in an April 15 report. At Google’s Cloud Next event earlier this month, the company announced expanded access to large language model Gemini and an AI-powered coding assistant.\n\nWhile Meta offers an AI assistant and large language model similar to Microsoft’s and Google’s—including its new Llama 3 model introduced last week, which is free for research and commercial use—that’s not what analysts have their eyes on. In notes from Goldman, Citi, and Bank of America, analysts put much more emphasis on how Meta is using AI to improve its social media algorithms.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, makes most of its money from advertising. The more time users spend scrolling through their feeds, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta generates. In recent months, the company has been working on rebuilding its model for recommending videos to Facebook users, with the help of AI. If effective, the tweak could keep users on Meta’s platforms for longer. When tested on Facebook Reels last year, the new AI-powered technology contributed to “an 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,” Facebook head Tom Alison said at a tech conference last month.\n\nIt is still early for these tools, Bank of America analysts said in an April 19 note, but that means investors could enjoy some “positive product surprises” and revenue growth this year. And with a potential U.S. ban on TikTok, a major competitor, Meta's business is looking well positioned at the moment, they said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Selling",
        "content": "Within the last month, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh highs. While there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors and industries, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been widely credited with lifting these major stock indexes to record levels.\n\nPut simply, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded businesses in the country. These seven juggernauts are (listed in descending order by market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll seven of these companies have crushed the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade. This outperformance is a big reason why investors -- and members of Congress -- have flocked to these businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (and members of Congress) have historically flocked to the Magnificent Seven\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven are leaders or critical players in their respective industries:\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the undisputed leader in global desktop operating systems, while Azure is No. 2 in worldwide cloud infrastructure service spend. Apple's iPhone accounts for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share. Alphabet's Google was responsible for a 91% share of global internet search in March, while wholly owned streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) make up a 90% (or greater) share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is No. 1 globally in online retail market share. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services is the worldwide No. 1 in cloud infrastructure service spend. Meta Platforms owns the most sought-after social media real estate, with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and its other apps collectively attracting almost 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs), and is the only pure-play EV maker to have achieved recurring profits.\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive advantages, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales shows that select lawmakers on Capitol Hill have sent three Magnificent Seven stocks to the chopping block.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 Congress is selling: Nvidia\n\nAlthough Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband have made a small fortune purchasing call options in the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, when it comes to the purchasing and selling of common shares, members of Congress were decidedly sellers of Nvidia stock in 2023. Collectively, $1.76 million shares were sold by lawmakers last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest seller of all, according to data from Capitol Trades, has been House Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA). Between May 5, 2023 and Aug. 14, 2023, five sell orders were executed for Meuser, ranging from just $1,000 to $15,000, up to a sell order of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are three key reasons shares of Nvidia may be headed notably lower.\n\nTo start with, every next-big-thing investment trend since the advent of the internet 30 years ago has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and adoption of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nSecondly, Nvidia has the potential to cannibalize its own pricing power in the coming quarters. The scarcity of its in-demand GPUs drove the price of its A100 and H100 chips into the stratosphere last year. As Nvidia brings more production to market, and new competitors enter the space, GPU scarcity will decline. In turn, Nvidia's gross margin should retrace.\n\nThe third issue, which I believe is Nvidia's biggest hurdle, is that its top four customers (Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet) are all developing in-house GPUs of their own. These Magnificent Seven components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales, and we're probably witnessing a peak in orders from these industry titans. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 Congress is selling: Microsoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress have been steady sellers of is the largest publicly traded company, Microsoft. Though Microsoft is listed on Unusual Whales' heatmap as one of the most-purchased stocks in 2023 ($1.97 million shares bought by lawmakers), members of Congress collectively sold $11.61 million shares. That's a net of $9.64 million worth of Microsoft shares that were sold last year.\n\nWhereas Nvidia had one notable seller, a number of lawmakers couldn't stop selling shares of Microsoft:\n\nHouse Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) dumped between $1 million and $5 million in shares on Jan. 4, 2023. House Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) sold between $250,000 and $500,000 in shares on both March 1, 2023 and Aug. 30, 2023. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) shed $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Microsoft stock on June 20, 2023. House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) sold multiple rounds of Microsoft stock that commonly ranged between five-and-six figures throughout 2023.\n\nThe likeliest reason for this selling is simple profit-taking. Shares of the company gained 57% last year, with the company's investments in AI fueling its ascent.\n\nAnother reason lawmakers may have headed for the exit is Microsoft's valuation. Although Microsoft is an absolute cash cow, it ended April 19 at a multiple of nearly 32 times forward-year earnings. For some context, this is about a 10% premium to Microsoft's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, members of Congress might be concerned about a bubble brewing in the AI space. Microsoft has aggressively invested in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has been incorporating generative AI solutions into Azure. If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, some of Microsoft's valuation premium may be wiped away.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock No. 3 Congress is selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress can't stop selling is social media maven Meta Platforms. Though Meta doesn't appear on Unusual Whales' heatmap of congressional buying activity, it was one of the most-actively sold communication services providers in 2023, with aggregate selling of $2.6 million.\n\nThe culprit for the lion's share of this selling activity in Meta is Michael McCaul, Congress' second most-active stock trader (1,826 trades completed in 2023). In addition to dumping shares of Microsoft on numerous occasions, McCaul sold shares of Meta 16 times last year, based on data provided by Capitol Trades.\n\nAs with Nvidia and Microsoft, profit-taking is a logical reason why lawmakers headed for the exit in 2023. Meta was one of the top-performing megacap stocks last year, with its AI ties clearly providing a boost.\n\nAnother catalyst that may have encouraged members of Congress to pare down their stakes in Meta is the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession. Select predictive indicators and money-based metrics suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy may not be far off. Meta generated close to 98% of its revenue from advertising in 2023, and businesses aren't shy about reducing their ad spending when trouble arises. Although recessions are short-lived, they could hit Meta harder than other Magnificent Seven components.\n\nThe final factor that may be behind Congress' selling of Meta stock is the increasingly competitive social media landscape. The continued popularity of TikTok serves as formidable competition and could result in weaker ad-pricing power for Facebook, the top social media platform in the world.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe McCaul has made a big mistake parting with his shares of Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Outside of Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META, investors are largely antcipating quarterly results from magnificent seven players Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT this week as well.\n\nWith Alphabet and Microsoft’s quarterly reports set for Thursday, April 25, let's see which big tech stock is more attractive at the moment.\n\nQuarterly Expectations\n\nAlphabet’s Q1 earnings are expected to increase 27% to $1.49 per share versus $1.17 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, the search engine leaders' Q1 sales are projected to be up 14% to $66.02 billion. Notably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for four straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 7.22%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs for Microsoft, the software titan has surpassed EPS estimates for six consecutive quarters and posted an average earnings surprise of 8.82% in its last four quarterly reports. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for its current fiscal third quarter which would reflect a 14% increase from a year ago. Plus, Microsoft’s Q3 sales are projected to rise 15% to $60.63 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPerformance & Valuation Comparison\n\nCorrelating with their expansive growth trajectories, Alphabet’s stock has risen +13% year to date with Microsoft shares up +8% to both outperform the S&P 500’s +5% and the Nasdaq’s +4%. Even better, GOOGL and MSFT have now soared over +40% in the last year which has also topped the strong performances of the broader indexes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt their current levels, Alphabet is more appealing in terms of P/E valuation and trades at a 23X forward earnings multiple which is near the S&P 500’s 20.9X with Microsoft at 34.5X. It’s also noteworthy that GOOGL still trades at a discount to its decade-long median of 26.1X whereas MSFT trades above its median and closer to its high of 37.4X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nOver the last 60 days, earnings estimate revisions for Q1 (Current Qtr) and Alphabet’s FY24 have remained unchanged with FY25 EPS estimates slightly higher. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn contrast, earnings estimates for Microsoft’s current quarer and FY24 have slightly decreased in the last two months while FY25 EPS estimates have remained unchanged. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nWhile both of these tech giants are expecting double-digit EPS growth in FY24 and FY25, Alphabet currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with Microsoft landing a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is largely attributed to the trend of earnings estimate revisions which has remained favorable for Alphabet along with the company’s P/E valuation whereas Microsoft trades at a bit of a premium to its big tech peer and FY24 EPS estimates have dipped.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI remain major positives.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has been consistently witnessing strong revenue growth, generated by the underlined segment, which derives revenues from fees collected for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools.\r\n\r\nRevenues from the segment were $9.19 billion in fourth-quarter 2023. The figure accounted for 10.6% of the total revenues and exhibited year-over-year growth of 25.7%.\r\n\r\nFor first-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $9.25 billion, suggesting growth of 24.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to know how Alphabet’s overall first-quarter performance is likely to have been.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

The growing momentum of its most advanced and powerful large language model namely Gemini, is likely to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of generative AI-powered Workspace tools is likely to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nStrength in Google’s Kubernetes offerings is anticipated to have continued driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nGOOGL’s efforts in integrating data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform are expected to have bolstered its prospects in the data cloud market in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company’s amplifying focus on providing a secure cloud infrastructure, owing to its growing cybersecurity efforts, is expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nAll these endeavors are likely to have contributed well to the first-quarter performance of Google Cloud.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Dell Technologies DELL and Badger Meter BMI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "Google fired at least 20 additional workers after last week's Gaza protest, group says",
        "content": "Google fired additional workers this week, after it initially terminated 28 people who it said participated in recent protests against the company's work in Israel.\n\nThe total number of employees terminated in the wake of the protests — which took place inside Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, Calif. — has grown to more than 50 people, with more than 20 people ousted on Monday night, according to the No Tech for Apartheid Campaign, the advocacy group that organized the sit-ins.\n\nGoogle, in a statement, confirmed that the company had cut additional workers as a result of its investigation into the protests, but did not say how many. The spokesperson said it took more time to identify some of the participants because their faces were concealed by masks and they weren't wearing their employee badges.\n\n“Our investigation into these events is now concluded, and we have terminated the employment of additional employees who were found to have been directly involved in disruptive activity,\" the company said. \"To reiterate, every single one of those whose employment was terminated was personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings. We carefully confirmed and reconfirmed this.”\n\nThe protest group has previously decried the firings and alleged that some of the terminated protesters didn't participate directly in the events, a contention that Google vigorously disputed.\n\n\"Google is throwing a tantrum because the company’s executives are embarrassed about the strength workers showed at last Tuesday’s historic sit-ins, as well as their botched response to them,\" No Tech for Apartheid Campaign said in a statement. \"Now, the corporation is lashing out at any worker that was physically in the vicinity of the protest — including those who were not at all involved in the campaign.\"\n\nOn April 16, the campaign held rallies outside of Google offices. Dozens of employees sat for hours in sit-ins the New York City and Sunnyvale locations, and nine people were arrested for trespassing.\n\nThe campaign is pushing for the company to drop its cloud computing contract with the Israeli government and military, called Project Nimbus. The group said that it will continue to demand that Google drop Project Nimbus, protect Palestinian, Arab and Muslim employees and reinstate the workers who were terminated.\n\nRead more:Google employees stage sit-ins to protest company's contract with Israel\n\nAfter the protests and sit-ins, Google last week said it had fired the first 28 employees for violating company policy governing employee conduct and harassment.\n\nIn a blog post last week, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai wrote that while it is important to preserve the company's culture of open discussion, Google must maintain a professional workplace.\n\n\"[O]ur policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics,\" Pichai wrote.\n\nRead more:A worker objected to Google's Israel military contract.

        "title": "Ex-Googler and Palestinian-American fired for opposing Project Nimbus speaks out: ‘This was not my idea of what the American workplace should be’",
        "content": "The golden age for tech workers, which started in 2010, is seemingly over—and bringing your sandals, cargo pants, and personal beliefs to work is no longer a given.\n\nJust last week, Alphabet’s Google—once known for its open culture—fired 28 workers, nine of which were arrested for engaging in a sit-in to protest a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon for the Israeli government. Known as “Project Nimbus,” the deal to provide AI and cloud services to Israel has become increasingly polarizing as its aggression in Gaza has escalated to what one UN expert denounced as genocide.\n\nSince then, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has held fast in his steering Google into a different and perhaps less collaborative track. Pichai penned a blog post on April 18 wherein he warned staff not to “use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.”\n\nSeveral fired Google employees spoke at a press conference Monday about their experiences. Ex-employees shared their feelings of dejection over this directive to work on a project that they did not believe to be ethical, and expressed they’d keep fighting until Project Nimbus is stopped. One such former employee, who remained anonymous to protect his identity while looking for new jobs, opened up about how this changed his views of what America actually values as a nation. As a Palestinian-American with family in Gaza, Oreo (an anonymous name), explains how the shakedown and his subsequent firing changed his idea of inclusivity in the workplace.\n\n“I've just come to learn that our opinions at the workplace can come back and hurt us, despite the mantras that we hear like, ‘Bring your whole self to work,’ and ‘Company X or Company Y values debate and diversity,’” he said.\n\nOreo claimed he never participated in the sit-ins that were at issue in the firings. He said he briefly went into the building to meet the protestors and take a group photo and he “left shortly after and never went back to the building.” Oreo added that he never had an issue with security. He was “chanting peacefully” and holding a sign by a bush that was not near the walkways or offices where the actual protests took place, he said. Even so, Oreo described receiving an automated email indicating his termination without any questions or avenue to explain his case.\n\n“I’m not naive,” said Oreo, noting he’s aware businesses need to be productive and show value to shareholders over their workforce at times. That’s why he was so careful, he added, explaining he doesn't feel entitled to more than being treated “fairly and within the bounds of the law.”“It was totally okay if Google did not listen to me, or take action. I wish they did, but I didn't expect them to. But to fire me for having a dissenting opinion was not my idea of what the American workplace should be, let alone what the company of ‘Do no evil’ should be,” Oreo said, referring to the company’s former motto.\n\nStory continues\n\nA new statement from the organizer of protests, No Tech for Apartheid, claims an additional 20 Google employees have been fired, which brings the total of Google workers that have been let go to around 50.\n\n“We continued our investigation into the physical disruption inside our buildings on April 16, looking at additional details provided by coworkers who were physically disrupted, as well as those employees who took longer to identify because their identity was partly concealed–like by wearing a mask without their badge–while engaged in the disruption,” said a Google spokesperson. Explaining that the case is now closed, the spokesperson claims that company “carefully confirmed and reconfirmed” that every person fired was “personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings.”\n\nGoogle referred Fortune to its previous statements, claiming “the protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don’t work at Google,” and that the participants disrupted other employees’ work. The company also claims the Nimbus project isn’t “directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” No Tech for Apartheid has refuted these statements.\n\nNevertheless, the rug was seemingly pulled out from some employees. Oreo describes feeling as if Google led him to believe it was a company that had a culture of open dialogue. “I guess I was encouraged to express my opinion at Google, after seeing many executives at Google, including Sundar himself, passionately express their opinion and emotions at work on October 7,” he said. “As they should, because peaceful expression of opinion is at the essence of what America stands for, and what Google promised it would stand for.\"\n\nOreo expressed this perceived openness led him to feel safer about speaking out and says he “followed their lead,” adding he hopes this is an exception to what he and his fellow Americans should expect from the company. He also explained how the firings at Google affected not just his employment status, but his idea of America as a nation.\n\n“This incident hit me harder than most,” he said, explaining that as a Middle-Eastern immigrant, he  “always aspired, even as a child, to escape the tyranny and the one-man shows of the Middle East and to start a life in the United States, the ultimate haven for those who want to work hard and seek freedom and equality.”\n\n“But I was in for a reality check,” he says.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google fired at least 20 more workers in the aftermath of protests over technology the company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war, bringing the total number of terminated staff to more than 50, a group representing the workers said.\n\nIt's the latest sign of internal turmoil at the tech giant centered on “Project Nimbus,” a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.\n\nWorkers held sit-in protests last week at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California. The company responded by calling the police, who made arrests.\n\nThe group organizing the protests, No Tech For Apartheid, said the company fired 30 workers last week — higher than the initial 28 they had announced.\n\nThen, on Tuesday night, Google fired “over 20” more staffers, “including non-participating bystanders during last week’s protests,” said Jane Chung, a spokeswoman for No Tech For Apartheid, without providing a more specific number.\n\n“Google’s aims are clear: the corporation is attempting to quash dissent, silence its workers, and reassert its power over them,” Chung said in a press release. “In its attempts to do so, Google has decided to unceremoniously, and without due process, upend the livelihoods of over 50 of its own workers.”\n\nGoogle said it fired the additional workers after its investigation gathered details from coworkers who were “physically disrupted” and it identified employees who used masks and didn't carry their staff badges to hide their identities. It didn't specify how many were fired.\n\nThe company disputed the group's claims, saying that it carefully confirmed that “every single one of those whose employment was terminated was personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings.”\n\nThe Mountain View, California, company had previously signaled that more people could be fired, with CEO Sundar Pichai indicati ng in a blog post that employees would be on a short leash as the company intensifies its efforts to improve its AI technology.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s social platform X is launching a TV app, pushing deeper into video and entertainment content as it takes on the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Stock in ‘No Man’s Land’ After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings Ray Dalio’s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing Billionaire Pinaults Fight to Pull Gucci Off the Discount Rack ‘Mag Seven’ Roar as Tesla Jumps in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken\n\nX didn’t confirm a date for the platform’s release but said it would be “coming soon to most smart TVs.” Additionally, the company touted the ability to cast video from smartphones to bigger TV screens, through the app — a move that Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. have also made in recent months to allow use of their own operating systems to be more compatible with sharing video content to other devices.\n\nAs part of that video push, X announced several high-profile partnerships earlier this year to get more professionally produced video onto the service. One of those deals, an arrangement with former CNN anchor Don Lemon for an exclusive show, fell apart after Lemon interviewed Musk on camera.\n\n“We do plan to monetize it, and will discuss different forms of partnerships — and that may include ads,” X said in a separate memo to potential customers and partners they’re targeting.\n\nMusk has been pushing X, formerly known as Twitter, to move beyond a text and image-based social platform to more of a so-called “everything app.” That’s been driven, in part, by advertiser flight and the need to find new streams of revenue and differentiate the platform. He’s previously identified YouTube and Microsoft Corp.’s professional network LinkedIn as targets for X.\n\nIn the last 30 days, users have watched 23 billion minutes worth of video on X, the company said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets Big Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner China’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft’s MSFT third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, scheduled to be reported on Apr 25, are likely to be driven by the consistent growth in its cloud platform, Azure.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues (Azure falls under the segment) between $26 billion and $26.3 billion.\r\n\r\nOur model estimate for Intelligent Cloud revenues is currently pegged at $26.01 billion, indicating 17.8% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nAzure's Continued Growth to Propel MSFT's Top Line in Q3\n\nMicrosoft is witnessing robust demand for its cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions. This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 30% (up 28% at cc), including roughly 6 points from AI services, which was higher than the previous quarter's 29% (28% at cc). In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth at cc to remain stable in the fiscal third quarter, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services. Additionally, the company's per-user business is expected to have benefited from the momentum in the Microsoft 365 suite.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, MSFT announced the expansion of its collaboration with Oracle ORCL to meet growing customer demand for Oracle Database@Azure with five more regions, which brings the total planned multi-cloud availability footprint to 15 regions globally.\r\n\r\nAzure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened the tech giant's competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon’s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (14% of sales) rose 13% year over year to $24.2 billion, with operating income of $7.2 billion, up 37.7% year over year. The expansion of AWS' portfolio has been helping Amazon maintain its dominance in the cloud domain by gaining more customers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet's Google Cloud revenues rose 25.7% year over year to $9.19 billion, accounting for 10.6% of the quarter’s total revenues. Google Cloud reported operating income of $864 million against a loss of $186 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAzure AI Gives MSFT Competitive Edge in Generative AI Market\n\nMicrosoft has tightly integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 language model into its Bing search engine and Edge browser, delivering a ChatGPT-like experience to users. The Azure OpenAI Service enables developers to easily incorporate large language models and generative AI into applications across various use cases.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal second quarter, MSFT witnessed solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers. More than one-third of customers are new to Azure over the past 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe company has launched copilot templates that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and streamline store operations using generative AI. Microsoft and OpenAI are collaborating on an advanced data center project to meet the immense computational demands of complex generative AI tasks.\r\n\r\nDespite these cutting-edge AI moves, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 10% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 11.1% growth amid intensifying competition from Amazon and Alphabet as they are all making aggressive moves to expand their generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAWS is leveraging AMZN’s Bedrock, which provides access to high-performance foundation models from AI firms through an API. Alphabet’s Google has been swiftly iterating its language models, releasing the Multitask Unified Model and Pathways Language Model to bolster its search capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nThe launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 \"Magnificent 7\" Stocks Ready to Report Earnings. Here's What to Expect\n\nAmid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\n\nNVIDIA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of NVIDIA fell 13.6% last week and are down about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion.\n\nApple and Microsoft lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms and Alphabet erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\n\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. First-quarter earnings for Magnificent Seven are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues. This would follow the 51.2% earnings growth for the group in the fourth quarter on 15% higher revenues.\n\nProfits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500's 2.4% year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nHere, we discuss three companies from the Magnificent Seven — Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — that are set to release earnings this week. Meta Platforms will report on Apr 24, while Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to release their results on Apr 25.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 63.6%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%). Shares of META have surged about 22% over the past three months.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -3.36% and a Zacks Rank #3. Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 8.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 14.69% and modest revenue growth of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 34%) and has gained 0.6% over the past three months.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company's earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 7.22%. Earnings are expected to increase 27.4%, while revenues are expected to grow 13.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 18%) and has climbed 5.5% in the past three months.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nAre These Mag 7 Members Buys Ahead of Earnings?\n\nWe have entered the heart of the 2024 Q1 earnings cycle with a notably stacked earnings schedule on deck for this week. The period has primarily been positive so far, with the big banks' results not causing any spooks.\n\nAnd concerning this week's busy docket, two 'Mag 7' members – Alphabet and MetaPlatforms – are scheduled to unveil quarterly results.\n\nAlphabet will report after the market close on April 25th, whereas Meta will report on April 24th after the market close. Shares of each have been considerably strong in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 handily.\n\nAdvertising revenue is a significant chunk of each company's business and will undoubtedly be a focal point in the releases. But how does everything stack up heading into their quarterly releases? Let's take a closer look at what's expected.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe outlook for Meta's upcoming release has turned visibly bright, with the $4.32 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 20% since the end of January and suggesting 63% year-over-year growth. Favorable cost-cutting measures have aided the company's profitability picture in a big way.\n\nConcerning Advertising revenue, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $35.6 billion, suggesting a sizable 27% growth rate from the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our expectations for this metric as of late, with the most recent beat totaling $827 million.\n\nDespite their strong run, shares aren't valuation stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 22.8X nearly in line with the 21.6X five-year median and well beneath highs of 31.5X in 2020. In addition, the current PEG ratio of 1.2X reflects that investors aren't overpaying for the forecasted growth.\n\nShares have had a tough showing over the last month, losing roughly 5% alongside the S&P 500's 4% decline. Further weakness post-earnings could be a great purchase point for investors if the company's guidance is solid, which will keep analysts' revisions positive.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAlphabet\n\nAnalysts haven't shown as much positivity for Alphabet's upcoming release compared to META, with the $1.49 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up a modest 2% since the end of January. The company's forecasted growth remains strong, expected to post 28% earnings growth on nearly 14% higher sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $60.1 billion, 10% higher than the year-ago mark of $54.5 billion. The company fell short of the consensus estimate in its latest release by $105 million, snapping a previous streak of positive surprises on the metric.\n\nLike META, shares aren't overly stretched concerning valuation, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple nearly in line with the five-year median and well beneath highs of 32.6X in 2021. The PEG ratio works out to 1.4X, again in line with the five-year median and beneath five-year highs of 1.9X.\n\nShares have displayed relative strength over the last month, gaining 4% in value compared to the S&P 500's 4% decline. Favorable commentary from the release concerning AI developments and advertising trends can help keep the stock's momentum positive, though it is critical to follow analysts' revisions post-earnings.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with a wide variety of companies scheduled to report quarterly results.\n\nBoth Alphabet and Meta have continued their momentum in 2024, outperforming handily. Analysts have been positive for both companies' quarterly releases, though positive revisions are much more pronounced within META.\n\nPost-earnings weakness could be prevalent given the recent strong runs, though both companies' fundamentals continue to make them an attractive long-term play.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "ACM Research and J.B. Hunt have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 23, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares ACM Research ACMR as the Bull of the Day and J.B. Hunt Transport Services JBHT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nACM Research is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops, manufactures, and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process and yield for integrated chips.\n\nThe demand for artificial intelligence and the chips that fuel AI have brought demand for ACM's tools. This has helped the company post a long streak of earnings beats, including a 330% EPS beat last quarter.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on the recent tech sell-off so the question for investors is if the current dip presents an opportunity.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nACM Research is headquartered in Fremont, CA, and employs over 1,500.\n\nThe stock has Zacks Style Scores of \"D\" in Growth, Momentum, and Value.\n\nThe company was founded in 1998, has a market cap of $1.4 billion, and a Forward PE of 15. ACMR pays no dividend.\n\nQ4 Earnings Beat\n\nOn February 28th, ACMR reported a 330% EPS beat and saw revenues up 56% y/y. The company affirmed its FY24 outlook range of $650-725M versus the $707M expected.\n\nManagement cited the strength of ACM's multi-product portfolio and its growing customer base. They added that they have captured market share and made notable strides in penetrating international markets.\n\nThe stock gapped higher and ran the next day posting a 30% gain. Investors took notice of this small semiconductor name but it has since pulled back as the next catalyst approaches.\n\nThe company will release its preliminary revenue range on April 26th before the market opens. It will then release its full results on May 8th.\n\nThat first release will likely give investors the green light to buy the stock again or erase the bull's hopes of getting back to recent highs.\n\nAnalyst Estimates\n\nAll indications are that the quarter will be solid as analysts lifted estimates since earnings.\n\nFor the current quarter, estimates over the last 60 days have gone from $0.19 to $0.36, or 89%.\n\nLooking longer term, the current year shows a 19% jump over that same time frame, moving from $1.36 to $1.62.\n\nSince earnings, the stock has seen multiple upgrades and price target hikes.\n\nROTH MKM reiterated its Buy and lifted its target from $25 to $40.\n\nGoldman Sach also reiterated its Buy and has a $39 target.\n\nBenchmark has raised its target twice since earnings, first going to $35, then later to $38.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Technicals\n\nAt its highest point, ACMR was up 70% in 2024. The recent pullback has not been nice to the bulls and the stock is now up only 25% this year.\n\nWhile the upcoming earnings will likely rejuvenate the momentum or erode more gains, there are some levels to look for either way.\n\nThe $19.25 area is the 200-day MA and would be in line with former resistance in 2023. If earnings were to disappoint, this would be the area to enter for long-term players.\n\n$22.75 is the gap fill and the 61.8% retracement from the February lows to the 2024 highs. This is a good spot to see a relief bounce and a possible support area.\n\nIf the bulls gain back momentum, a move back over the $27 area is a 50-day MA break and a bullish signal. A positive earnings report and a break above $29.50 would give the bulls a 21-day MA break and full control of the momentum.\n\nIf we get an impressive preliminary revenue guide, investors could look for the $38 area down the road.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMore investors are looking for smaller stocks to enter the AI/semi-boom. ACMR is a perfect place to be, but a lot of the short-term price movement will be based on upcoming earnings.\n\nDue to the massive demand, the company likely beats once more, but investors need to decide whether to dip their toes in before the preliminary guide or wait for more certainty.\n\nEither way, this is a stock to watch over the next few weeks and if the company holds the earnings momentum, investors should expect new highs before the end of 2024.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a provider of a broad range of transportation services to a diverse group of customers.\n\nThe stock has drifted sideways over the last few years, but a recent earnings report has JBHT trading at the bottom of its multi-year range.\n\nAfter the sixth straight EPS miss, investors might give up on the name, bringing the stock much lower over the short term.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nJ.B. Hunt was founded in 1961 and is headquartered in Lowell, Arkansas. The company employs over 34,000 people and operates through five segments: Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract Services (DCS), Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), Final Mile Services (FMS), and Truckload (JBT). The JBI segment offers intermodal freight solutions\n\nJBHT is valued at $17 billion and has a Forward PE of 25. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \"B\" in Growth, but \"D\" in Value. The stock pays a dividend of just over 1%.\n\nQ1 Earnings\n\nLast week J.B. Hunt reported a Q1 miss of 20%. Revenues came in at $2.94B versus the $3.12B expected as overall demand for intermodal service offerings was weaker than expected.\n\nWhile intermodal revenue was down 9% from last year, Integrated Capacity Solutions revenue took the biggest year-over-year hit, down 26%.\n\nManagement blamed competition from over-the-road truck options in the eastern network, as well as the company's disciplined approach to the market for the value. Management also cited inflationary cost pressures and said that customers continue to feel pressure in their business.\n\nThis was the sixth straight surprise to the downside for JBHT, but the market has given the stock a break almost every time. However, with analysts dropping numbers aggressively since EPS, will investors finally capitulate?\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nOver the 7 days, earnings estimates have come down across all time frames.\n\nFor the current quarter, analysts have dropped estimates from $1.89 to $1.62, or 14%.\n\nFor the next quarter, estimates have been lowered by 10%.\n\nFor the current year, we see an 11% drop, with estimates falling from $7.61 to $6.76\n\nThe drop in estimates is beginning to look like a larger trend. Looking at a long-term term time frame, we see that next year's estimates have fallen 9% over the last 90 days, going from $9.58 to $8.72.\n\nAnalysts are also lowering price targets. Some more notable names include UBS going from $234 to $211 and Barclays dropping to $170 from $200.\n\nTechnical Take\n\nWhen you look at a chart from 2021, we see a range from $160- 200, with the stock seeing a couple of false breakouts above that $200 figure.\n\n$160 is a big support level long-term, so some investors likely will want to buy the current dip. This level has held up about ten times over the last three years, but if it were to break, we might see some panic selling.\n\nThe stock is trading below all its moving averages and took out 2023 lows. This isn't a positive sign when the overall stock market has rallied significantly. If that $160 level were to break, the $130 level could be in play. This is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from COVID lows to all-time highs. This move would be another 20% lower from here so investors should be patient or simply avoid the stock altogether.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThe trucking industry is going through some hurdles in the current economic environment, with one such hurdle being inflationary pressure. J.B. Hunt is also experiencing competition issues, which is hurting revenues.\n\nUntil the company can manage the issues, investors should look elsewhere.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nShould You Consider Alphabet (GOOGL) Ahead of Q1 Earnings?\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 25.\n\nThe company has been benefiting from growing investments in the generative AI technology, expanding presence in the booming cloud-computing market, increasing efforts to improve search results, solid uptake of Android and deepening focus on the wearables category in the quarter under review.\n\nNevertheless, increasing litigation issues and expenses are likely to have been concerning.\n\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamentals of Alphabet ahead of its first-quarter 2024 results.\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Efforts to Consider\n\nAlphabet's continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are expected to have continued aiding its search revenues in the first quarter.\n\nThe Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well. With the large language model-powered enhanced search results, Google is anticipated to have driven its search momentum in the quarter under review.\n\nLarge language models, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are expected to have continued improving the search results.\n\nGrowing momentum with Bard is anticipated to have contributed well to Search revenues in the first quarter.\n\nImproving features of Google Maps are expected to have benefited the search traffic.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Search & Other revenues is pegged at $44.73 billion, indicating an increase of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nApart from this, Google's growing advertisement offerings, infused with generative AI technology, are expected to have contributed well to its advertising revenues in the first quarter. Solid momentum in the retail vertical is anticipated to have been a plus.\n\nThe consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $60.18 billion, implying growth of 10.3% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.\n\nComing to non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is likely to have been a tailwind. Google's growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.\n\nSolid momentum across YouTubeTV and major updates in YouTube Premium are likely to have been other positives.\n\nThe growing momentum across Android and Pixel devices is expected to have benefited Alphabet's performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe above-mentioned factors are anticipated to have benefited Google's Services segment's performance in the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $69.04 billion, indicating growth of 11.4% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStrength in Cloud & Other Bets to Benefit\n\nAlphabet has been significantly gaining momentum in the highly competitive cloud market for a while on the back of its expanding cloud service portfolio and an increasing number of data centers.\n\nThe solid adoption of Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the Google Cloud segment in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nIts strengthening generative AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google's momentum among cloud customers.\n\nAlphabet's strengthening efforts to bolster its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment in the first quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $384 million, suggesting growth of 33.3% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $66.02 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.7% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.49, indicating 27.3% growth from the previous year's reported figure. The figure has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Alphabet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is the case here, as you will see below.\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nGOOGL carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nHere are some other companies that, too, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the soon-to-be-reported quarterly results.\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +11.66% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon shares have gained 14.9% year to date. AMZN is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 30.\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nMeta shares have gained 36.1% year to date. META is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in April",
        "content": "Even as the S&P 500 notched a new all-time high within the past few weeks, there are still many stocks that look like attractive buys. In the tech world, artificial intelligence (AI) is dominant right now. If a stock has \"AI\" attached to its product or name, then it's likely doing quite well. But that leaves other stocks that have been left behind simply because AI isn't their primary product, or they aren't making as big a deal about it as others.\n\nThat gives investors strong buying opportunities as the stocks don't have a premium price tag. With that in mind, I think there are three great tech stocks that investors should be loading up on before April is over.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made a significant number of investments in the AI realm. While that's a fair point, many investors are overlooking that Alphabet is still primarily an advertising business. In the fourth quarter, advertising revenue comprised 76% of Alphabet's total, making it by far the major part of its business.\n\nAd revenue increased by 11% in Q4, but this is a significant growth acceleration compared to previous quarters, as Alphabet's ad growth rate was 9% in the third quarter and 3% in the second. This indicates that the ad market is recovering from last year's downturn, making it a great time for investors to hop into the stock before significant growth occurs.\n\nAlphabet's stock also doesn't carry a massive premium like some of its peers. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is right around its average over the past five years. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, its forward P/E is quite a bit lower, which indicates there should be some growth ahead. This makes Alphabet a great stock to load up on now as its primary business is starting to hit its stride again.\n\ndLocal\n\ndLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a fintech stock that flies under most investors' radar, which is a shame. dLocal's products allow companies to do business in countries with less developed payment ecosystems, like India, Vietnam, Turkey, Nigeria, or El Salvador. By creating the partnerships necessary within each country with its own unique payment system, it saves its customers from having to develop a unique system for doing business in each country. This makes selling within these emerging markets much easier.\n\nWith customers like Amazon, Spotify, Microsoft, and Shopify among its clients, dLocal's reputation is already established.\n\ndLocal's growth has also been impressive. In Q4, its revenue rose 59% year over year to $188 million on the back of 55% growth in total payment volume to $5.1 billion. It's also already profitable, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $0.10 in the quarter -- good enough for a 15% profit margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith dLocal's stock trading at just 32 times trailing earnings and 26 times forward earnings with its growth rates, it's a strong stock pick at these levels.\n\nProcore\n\nWhile most industries have undergone a digital transformation that uses software to improve the efficiency and communication of all parties, construction hasn't. That's because the internet infrastructure wasn't good enough on job sites to use these programs. With that barrier now mostly out of the way, it opens the door for construction management software like Procore (NYSE: PCOR) to take effect.\n\nProcore's construction management software creates a central source for all construction project members. This allows contractors to pull the latest iterations of drawings from the program, thus helping to avoid potential communication errors or out-of-revision drawings. This makes Procore a no-brainer product to implement for most construction sites, which has been reflected in Procore's growth.\n\nIn Q4, Procore's revenue rose 29% year over year to $260 million. While not profitable from a traditional basis, it produced $41 million in free cash flow, which means Procore could survive without external funding. Management also gave strong growth projections for 2024, as revenue in the first quarter is expected to rise around 23% to 24%, and full-year revenue should increase by 20%. PCOR PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis is healthy growth and exceeds the levels of some AI software companies. Despite that, Procore's stock doesn't fetch a premium valuation. At just under 11 times sales, Procore's stock doesn't tip the scales at over 20 times sales like many AI stocks do.\n\nWith a popular product, a great stock price, and a growing business, Procore looks like a good company to invest in if you want to avoid the AI hype.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimates",
        "content": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe company reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million) compared to a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven driven by share price appreciation during the quarter.\"\n\nThe audio giant also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also noted that Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 6% higher in pre-market trading following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion)— 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nStory continues\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google AI venture to help military with disaster response",
        "content": "An artificial intelligence (AI) venture backed by Google is partnering with the military to use AI in responding to natural disasters.\n\nBellwether, a team that's part of Google parent Alphabet's X innovation hub, announced Wednesday that it's working with the National Guard and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to address inefficiencies in the Guard's disaster response processes. The DIU is tasked with helping the Department of Defense integrate early stage commercial technologies into its operations.\n\nBellwether worked with the National Guard to develop a system that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to quickly analyze aerial imagery of disaster scenes to identify damage to critical infrastructure. That can then inform National Guard teams coordinating the disaster response as they look to deploy resources most effectively after conducting damage assessments.\n\nThe National Guard currently conducts damage assessments manually as humans look over aerial images of a disaster-struck area to compare them against corresponding pictures of those locations to note infrastructure changes caused by the disaster. That process continues as the disaster progresses, and the initial response can be delayed due to the time required to review those details.\n\nAIR FORCE CONFIRMS FIRST SUCCESSFUL AI DOGFIGHT Damage assessments are required before the National Guard can begin coordinating the bulk of its disaster response efforts.\n\n\"Right now, our analysts have to spend time sorting through images to find the ones that cover the areas most affected by natural disasters,\" Col. Brian McGarry – who leads the National Guard's operations, plans and training division – said in a statement.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"They then have to correlate those images to surrounding infrastructure, label all the relevant features, and only then can highlight the significant damage and send it forward to first responder teams.\"\n\n\"Using AI and ML to do the routine tasks of georectification, identification, and labeling will greatly speed up how quickly we can get important information to the folks that need it most,\" McGarry wrote. \"It's all about saving lives in our communities.\"\n\nGOOGLE CONSOLIDATES AI-FOCUSED DEEPMIND, RESEARCH TEAMS Bellwether's AI tool generates a labeled map comparing an area before the disaster with the aftermath to help coordinate the response.\n\nThe Bellwether team said they spent nine months building a prototype that uses AI and machine learning to analyze aerial imagery of an area hit by a disaster in mere seconds, using Google's geospatial assets as a reference to compare what the area looked like before the disaster.\n\nAfter the images of the disaster scene are analyzed, the Bellwether tool produces a labeled map of affected areas that allows the National Guard to quickly determine how to deploy its resources in response to conditions in the disaster-affected area.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There is so much information from so many sources about the Earth out there,\" Sarah Russell, who leads Project Bellwether at X, said in a release. \"Our moonshot is to systematize that information so that disaster response organizations and other entities can use it to make better decisions and plan for the future.\"\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Damage assessments are currently prepared manually through the review and comparison of various images to determine the extent of damage.\n\n\"The DIU supports our mission to build the most effective tools possible as natural disasters continue to occur with worsening severity,\" Russell added. \"In five years, nobody should have to wait to understand the extent of extreme weather damage and the community's most urgent needs. It should be seen as reasonable and expected that we immediately know the state of the most important infrastructure across a landscape, and what to do next.\"\n\nGoogle said Bellwether's results are so encouraging to the DIU that it's partnering with the team on future disaster response efforts. Bellwether will partner with DIU on future disaster response efforts.\n\nGoogle's X innovation hub also noted in a separate post that Bellwether is developing a wildfire prediction tool to calculate fire risk for landscapes and structures up to five years in the future.\n\nThe tool estimates the likelihood of wildfire in a location by analyzing historical data about the environment as well as risk drivers like tree species, wind qualities and the types of infrastructure in the area.\n\nOriginal article source:Google AI venture to help military with disaster response\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 best Evernote alternatives in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Evernote Alternatives in 2024.\n\nWhat's New With Evernote?\n\nEvernote is a leading note-taking application. The platform enables users to take notes, store files, and organize their to-do lists. These notes can then be shared, exported, and tagged. On April 5, Evernote announced 20 improvements to its application. Users can now benefit from slash commands, AI editing tools, collapsible sections, in-app notifications, and arrow ligatures, among other features. The application also integrates with the Outlook Calendar.\n\nOn March 23, Evernote announced the discontinuation of its legacy versions of the application. All users running the legacy version of the application on Windows, Android, and MacOS, will no longer be able to access Evernote. The legacy versions are being discontinued as they have not been maintained ever since Evernote v10 was introduced in 2020. Thus, the legacy version poses a security threat to the company. The discontinuation was enforced on March 26, 2024.\n\nNote Taking Solutions by Tech Giants\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offer note-taking solutions. Let's take a look at their offerings.\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Keep is a free note taking solution. Users can create notes, edit existing notes, develop lists, and draw. Google Keep has a range of themes and colors available for use. Users can also pin important notes and set reminders. Google Keep users may also share editable versions of their notes with others. The application can be integrated with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Assistant. Google Assistant can create notes for a user when ordered by voice. Users with an Android tablet can use Google Keep in dual pane view.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneNote is a digital note taking solution. The solution can be used for free as a mobile and web application. It is a part of the Microsoft 365 Suite. The application allows users to store, organize, and print information. Users can also collaborate with fellow users to create notes. OneNote is synced across all the devices of a user. A single page on Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneNote is an infinite canvas, allowing users to write anywhere on the page and play around.\n\nLike Google Keep, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Notes application allows users to make notes, create lists, insert stickers and emojis, and add screenshots and recordings. Apple Notes also allows users to draw in documents, fill out forms, and sign documents. Users can also use the Notes app to scan documents, save them in the app, and add signatures if needed. Apple Notes can be accessed on the web by signing into Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iCloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nCan Note Taking Startups like Wudpecker AI compete with Tech Giants?\n\nWudpecker AI is a stand-alone note-taking software backed by artificial intelligence. The AI assistant follows instructions and automatically takes human-like notes for meetings. It creates tables, collects discussion insights, and highlights any important decisions taken during the meeting. More than 10,000 teams are using the platform. The platform can also be integrated with other applications including Notion, Slack, and Hubspot. Users can create notes in more than 100 languages. The AI backed platform stores instructions on special words and their spellings. It then stores the information and follows suit for all notes taken in the future.\n\nOn April 11, Wudpecker AI announced the launch of its MacOS native application for bot-less recording. This means that no AI bots will be joining meetings. However, this also means that hosts will have to start recording themselves, and they must also inform participants about the recording. The Windows version will be launched soon. On March 25, Wudpecker AI launched a solution enabling users to personalize their notes. Users can train Wudpecker AI on how they want their notes to be taken. For instance, if a user wants the notes in a table format, the AI will take the instructions into account for all future notes. The Evaluator tool also provides feedback on the given instructions helping users improve their future notes.\n\nNow that we have discussed prominent note-taking apps and platforms, let's discuss the 20 best Evernote alternatives in 2024. You can take a look at the best Asana alternatives and competitors for project management in 2024. 20 Best Evernote Alternatives in 2024\n\n20 Best Evernote Alternatives in 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe employed a consensus methodology and consulted over 10 rankings online to aggregate the 20 best Evernote alternatives in 2024.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in April",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the tech world over the last year, skyrocketing countless stocks. However, AI is by no means a new concept. So you might be asking yourself, why has it suddenly blown up?\n\nWhile computers are excellent at numerical tasks and data processing, they haven't always been capable of natural human capabilities like language, visual processing, and various generative tasks. However, AI bridges that gap, using machine learning to complete tasks that typically require a human.\n\nAs a result, advances in AI can potentially benefit a wide range of markets, including consumer tech, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, education, and more. And with the market and technology still in their infancy, it seems the sky's the limit for AI.\n\nIn fact, the AI sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion. The market's significant potential suggests it's not too late to invest in and profit from the tailwinds of AI long into the future.\n\nSo here are three AI stocks that are screaming buys this April.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIt hasn't been easy to be an Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) investor in recent years, with its stock down 27% since 2022. However, the company has made significant changes to its business model over the last year that could make it an attractive long-term option for investing in AI.\n\nIntel is expanding in the market by launching its new line of Gaudi 3 AI graphics processing units (GPUs). The chips were released earlier this month, and claim to have 50% better inference and 40% better power efficiency than similar offerings from Nvidia.\n\nAdditionally, Intel is using its years of dominance and expertise in central processing units (CPUs) to secure a top spot in AI by expanding the AI capabilities of its processors. AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIt'll take time for Intel to develop its AI business and catch up to rivals like Nvidia and AMD. However, the chart above indicates that Intel is potentially the best-valued AI chip stock. Intel has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) among these companies, making it a relative bargain.\n\nThe company is on an exciting growth path, and too good to pass up right now.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been quieter on the AI front than many of its peers. However, the company is known for taking its time with new technology. Apple isn't necessarily known for pioneering innovations, but for perfecting established technology with its own design language and then rising to dominance in the industry by attracting billions of users.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkets such as Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, and tablets were each led by different companies before Apple appeared on the scene. However, the launch of products like AirPods, the Apple Watch, and the iPad have made its competitors almost a distant memory. As a result, it's not too concerning that Apple isn't currently one of the top dogs in AI.\n\nThe tech giant appears to be quietly honing its AI technology. Meanwhile, its leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech could see it steer the industry and become a major growth driver in getting AI into the hands of the average shopper.\n\nApple shares saw a slight surge on April 11 when Bloomberg reported that the company was overhauling its entire Mac lineup to expand its AI capabilities and meet soaring demand for such hardware. Meanwhile, the tech company has been gradually adding new AI features across its product lineup, including improvements to the iPhone's Siri and new gestures for the Apple Watch. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nLast year Apple generated nearly $107 billion in free cash flow, considerably more than some of AI's most prominent players, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon. This figure suggests that Apple is well-equipped to expand in the budding AI market and keep up with its rivals over the long term.\n\nApple's stock is trading at 25 times forward earnings, making it a reasonable buy and an exciting way to invest in AI.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been slightly overshadowed in AI over the last year by cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon. However, the company is easily one of the most exciting AI stocks for long-term gains.\n\nThe company is home to a long list of potent brands, including Google, Chrome, Android, and YouTube. These services regularly attract billions of users, giving Alphabet ample opportunity to tout its AI offerings.\n\nAs a result, the company's recent pivot to the lucrative market is promising. Earlier this year, Alphabet launched Gemini, its most advanced AI model to date. Its debut wasn't perfect, with the model making some mistakes at its launch presentation, which forced the company to temporarily pause its image generation services.\n\nHowever, Alphabet is moving forward in its AI development. The company recently announced plans to consolidate its Deep Mind and Research teams to promote efficiency in its AI division. Alphabet will move its AI-focused Responsible AI teams to Deep Mind, where its models are built.\n\nLike Intel and Apple, Alphabet's shares are a bargain compared to other AI stocks. Its forward P/E currently sits at an attractive 23, significantly lower than Microsoft's 34 and Amazon's 43.\n\nAlphabet's stock is a screaming buy this month, and one you won't want to miss out on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zuckerberg wants more companies to build Meta-powered headsets",
        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is taking a page out of Google’s Android playbook by announcing on Monday that his company will make its Meta Horizon operating system for AR/VR headsets open source. The move means that third-party firms will now be able to use Meta Horizon as the software backbone for their own headsets.\n\nZuckerberg announced the move via Instagram, saying that the next age of computing should be powered by an open software model.\n\n“Our goal is to make it so that the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets,” said Zuckerberg. “So that’s why we're releasing our operating system so that more companies can build different things on it.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\nGoogle’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android operating system is considered an open software model because it allows users to install third-party apps, albeit through a convoluted and annoying process. Windows PCs and Apple’s (AAPL) Macs also offer open software models, letting you download and install any apps you’d like.\n\nApple’s iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Vision Pro, however, are closed, meaning you can only install software from Apple’s App Store. It’s worth noting that Zuckerberg has a long-running distaste for Apple and its closed software model. The CEO has repeatedly criticized the company for not allowing certain app features on the iPhone and introducing privacy options that cut off Meta’s ability to capture user data. A MetaQuest 3 is seen on display during the Meta Connect Developer Conference at Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, California on Sept. 27, 2023. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nZuckerberg said Meta is already working with ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft (MSFT) on plans for future headsets, with more companies to follow. Though, he also pointed out that it will likely take a few years for the headsets to hit the market.\n\nThe plan, so far, seems to be for Meta’s partners to develop headsets for specific use cases. Meta currently offers its Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Zuckerberg pointed to an example of a lightweight headset that pairs to a computer on your desk dedicated to productivity work, while another could focus on watching movies and videos and be outfitted with high-resolution OLED displays.\n\nHe also touched on ideas for fitness-focused headsets built with lightweight, sweat-wicking materials, as well as an Xbox-style headset that connects to Microsoft’s Game Pass service and a controller to let gamers play anywhere they want. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a company try to build out an AR/VR ecosystem with third-party manufacturing partners. Microsoft also attempted to get its now-defunct Windows Mixed Reality platform off the ground with manufacturing partners like ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung building headsets powered by the software.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe headsets never caught on, though, and Microsoft is now set to remove the platform entirely from the next big Windows 11 update.\n\nThe AR/VR headset market is still a relatively niche technology segment, even among teens. According to Piper Sandler’s most recent Taking Stock with Teens survey, 33% of teens surveyed own a VR device, but only 4% use it on a daily basis. Another 13% said they use their headsets weekly, while a whopping 56% said they seldom use them. What’s more, 32% of teens said they aren’t interested in and have no plans to buy headsets.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Trump says Biden would be 'responsible' for any TikTok ban",
        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, April 22 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that President Joe Biden was \"pushing\" for a ban on TikTok and would be the one responsible if a ban were imposed, urging voters to take notice.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation on a 360-58 vote on Saturday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about nine months to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban.\n\nThe bill now moves to the Senate. If it passes there, Biden has said he would sign it into law.\n\nTrump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday that Biden would be \"responsible for banning TikTok. He is the one pushing it to close, and doing it to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant.\"\n\nTrump then urged younger voters - who make up a significant portion of the TikTok user base - to consider Biden's position on Election Day.\n\nHowever, when he was president in 2020, Trump himself sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat over national security concerns but was blocked by the courts.\n\nTikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, has argued that a ban would trample on free speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution for the 170 million users of its app in the country.\n\nThe company told employees over the weekend in an email seen by Reuters that as soon as Biden signs the legislation \"we will move to the courts for a legal challenge. We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson said on Monday: \"We do not want to ban apps like TikTok. What we want – and what the legislation we support would do – is ensure that TikTok becomes owned by an American company so that our and our children's sensitive personal data stays here instead of going to China and so that Americans' understandings and views can't be manipulated by algorithms potentially controlled by the PRC.\"\n\nRecently, Trump has argued that curbing TikTok would strengthen Meta Platforms' Facebook, a platform he has criticized since his access was revoked after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. His account was reinstated last year.\n\nUnder the legislation, app stores operated by Apple , Alphabet's Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications once the divestment deadline had passed.\n\nIn February, Biden's reelection campaign joined TikTok. Trump's campaign has not. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Earnings Season: Are These Mag 7 Members a Buy?",
        "content": "We have entered the heart of the 2024 Q1 earnings cycle with a notably stacked earnings schedule on deck for this week. The period has primarily been positive so far, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks.\n\nAnd concerning this week’s busy docket, two ‘Mag 7’ members – Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META – are scheduled to unveil quarterly results.\n\nAlphabet will report after the market close on April 25th, whereas Meta will report on April 24th after the market close. Shares of each have been considerably strong in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 handily. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdvertising revenue is a significant chunk of each company’s business and will undoubtedly be a focal point in the releases. But how does everything stack up heading into their quarterly releases? Let’s take a closer look at what’s expected.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe outlook for Meta’s upcoming release has turned visibly bright, with the $4.32 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 20% since the end of January and suggesting 63% year-over-year growth. Favorable cost-cutting measures have aided the company’s profitability picture in a big way. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Advertising revenue, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $35.6 billion, suggesting a sizable 27% growth rate from the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our expectations for this metric as of late, with the most recent beat totaling $827 million. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite their strong run, shares aren’t valuation stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 22.8X nearly in line with the 21.6X five-year median and well beneath highs of 31.5X in 2020. In addition, the current PEG ratio of 1.2X reflects that investors aren’t overpaying for the forecasted growth.\n\nShares have had a tough showing over the last month, losing roughly 5% alongside the S&P 500’s 4% decline. Further weakness post-earnings could be a great purchase point for investors if the company’s guidance is solid, which will keep analysts’ revisions positive.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAlphabet\n\nAnalysts haven’t shown as much positivity for Alphabet’s upcoming release compared to META, with the $1.49 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up a modest 2% since the end of January. The company’s forecasted growth remains strong, expected to post 28% earnings growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $60.1 billion, 10% higher than the year-ago mark of $54.5 billion. The company fell short of the consensus estimate in its latest release by $105 million, snapping a previous streak of positive surprises on the metric.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike META, shares aren’t overly stretched concerning valuation, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple nearly in line with the five-year median and well beneath highs of 32.6X in 2021. The PEG ratio works out to 1.4X, again in line with the five-year median and beneath five-year highs of 1.9X.\n\nShares have displayed relative strength over the last month, gaining 4% in value compared to the S&P 500’s 4% decline. Favorable commentary from the release concerning AI developments and advertising trends can help keep the stock’s momentum positive, though it is critical to follow analysts’ revisions post-earnings.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with a wide variety of companies scheduled to report quarterly results.\n\nAmong the bunch are two ‘Mag 7’ members – Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nBoth stocks have continued their momentum in 2024, outperforming handily. Analysts have been positive for both companies’ quarterly releases, though positive revisions are much more pronounced within META.\n\nPost-earnings weakness could be prevalent given the recently strong runs, though both companies’ fundamentals continue to make them an attractive long-term play.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser.

        "title": "Spotify earnings preview: Investors eye potential price hikes with profits in focus",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Wall Street expects the music streamer to swing to a profit on an adjusted basis as the company continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\n\"The hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call in February.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\"\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from the upcoming report, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.61 billion euros versus 3.04 billion euros in Q1 2023 Adjusted earnings per share: 0.65 euros versus adjusted loss of 1.16 euros in Q1 2023 Total monthly active users (MAUs): 618 million versus 515 million in Q1 2023 Premium subscribers: 239 million versus 210 million in Q1 2023\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\n\"Podcast margins were near breakeven in 4Q23, and management commentary signaled that margins are likely to positively inflect and drive profitability through 2024,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note on Friday ahead of the results.\n\nNollen maintained his Outperform rating on shares but raised his price target to $330 from $300 \"given the continued focus on profitability.\"\n\nSpotify guided to gross margins of 26.4% in Q1 after the metric came in at 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Over the long term, Spotify expects gross margins between 30% and 35% amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\n\"We think the change is welcome given Spotify's renewed focus on profitability,\" Nollen said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 25.\r\n\r\nThe company has been benefiting from growing investments in the generative AI technology, expanding presence in the booming cloud-computing market, increasing efforts to improve search results, solid uptake of Android and deepening focus on the wearables category in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, increasing litigation issues and expenses are likely to have been concerning.\r\n\r\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamentals of Alphabet ahead of its first-quarter 2024 results.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Efforts to Consider\n\nAlphabet’s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are expected to have continued aiding its search revenues in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well.

Solid momentum in the retail vertical is anticipated to have been a plus.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $60.18 billion, implying growth of 10.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nComing to non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is likely to have been a tailwind. Google’s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum across YouTubeTV and major updates in YouTube Premium are likely to have been other positives.\r\n\r\nThe growing momentum across Android and Pixel devices is expected to have benefited Alphabet’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned factors are anticipated to have benefited Google’s Services segment’s performance in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $69.04 billion, indicating growth of 11.4% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrength in Cloud & Other Bets to Benefit\n\nAlphabet has been significantly gaining momentum in the highly competitive cloud market for a while on the back of its expanding cloud service portfolio and an increasing number of data centers.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the Google Cloud segment in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIts strengthening generative AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google’s momentum among cloud customers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s strengthening efforts to bolster its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $384 million, suggesting growth of 33.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $66.02 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.7% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.49, indicating 27.3% growth from the previous year’s reported figure.

        "content": "The run may be over for the seven stocks that drove the lion's share of the stock market rally over the past year.\n\nUBS Investment Bank Chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub downgraded six of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) — from Overweight to Neutral in a new research note on Monday.\n\nHis call comes as the Magnificent 7, whichalso includes Tesla (TSLA), just had its largest weekly market cap loss in history. All seven of the big tech leaders are off their recent highs, as highlighted by a 10% single day-drawdown for Nvidia, its worst one day price performance since March 2020.\n\nGolub, who rates sectors within the S&P 500 (^GSPC) not individual stocks, remains Overweight on technology outside of the six stocks he names in his note. But for the large companies who have grown earnings significantly over the past year, Golub believes the tide may be shifting, and other areas are set to outperform the largest stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Investors attribute the run in mega cap stocks to animal spirits and the impact of AI,\" Golub wrote. \"However, our work indicates that surging earnings momentum (change in forward growth projections) fueled this upside. Unfortunately, this momentum is collapsing.\"\n\nTesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nEarnings for the S&P 500 have largely been driven by earnings growth in the large tech stocks. That's expected to play out again during first quarter reports, with FactSet projecting Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia to combine for earnings growth of roughly 64%. Meanwhile the other 495 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report an earnings decline of 6%.\n\nBut over the course of the year, this is expected to shift. Consensus estimates from FactSet show earnings for those five companies are set to end the year with just shy of 20% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly slower growth than their prior pace. By that point, consensus expects the other 495 companies to be growing earnings by about 17% compared to the year prior, a significant uptick from their current growth rate.\n\n\"Our downgrade of the Big 6—from Overweight to Neutral—is not predicated on extended valuations, or doubts about AI,\" Golub wrote. \"Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks. These forces do not apply to other TECH+ companies or the rest of the market in the same way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift in where earnings are growing the most could be \"disruptive in the near term,\" Golub said. But given increasing signs that the US economy is growing faster-than-expected this year, Golub thinks a broadening out in earnings performance over the next year keeps his 5,400 call on the S&P 500 to end the 2024 in play.\n\n\"This target remains supported by broadly positive fundamentals and a robust economy,\" Golub wrote.

        "title": "3 Stocks Most at Risk of AI’s Alarming Energy Consumption",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a Bitcoin (USD-BTC) moment and the situation could rapidly deteriorate for some of the biggest companies in this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBitcoin miners are energy intensive. Their thousands of computers generate excess heat that must be cooled and dissipated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates miners consume as much as 2.3% of all electricity produced in the U.S. It threatened to cause the segment to crash because of the rising costs. AI is in a similar situation but it could mushroom exponentially very fast.\n\nIn 2021, before the real explosion of AI, the EIA said data centers, one of the biggest AI users, were consuming about 2% of all the electricity produced. It noted they are “one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd AI is an energy hog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2026, or “roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S. alone, Boston Consulting Group estimates AI-powered data centers will consume as much as 7.5% of electric output by 2030, triple what it was in 2022.\n\nThe energy crisis is real because there is not enough capacity available to meet projected demand. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest data center operators for its cloud services business. CEO Andy Jassy told Fortune, “These large language models are so power hungry, and there’s just not enough energy right now.” The e-commerce giant recently purchased a nuclear-powered data center to help offset its electricity demands.\n\nAmazon operates 125 data centers globally but just 24 in the U.S. Below are three other giant data center operators at risk because of AI’s alarming energy consumption.\n\nEquinix (EQIX) corporate building with Equinix (EQIX) logo on it\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates 260 data centers in 71 major metropolitan areas around the globe. It understands the all-consuming nature of artificial intelligence in data centers. Equinix has been using AI-based software to reduce by 9% energy consumption at a Frankfurt data center and plans to roll it out to its other Frankfurt data centers. It was an essential response as Germany introduced an aggressive new law to increase energy efficiency.\n\nIf it wants to fulfill its expansion dreams, Equinix will need to deploy similar strategies elsewhere. The REIT wants to build out its xScale data centers for hyperscale usage. Hyperscalers are supersized cloud services providers like Amazon and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. These are the biggest drivers of AI demand as they seek out AI accelerators to boost their capacity. Google says its AI accounts for almost 15% of its data centers’ energy usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithout money-saving initiatives like this, Equinix could find itself pinched by growing demand of its xScale facilities.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it’s understood Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) need for data centers for its fast-growing Azure cloud service, what might not be as apparent is just how many the tech giant owns and operates itself.\n\nAccording to industry site Dgtl Infra, Microsoft operates 300 physical data centers in 64 regions globally. It is in the process of adding 15 more regions to its constellation, with each region having from one to three individual data centers. Together, Microsoft’s data centers span over 75 million square feet.\n\nMicrosoft needs this web of connectivity as it is one of the most prominent companies diving head-first into AI. Beyond the scalability AI provides Azure, the tech stock has integrated it throughout all of its products and services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, LinkedIn, Skype, Xbox and Outlook.\n\nBecause every facet of Microsoft’s business is tied to AI, the power demands it places on the grid are excessive. It also hints at the next pain point for AI: water consumption, an equally scarce resource. Google’s data centers used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 while Microsoft’s water usage soared 34%.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is the world’s largest data center REIT with 308 locations in 25 countries. As companies continue to transition their data to the cloud, they increasingly turn to DLR to house it. Among its biggest customers are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and hyperscaler Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAs much of the problem as AI is, Digital Realty sees it also being part of the solution. DLR says AI can measure and reduce consumption significantly by intuitively deploying resources at appropriate times. In a 2019 pilot program using its Apollo AI platform, DLR tested conservation methods at two European facilities. It rolled it out to 14 more soon after. Combined, Digital Realty was able to save about 18 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of savings.\n\nThe REIT offers hope that even as AI drives immense demand on energy resources, it can offset that by increasing efficiency. But whether that is possible on a global scale as AI usage increases exponentially remains to be seen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "It's Time to Ditch These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks and Replace Them With 2 Bona Fide Outperformers",
        "content": "Within the past couple of weeks, all three major stock indexes powered their way to fresh record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that are widely credited with lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to new heights.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, as the name implies, are seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. These seven components are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from crushing the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing-10-year period, the Magnificent Seven have undeniable competitive advantages. Examples include:\n\nNvidia controlling upwards of 90% of all graphics processing units deployed in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated enterprise data centers. Amazon being the leader in U.S. e-commerce retail market share and global cloud infrastructure service spend (via Amazon Web Services). Alphabet's Google accounting for an estimated 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, per GlobalStats.\n\nBut not all of the Magnificent Seven components are ultimately \"magnificent.\" To be brutally honest, some have been nothing short of operating duds over the past year. What follows are two Magnificent Seven stocks that should be sent to the chopping block, as well as the two phenomenal businesses that can logically replace them.\n\nIt's time to ditch this Magnificent Seven component: Tesla\n\nAs I stated plainly in late February, the Tesla growth story is officially dead. While the company has amassed a healthy cash pile to navigate a turbulent market for electric vehicles (EVs), and it's driven its first-mover advantages to four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, Tesla is a shell of what it was once advertised to be.\n\nTo begin with, the company has been aggressively reducing the sales price of Model's 3, S, X, and Y since the start of 2023. Between Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023, Tesla's operating margin was more-than-halved to 8.2%. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that EV demand dictates his company's pricing strategy. Yet even with aggressive price cuts, inventory levels have been stubbornly climbing.\n\nAnother issue with Tesla is that its efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many EV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has stalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-digits. Tesla's sales and profitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs -- and that's a segment that's under serious pressure right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've highlighted in the past, Tesla also generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources that include interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. This makes the company's premium valuation all the more egregious.\n\nTesla is an auto company losing its first-mover advantages that, in my view, has no business being viewed as a Magnificent Seven component. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt's also time to put this Magnificent Seven constituent out to pasture: Apple\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven stock that should be given the proverbial heave-ho is tech titan Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple's iPhone still dominates in the U.S., and the company's subscription-powered Services segment has been its most-consistent performer for years. Further, the $651 billion in share repurchases Apple has undertaken since the start of 2013 is tops among all public companies. A steady diet of buybacks has provided a boost to Apple's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe concern with Apple is that its growth engine has completely stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended in late September), sales declined in all of Apple's physical product segments. Through the first three months of fiscal 2024, iPad and Wearables generated double-digit percentage sales declines from the prior-year period.\n\nTo make matters worse, preliminary research data released from IDC last week shows that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by 9.6% to 50.1 million units from the previous year. iPhone is the company's top revenue driver.\n\nWhen Apple was valued at 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings, no one batted an eye if the company endured a growth hiccup. But at 27 times forecast EPS for the current fiscal year, a second consecutive year of zero or negative growth is too much of an eyesore to sweep under the rug.\n\nApple's best growth days may well be in the rearview mirror -- and for that reason, it no longer belongs in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe first outperformer that deserves its spot among the Magnificent Seven: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIf Tesla and Apple are shown the door, the first no-brainer company that should be viewed as a true Magnificent Seven component is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nWhile it's true that Berkshire isn't an innovator in the same capacity as either Tesla or Apple, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team have led Berkshire to virtually unmatched annualized returns dating back more than a half-century. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500.\n\nThree catalysts continue to make Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders richer over time. First off, Buffett and his team have a lengthy track record of generating big-time returns in the stock market. Berkshire's $361 billion investment portfolio contains 45 stocks and two index funds, with a heavy concentration in just four stocks (one of which happens to be Apple).\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly five dozen businesses, which have helped grow its operating revenue and income. Some of Berkshire's fully owned subsidiaries include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF. A portfolio weighted heavily to cyclical businesses gets to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe third reason Berkshire's stock keeps climbing is because Warren Buffett has given the green light to more than $74 billion worth of share buybacks since July 2018. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire's EPS and making its stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused long-term investors.\n\nA second outperformer that's proven it's magnificent: Visa\n\nThe other outstanding company that makes for a logical replacement for Tesla or Apple in the Magnificent Seven is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, you could certainly argue that Tesla and Apple are more innovative than Visa. But few companies have delivered for their shareholders on a more consistent basis than Visa has since its initial public offering in March 2008.\n\nIn the U.S., no payment processor accounts for a higher share of credit card network purchase volume than Visa. It was also the only payment facilitator in the U.S. that gained substantial share following the Great Recession. Since economic expansions last substantially longer than recessions, Visa benefits from the disproportionate long-term growth in spending from consumers and businesses.\n\nIt also has a lengthy growth runway beyond domestic borders. Emerging market regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia remain underbanked. Visa has the ability to organically expand its infrastructure into these markets, as well as quickly reach new regions by making acquisitions, just as it did in 2016 when it acquired Visa Europe.\n\nBest of all, Visa's management team has steered clear of becoming a lender. This strategic move ensures that it won't have to set aside capital during inevitable recessions to deal with credit delinquencies and loan losses. This is a competitive edge that's helped Visa maintain a juicy profit margin north of 50%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Japanese antitrust regulator said Alphabet Inc.’s Google used tactics that limited Yahoo Japan’s ability to compete in targeted search ads, and it promised to keep monitoring the US firm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Trump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway China Is Front and Center of Gold’s Record-Breaking Rally Tesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD Software The Fed’s Forecasting Method Looks Increasingly Outdated as Bernanke Pitches an Alternative\n\nFrom 2015 to 2022, Alphabet blocked Yahoo Japan from accessing technology needed to receive targeted ad revenue from searches on mobile devices, Japan’s Fair Trade Commission said. Alphabet changed its conduct as soon as the watchdog flagged the practice and has promised to give Yahoo Japan access to keyword-tied targeted ad tech, the FTC said Monday.\n\n“Google’s actions had a significant effect of limiting competition,” FTC official Saiko Nakajima told reporters. Yahoo Japan is a subsidiary of LY Corp., which operates the country’s biggest messaging app Line. The Japanese watchdog will continue to monitor the situation and reserves the right to reopen its investigation into Google, Nakajima said.\n\nThat promise was part of the FTC’s first-ever administrative action against Alphabet, which came with no penalty.\n\nAntitrust enforcers across the globe are increasingly worried that a small number of large companies control many of the world’s key technologies. Regulators fear that companies like Microsoft Corp., Google, and Amazon.com Inc. are using their technology and scale to frustrate or buy out potential rivals and remain on top.\n\nAlphabet is fending off complaints at home and abroad that it uses unlawful tactics to block competition. In the US, it faces a $700 million settlement after dozens of state attorneys general filed complaints that developers have to go through the Google Play app store to reach users.\n\nJapanese authorities are also probing Alphabet to see if it asked local smartphone makers to prioritize its search services on their devices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s antitrust watchdog said Monday that U.S. search giant Google must fix its advertising search restrictions affecting Yahoo in Japan.\n\nThe Japan Fair Trade Commission said in a statement that its recent study of Google’s practices showed it was undermining fair competition in the advertising market.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yahoo has merged with Japanese social media platform Line, and Line Yahoo declined comment.\n\nThe alleged questionable practices by Google began about a decade ago and continued for more than seven years, according to the commission.\n\nGoogle will be under review for the next three years, to ensure it carries out needed changes, the commission said. There is no immediate fine or other penalties for Google, which remains popular among Japanese.\n\nThe commission’s move follows another setback for Google in Japan. Last week, Japanese doctors filed a civil lawsuit against the company, demanding damages for what they claim are groundless derogatory and often false comments.\n\nThe Tokyo District Court suit demands 1.4 million yen ($9,400) in damages for 63 medical professionals, for reviews posted on Google Maps.\n\nGoogle said in response that it's working “24 hours a day” to reduce misleading or false information on its platform, combining human and technological resources “to delete fraudulent reviews.”\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on X https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why the stock market is having 'digestion problems' this earnings season",
        "content": "Earnings season hasn't been able to keep the stock market rally afloat over the past week.\n\nAfter an aggressive rally to all-time highs to start the year, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has tumbled in April as rising bond yields and slimmed expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have put a damper on investors' enthusiasm.\n\nAnd given the significant rise in share price of some of the market rally's darlings, even strong earnings aren't moving the needle for stocks.\n\n\"The broader market is having digestion problems in and around this earnings season,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis has broadly been seen across stock reactions in the day following the release of quarterly results for the 65 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far this season. Stocks that top Wall Street's estimates have risen 0.8% in the next trading session, slightly lower than the 0.9% average seen over the last few years, per Emanuel's research.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that disappoint on both metrics are taking a bigger hit than normal, with the average stock falling 5.8% in the next trading action, compared to the usual 3.1% decline seen over the past five years.\n\n\"Given these extended valuations [in the S&P 500], even good news may not be good news, particularly in these names that have run as far as they have,\" Emanuel said.\n\nEmanuel highlighted the recent price action following JPMorgan's (JPM) results, which topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. But the stock — which had hit multiple record highs earlier this year — traded lower on the day of its earnings report as the company didn't boost its 2024 interest income guidance like analysts had hoped.\n\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert echoed Emanuel's sentiment following the price action.\n\n\"Markets have priced in a higher probability of the Goldilocks scenario playing out this year, introducing more downside risk to 'good but not good enough' news,\" Chronert wrote in a note to clients on the day JPMorgan reported earnings. \"While very early, the first set of 1Q reports from the banks highlights this risk of guidance falling short of lofty implied growth expectations, even as the overall fundamental picture remains healthy.\"\n\nA similar narrative played out on Friday after Netflix (NFLX) topped Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates, flexing earnings per share growth of more than 83% from the year prior. But investors appeared hung up on revenue guidance for the second quarter, which came in at $9.49 billion instead of $9.51 billion, among other factors. The stock, which had rallied more than 150% in the past 18 months, sold off more than 8% on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney's top reason the stock traded lower after the report was simply \"expectations were high, and this wasn’t a beat & raise [guidance] quarter.\" The Netflix logo is shown in this photo from the company's website, in New York, Feb. 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThis backdrop comes as one of the busiest weeks of S&P 500 financial releases in the quarter is set to greet investors. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) will headline the week of earnings results, and all three face stiff comparisons. Meta is expected to grow earnings by more than 96%, per Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, analysts project Alphabet's earnings grew by more than 30% this quarter compared to last year. Microsoft is expected to see nearly 16% growth.\n\nAll three are part of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 by market cap, which Goldman Sachs noted on April 5 are expected to driveearnings growth for the index this quarter. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 — primarily the \"Magnificent Seven\" — are expected to see earnings grow by 32% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the other 490 stocks are projected to produce an earnings decline of 4%.\n\nGiven the market's recent jitteriness around rising yields and the lack of hope around Fed rate cuts, the performance of these companies will be \"pivotal\" for the market's direction moving forward, SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google consolidates AI-focused DeepMind, Research teams",
        "content": "Google announced on Thursday that it will consolidate a pair of its internal teams that are focused on building artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a blog post on the company's website that explained the decision to consolidate teams that build AI models within the Google DeepMind team, including teams from the company's Research division. Google DeepMind was created last year through the merger of the Google Brain team with DeepMind and other researchers focused on AI systems.\n\nPichai said that move \"helped accelerate our Gemini models\" and unified machine learning (ML) infrastructure and developer teams: \"The progress in just one year has been incredible: Gemini models are seen as leaders and keep getting better. And our successive breakthroughs have put us on a path to deliver the world's most advanced, safe, and responsible AI.\"\n\n\"Now, to accelerate this progress, we're going to consolidate the teams that focus on building models across Research and GoogleDeepMind. All of this work will now sit in Google DeepMind and scale our capacity to deliver capable AI for our users, partners and customers,\" Pichai explained. \"This will simplify development by concentrating compute-intensive model building in one place and establishing single access points for PAs looking to take these models and build generative AI applications.\"\n\nGEMINI FALLOUT: FORMER GOOGLE EMPLOYEE WARNS OF 'TERRIFYING PATTERNS' IN COMPANY'S AI ALGORITHMS Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the consolidation of AI model development teams within Google's DeepMind unit.\n\n\"This change also gives Google Research a clear and distinct mandate to continue investing in foundational and applied computer science research in three key areas that tie directly to Google's mission: computing systems (including quantum), foundational ML and algorithm, and applied science and society,\" Pichai wrote.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"Fundamental computer science research is in our DNA and we have some of the world's best computer scientists,\" he added. \"We simply would not be the company we are today without the researchers who developed the foundations on which all Google's products are built and are now inventing, the foundations for our future.\"\n\n'GOOGLERS AGAINST GENOCIDE' LEAD SIT-INS, PROTESTS COAST-TO-COAST AT TECH GIANT'S OFFICES Google created its DeepMind team last year to help organize the company's AI model development.\n\nGoogle is also moving its Responsible AI teams from Research to DeepMind to \"be closer to where the models are built and scaled.\" It also moved other responsibility teams into its central Trust and Safety team, where the company is investing more in AI testing and evaluations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We need to be the best in class at deploying accurate, trustworthy, and transparent AI products for users and customers,\" Pichai wrote.\n\nPichai's comments come after Google Gemini sparked controversy with biased responses when prompted with political or charged social topics. The company paused Gemini's image generation feature after Gemini was shown to be creating historically inaccurate images that sometimes replaced White people with images of Black, Native American and Asian people. Pichai said the images were \"biased\" and \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Google's Gemini generative AI tool sparked controversy earlier this year.\n\nPichai referenced the need to ensure Google's AI products are objective as well the need to keep political disputes out of the workplace after an incident last week in which 28 employees were fired after staging a sit-in to protest the company's ties to Israel amid the war against Hamas.\n\n\"We have a culture of vibrant, open discussion that enables us to create amazing products and turn great ideas into action. That's important to preserve,\" Pichai wrote. \"But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics. This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.\"\n\n\"We have a duty to be an objective and trusted provider of information that serves all of our users globally. When we come to work, our goal is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. That supersedes everything else and I expect us to act with a focus that reflects that,\" Pichai added.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Google consolidates AI-focused DeepMind, Research teams\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Opinion: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Will Be the Largest Companies in the World by 2030",
        "content": "Making long-term predictions is difficult. Who would have guessed 10 years ago that Nvidia would be one of the largest companies by market cap in the world? Very few.\n\nDespite this uncertain future, I still believe it is useful for investors to look out five to 10 years and think about what companies could be much larger than they are today. Otherwise, you are just making shots in the dark and should probably buy index funds instead.\n\nWhile not a certainty, I think \"Magnificent Seven\" giants Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be the two largest companies in the world by 2030. Here's why.\n\n1. Amazon: Put everything in the cloud\n\nAmazon's culture of innovation has allowed it to win in multiple large product categories. Most of us know it as the dominant e-commerce platform in North America, which brings in hundreds of billions in annual sales. But it is not the most profitable segment for Amazon today: That distinction goes to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS is the largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide, bringing in $91 billion in revenue and just under $25 billion in operating income last year. Its major competitors are Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other smaller providers, but AWS has remained the largest cloud service since its inception around two decades ago, with around 31% market share.\n\nEven though AWS is already large, there is still plenty of room for the cloud to gain market share versus legacy computing solutions. Analysts expect the industry to grow at a 19% rate through 2030. If AWS can maintain its market share and profit margin profile, that will lead to the division to grow its earnings at 19% a year and hit over $90 billion in 2030. Add in the monster e-commerce division, international expansion in places such as India, and moonshots like the Project Kuiper internet service, and I think Amazon has a good chance of being one of the two largest companies in the world by 2030.\n\n2. Alphabet: Multiple levers for growth\n\nAnd who will the other be? Well, all we need to do is look at one of Amazon's cloud computing competitors. GOOG Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and other projects like self-driving company Waymo. Google Cloud should see the same growth benefits as AWS, growing from a $36 billion annualized revenue rate at the end of 2023 to close to $100 billion in revenue by 2030. That should generate a lot of value for Alphabet, but it's not the only ace up its sleeve.\n\nFirst, we need to highlight Google Search and how much revenue it generates. The dominant search engine worldwide generated $48 billion in revenue just in the fourth quarter of 2023 and should do $200 billion in annual sales within a few years. As the key advertising engine for many industries like travel, insurance, and financial services, Google Search revenue should grow along with global GDP as more of the world starts using smartphones and the internet.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's not forget YouTube. Alphabet owns the largest video platform worldwide, which generated $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter. YouTube has billions of users around the world and is the most popular streaming video service on TVs in the United States. Yes, that is TVs in the United States, not all devices.\n\nYouTube is a growing entertainment mainstay for people around the world. I think it will be even more dominant in 2030.\n\nLast year, Alphabet generated $85.7 billion in operating earnings. With so many growth levers to pull, it seems likely that the company will continue growing its earnings over the next few years. By 2030, I think this will lead the Magnificent Seven giant to pass the likes of Apple and Microsoft and become one of the two largest companies in the world alongside Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 21 small business ideas for kids. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Small Business Ideas for Kids.\n\nShopify for Kids: Igniting the Entrepreneurial Spirit\n\nShopify Inc.

According to a survey by Junior Achievement USA, of 1,000 US teens between the ages of 13 and 17, 60% of respondents want to start their own business as opposed to working a job. The rise of content creators and social media has also developed entrepreneurial interests in kids, as 2 in 5 American teens were motivated by influencers and celebrities to start their own businesses. Moreover, 37% of teens also voted in favor of adding courses that teach entrepreneurship to their school curriculums.\n\nYouTube, a product of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most popular platforms for kids. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube does not allow users under 13 to set up a YouTube account. Children between 13 and 17 may create a channel but they do require consent from their parents. YouTube for Kids is a safer version of YouTube, specifically for kids. Ads placed and content published on YouTube for Kids are carefully monitored. YouTube for Kids has more than 500 million downloads on the Google Play Store, as of April 21, 2024. On December 11, 2023, CNN reported that YouTube remained undefeated as the top choice among kids and teens. 93% of the 1,500 teens surveyed stated they used YouTube. Such explains why we should expect a new wave of young media influencers on Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube in the future. Let's take a look at some of the notable kid influencers on YouTube who are viral personal vloggers.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyan's World is a viral channel on YouTube made by a kid. The YouTube channel has more than 36.9 million subscribers, as of April 21, 2024. The YouTube channel covers the day to day life of Ryan in a fun and attention-grabbing way. The kid creates a range of content including music videos, demonstrations of science experiments, do-it-yourself arts projects, and more.\n\nNextdoor: The Role of Social Community in Promoting Businesses\n\nAnthony Gonzalez started his business at the age of 13. Gonzalez calls himself \"The Garbage Kid.\" He would clean trash bins around his neighborhood. He first started his business from 35 homes. A few weeks into the venture, Gonzalez had over 100 clients. His mother and sister would help him book appointments. The Garbage Kid has more than 2,000 followers on Instagram, as of April 21, 2023. While Gonzalez has gained fame through his venture, a neighborhood-centric business may benefit more from a community platform like Nextdoor. Let's discuss how Nextdoor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KIND) would have helped The Garbage Kid.\n\nNextdoor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KIND) is a social platform connecting local neighborhoods. Once connected, communities can then rely on each other for assistance, help, recreation, connection, or companionship. Nextdoor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KIND) is based in 11 countries, 1 in 3 households in the United States use the app, and it had 41.8 million weekly active neighbors, as of December 31, 2023. The company helps businesses of all sizes to promote their business on the app. Through the app, kids can market their cleaning, car washing, and tech support services business. 76% of neighbors have been influenced to use a product or service after receiving a recommendation on Nextdoor. Creating a business page on Nextdoor, engaging with neighbors, and enhancing search engine presence are all free services. Kids may also place ads to reach a wider audience. Here are some comments from Nextdoor Holdings, Inc.'s (NYSE:KIND) Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"We added a record number of organic Verified Neighbors for the second straight quarter and ended the year with more than 88 million Verified Neighbors growing 13% year-over-year. Q4 WAU grew to 41.8 million, up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We expect this sequential growth in WAU to continue into Q1. Users remain active and engagement is high on our platform. Impression growth was strong. Session depth, which reflects the number of ad impression opportunities during each user session, increased by 36% year-over-year and accelerated versus Q3, ending the year at a record level. Our growth algorithm is simple: continued user and engagement growth, new advertiser growth boosted by our self-serve capabilities, increasingly durable advertiser retention as more demand is delivered via our proprietary ad server, and a reduced cost base to better enable both growth and positive free cash flow.\n\nOur progress wasn't limited to user growth and engagement metrics. We're leveraging AI and machine-learning across our platform in a variety of ways from using our local knowledge graph to help businesses reach their target audiences, to improving notifications and optimizing ad delivery, to enhancing platform vitality. As we noted in our recently released 2023 transparency report, 26% of neighbors use the revised language suggested to them by generative AI to make their posts more constructive. And neighbor feedback suggests very high levels of satisfaction with our AI-based kindness reminder. So it's very clear that even at this early stage, the AI tools we've developed are having a measurable impact on our user experience driving positivity.\n\nWe also made progress delivering advertiser value and reducing advertiser effort. For the full year, we retained 90% of our top 50 customers. We saw continued strong performance from mid-market and SMB customers, many of whom have begun to see the benefits of our owned and operated ad platform and are benefiting from the performance optimizations we can now make.\"\n\nNow that we have discussed some possible options for kids with a strong entrepreneurial spirit, let's discuss the 21 small business ideas for kids. You can also take a look at unique business ideas for women. 21 Small Business Ideas for Kids\n\n21 Small Business Ideas for Kids\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo gather a list of the 21 small business ideas for kids, we consulted over 10 rankings and reports on the internet. We picked the business ideas that appeared in 50% of our sources and then ranked them.\n\n21 Small Business Ideas for Kids\n\n21. Tech Support\n\nKids can provide tech support to people in their neighborhood. An official business can be set up once the kid acquires enough social and financial capital.\n\n20. YouTube Channel\n\nKids under the age of 13 are not allowed to start their own channels. However, adults and guardians can set up and run a channel for their kids. Gaming and DIY channels are particularly very famous.\n\n19. Shirt Designing\n\nKids can create designs of their choice and sell printed shirts through online stores. \"Create Your OWN\" Shirt on Amazon sells customized t-shirts. Their custom black t-shirt is a best-selling item on Amazon. More than 400 items of the product were sold during the past month.\n\n18. Recycling\n\nRecycling is one of the best business ideas for kids. Ryan Hickman started a recycling business as a three-year-old. He started the business by asking his neighbors to store plastic bags and bottles for him. Ryan then sorted these collectibles and sent them for recycling. As of 2022, Ryan had recycled more than 500,000 bottles and cans.\n\n17. Pop Up Shop Owner\n\nPop up shops are cheaper alternatives to permanent shopping outlets. Pop up shops are temporary shopping arrangements for scheduled events primarily. Kids can set up pop up shops to sell candies or other related kid's products on special events such as neighborhood festivities and birthday parties.\n\n16. Pet Sitter\n\nMost pet sitting agencies have a lower age limit required to become a pet sitter. Normally children below the age of 10 are not allowed to become pet sitters. However, kids can informally overlook pets in their trusted neighborhood.\n\n15. Peer to Peer Tutoring\n\nPeer-to-peer tutoring is another great business idea for kids. While an adult can moderate peer-to-peer tutoring, kids can set up their own peer-to-peer tutoring business to bring kids together to engage in academic activities.\n\n14. Party Planning\n\nKids are fond of parties with fellow kids at school or in their neighborhood. Children are able to come up with party themes fellow kids would like. They can also decide what games are to be played and what should go on the menu.\n\n13. Online Shop\n\nWith some help from adults or a guardian, kids can set up an online shop to sell toys, books, arts and crafts, and educational materials. These items can be sold on Amazon, eBay, and Etsy.\n\n12. Online Content Creation & Blogging\n\nStarting an online content creation or blogging venture is one of the best business ideas for kids. Alex Stringer started a blog, Alexknowitall7, at the age of seven. The blog is published on WordPress.\n\n11. Musical Performer\n\nChild artists are quite popular across the globe. Kids with a passion for music and singing may dive into the domain and start their own business as performers. Miles Bonham is a seven-year-old performer. He has an Instagram account, milesmusickid, with 2.6 million followers, as of April 21, 2024.\n\n10. Lawn Care & Gardening\n\nLawn Care & Gardening is one of the best business ideas for kids. Kids can provide gardening services or become assistants to adult gardeners. Kids can start offering gardening services in their neighborhood.\n\n9. Kids Book Author\n\nKids like to read books written by fellow kids of the same age. Jake Marcionette published his first book when he was 12 years old. His series, Just Jake, is quite popular and has an average customer star rating of 4.6, as of April 21, 2024.\n\n8. Illustrator\n\nKids can also become great illustrators. The new generation of kids is highly tech-equipped. Kids can become digital illustrators and sell their artwork through social commerce platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest.\n\n7. Homemade Crafts\n\nMaking and selling arts and crafts is one of the best business ideas for kids. Kids can sell paintings and crafts on sites such as Etsy. The \"Large Colorful Wall Art Autumn\" piece on Etsy is a best seller and is priced at $140. It has 577 customer reviews, as of April 21, 2024.\n\n6. Gaming\n\nGaming is highly popular among kids.

        "title": "Fed's favorite inflation gauge and Big Tech earnings greet a slumping stock market: What to know this week",
        "content": "The market rally is at its most fragile point in months.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended Friday below 5,000, its first close below that mark since late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 5% on the week while the Dow held flat.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of first quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the March reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results headlined by Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge\n\nSeveral months of bumpy inflation readings have forced investors to scale back their projections for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year.\n\nOn Friday, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said \"progress on inflation has stalled\" when noting that it \"makes sense\" for the central bank to wait for more clarity on inflation's path.\n\nThis makes Friday's PCE reading all the more critical.\n\nEconomists expect \"core\" PCE clocked in at 2.7% in March from the previous year, down from February's 2.8% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.3%, in line with last month's change.\n\n\"Should core PCE inflation come in around 0.25% [month-over-month] for March and April, the year-on-year reading will slow from 2.8% to 2.6%, giving the Fed cover to begin 'gradually' adjusting policy rates lower starting in June or July,\" Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a note to clients on April 17.\n\nGrowth update\n\nPart of the reason investors had largely taken the repricing of Fed interest rate cuts in stride has been an increasingly positive economic backdrop. Throughout the first quarter, economists have been raising their projections for economic growth. Thursday will bring the first look at whether the US economy grew as fast as forecast in the first three months of this year.\n\nEconomists expect that the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in the first quarter, lower than the 3.4% seen in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\"Incoming data continue to point to ongoing economic resilience in an environment of higher rates,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"The consumer continues to remain strong. The economy has cooled modestly since the outsized 4.9% growth rate seen in 3Q, but what cooling there is has been gradual.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings aren't impressing\n\nGiven the significant run-up in share price that some of the market rally's darlings have experienced this year, even better-than-expected earnings aren't moving the needle for stocks.\n\n\"The broader market is having digestion problems in and around this earnings season,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis has broadly been seen across stock reactions the day following the release of quarterly results for the 65 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far this season. Stocks that top Wall Street's estimates have risen 0.8% in the next trading session, slightly lower than the 0.9% average seen over the last few years, per Emanuel's research.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that disappoint on both metrics are taking a bigger hit than normal, with the average stock falling 5.8% in the next trading action, compared to the usual 3.1% decline seen over the past five years.\n\n\"Given these extended valuations [in the S&P 500], even good news may not be good news, particularly in these names that have run as far as they have,\" Emanuel said.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nWith earnings reports not satisfying investors, the baton will be passed to one of the strongest parts of the market over the past year: Big Tech.\n\nDespite a sell-off across tech last week after disappointing results from chipmakers and Netflix (NFLX), earnings growth expectations are still sky-high for Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which are all expected to report in the week ahead.\n\nFactSet noted on Friday that these companies, along with Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN), are expected to have grown earnings by 64.3% in the first quarter. The other 495 companies are projected to see earnings decline by 6%.\n\nSurging yields\n\nOutside of earnings, investors will closely watch the economic data this week to see how it might shift movements in rising bond yields, which are becoming a pain point for investors again.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield shot up to 5% on Tuesday for the first time since the most recent stock market bottom in October 2023. The move came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it's taking \"longer than expected\" for inflation to fall to its 2% target.\n\nAnd Evercore ISI's Emanuel believes this will be a key pain point for stocks, just as it was during a sell-off in the market last fall.\n\n\"The reason it might be more of the concern at this point is because of that implicit promise that markets have traded on of three [Fed rate] cuts dialed back,\" Emanuel said. \"And if you look at it going back to March, I think it's a lot more than a confidence the market rolled over from the highs literally precisely the moment the market started pricing in fewer than those three promised cuts.\"\n\nEmanuel cautioned that it might be time to get defensive in the market because of this. He recommended exposure to sectors such as Health Care (XLV) and Consumer Staples (XLP) while also noting the roughly 5% that can be earned by holding cash in a money market account is still a viable portion of a portfolio.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, March (+0.05 prior)\n\nEarnings: Albertsons (ACI), Bank of Hawaii (BOH), Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE), SAP (SAP), Truist (TFC), Verizon (VZ), Zions Bancorporation (ZION)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, April, preliminary (52.0 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 52.1 previously); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, April (-11 prior); New home sales, March (670,000 expected, 662,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, March (1.2% expected, -0.3% previously)\n\nEarnings:  Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), General Electric (GE), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Mattel (MAT), PepsiCo (PEP), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Spotify (SPOT), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Tesla (TSLA), UPS (UPS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Visa (V)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending April 19 (+3.3% prior); Durable Goods Orders, March preliminary (+2.5% expected, +1.3% prior)\n\nEarnings: Meta Platforms (META), AT&T (T), Boeing (BA), Chipotle (CMG), Ford (F), Humana (HUM), ADP (ADP), eBay (EBAY), General Dynamics (GD), Hilton (HLT), IBM (IBM), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), ServiceNow (NOW), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: First quarter GDP, first estimate (+2.5% annualized rate expected, +3.4% previously); First quarter personal consumption, first estimate (+2.6% expected, 3.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended, April 20 (215,000 expected, 212,000 previously); Pending home sales, month-over-month, March (+1.0% expected, +1.6% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), American Airlines (AAL), AstraZeneca (AZN), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), Mobileye (MBLY), Roku (ROKU), Snap (SNAP), Royal Caribbean (RCL), Southwest (LUV), T-Mobile (TMUS)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal income, month-over-month, March (+0.5% expected, +0.3% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, March (+0.6% expected, +0.8% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, March (+2.6% expected, +2.5% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, March (+2.7% expected; +2.8% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, April, final reading (77.9 expected, 77.9 previously)\n\nEarnings: Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Charter Communications (CHTR), Colgate (CL)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Are Investors Undervaluing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) By 28%?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$215 Alphabet's US$154 share price signals that it might be 28% undervalued The US$167 analyst price target for GOOGL is 23% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nDoes the April share price for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$80.4b US$91.7b US$108.5b US$123.2b US$135.4b US$144.5b US$152.3b US$159.1b US$165.2b US$170.7b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x18 Analyst x18 Analyst x10 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.73% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.46% Est @ 3.81% Est @ 3.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$75.0k US$79.8k US$88.1k US$93.4k US$95.8k US$95.4k US$93.8k US$91.4k US$88.6k US$85.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$887b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$171b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.3%) = US$3.6t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.6t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$154, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.060. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Interactive Media and Services industry.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With Massive Potential That Billionaire Investors Love",
        "content": "It probably won't surprise you to learn that some of the Magnificent Seven stocks are among the most common holdings among billionaire hedge fund managers. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are extremely common holdings, as are several of the other mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nHowever, it can be more interesting to see what tech stocks billionaires think could be the next big things. Here are three tech stocks, owned by some of the most prominent hedge funds in the United States, that could have massive growth potential in the years ahead.\n\nA metaverse play with massive potential\n\nRoblox(NYSE: RBLX) is a major holding of Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund, which owns nearly $400 million of stock in the gaming platform provider. And while the progress of the metaverse gaming platform has certainly been impressive, it could still be in the earlier stages of growth.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Roblox had 71.5 million daily active users (DAUs) on its platform, 22% more than a year earlier. Management believes it could scale this to 1 billion DAUs over time, especially as wearable technology evolves and Roblox builds its presence in high-population international markets. The global metaverse market is expected to grow from $90 billion in 2023 to nearly $1 billion by 2030, and Roblox could be one of the biggest winners.\n\nRoblox is doing a great job of improving the efficiency of its business and expects to achieve positive free cash flow in 2024, and to expand margins by 100-300 basis points per year through at least 2027. Plus, management is doing a great job of finding new ways to monetize the platform, such as immersive advertising.\n\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the tech sector\n\nRenaissance Technology – the hedge find led by Jim Simons – has a $450 million stake in cybersecurity platform CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). And while AI has been the center of attention so far in 2024, cybersecurity remains a massive and long-tailed opportunity.\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in cloud-based cybersecurity and was an early AI leader, using the technology to develop the best threat-detection capabilities on the market. And as the company grows, its capabilities get even stronger. After all, the company uses crowdsourced data (hence the name) to learn about and find security issues.\n\nCrowdStrike generates over $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue today, but this could be just a starting point. Management sees a $100 billion addressable market opportunity for the business, but with the rapid growth and evolution of the cybersecurity industry, it believes that within the next few years, the market will grow to $225 billion in size and that CrowdStrike can achieve $10 billion in ARR by the end of this decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nA high-potential social media platform\n\nSocial media platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is the largest technology stock owned by Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and by a wide margin.\n\nPinterest's business has been performing quite well recently, rebounding nicely from a growth slowdown after the pandemic-era surge subsided. The user base reached 498 million at the end of 2023, 11% more than a year prior, and the company was far more profitable with 86% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere are several promising growth avenues. CEO Bill Ready is relatively new in the role and has made some exciting moves to boost Pinterest's e-commerce potential. And it's also worth noting that while Pinterest makes the bulk of its money from North American users, international users actually make up about 80% of the total and have tons of monetization potential in the years ahead.\n\nThree high-potential businesses\n\nTo be sure, I'd never suggest investing in a particular stock just because a certain billionaire or hedge fund does. But these are three excellent businesses that have large addressable market opportunities, excellent leadership, and strong momentum, and they could be worth a closer look for your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roblox right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roblox, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roblox wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Alphabet 10 Years Ago, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",
        "content": "There's no denying Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) potent position in tech. The company's $1.9 trillion market cap makes it the fourth most-valuable company in the world, illustrating the brand power of platforms like YouTube, Android, and Chrome, and the many services under Google. Time and time again, the stock has proved itself to be a valuable long-term holding. GOOG Chart\n\nThe company's share price has soared 489% over the last decade, meaning a cash investment of $10,000 in 2014 would be worth nearly $59,000 today, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nBut is it still worth investing in Alphabet, or is it too late? Let's take a closer look at the business to determine if its stock is still a buy.\n\nA long list of potent names has made Alphabet an advertising powerhouse\n\nAlphabet hit the jackpot when it launched its search engine Google in 1998, becoming a gateway to the internet for billions of users. And the company has done well to retain its market dominance, with an 82% share among search engines.\n\nThe success of Google has allowed Alphabet to branch out to other markets, including smartphone operating systems, online video sharing, cloud computing, productivity software, and more. But its smartest move has been leveraging the massive user base it has built with these services to become a digital advertising powerhouse.\n\nThe company is now home to nine platforms that each have more than 1 billion users, giving it nearly endless opportunities to sell ads.\n\nData from Statista shows the digital advertising market is projected to reach more than $740 billion this year, with spending expected to rise to $871 billion by 2027. And Alphabet holds a leading 26% market share in this sector, so it's prepared to continue serving this ad market and profit from its growth.\n\nBenefiting from the tailwinds of AI\n\nSince 2019, annual revenue has risen 90%, while operating income increased by 135%. In that time, its free cash flow has climbed 151% to $69 billion. The chart below compares that last figure to those of some of its biggest rivals. GOOG Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis impressive growth can largely be attributed to the success of Alphabet's digital ad business. And it could also suggest that the company is better equipped than its competitors to keep expanding and invest in budding technology like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached a valuation of close to $200 billion last year and is expanding at a pace to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. So it's a promising sign that Alphabet is focusing on monetizing this technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company launched its most advanced AI model, Gemini, earlier this year. And it reportedly plans to consolidate its Deep Mind and its Research teams to further strengthen its AI capabilities.\n\nReuters said that Alphabet will move its Responsible AI teams, which focus on safe AI development, from Research to DeepMind to be closer to where AI models are built and scaled up.\n\nThere are multiple practical uses for the technology that could bolster its earnings in the coming years. For example, improving its AI capabilities could further secure the company's hold on the search engine market by creating a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAI could also enhance Google Cloud, make its ads more effective for marketers, and improve users' experience on YouTube with better video recommendations. If done right, Alphabet could elevate its entire business with AI, and boost its stock price over the long term. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart suggests Alphabet's stock is one of the best investments on the basis of value when compared to those three peers in big tech. It has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash-flow, indicating its shares are a relative bargain.\n\nAlthough the stock has skyrocketed over the last decade, its potent position in tech and the emergence of AI suggest that it's not done yet. Alphabet is a screaming buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Alphabet Stock Before Thursday?",
        "content": "For the record, attempting to perfectly time your trades' entries and exits is usually a bad idea. Predicting a stock's (or the broad market's) short-term ebb and flow simply can't be done with any consistency.\n\nAs a means of optimizing the balance of risk and reward, though, sometimes there's a case to be made for hurrying up or holding off on a new position.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is forcing such a choice on interested investors right now. While this Thursday's earnings report in and of itself isn't a reason to buy or sell the stock, if you were mulling a purchase of Alphabet shares anyway, you might want to go ahead and take the plunge now. Here's why.\n\nThere's a reason the previous post-earnings stumble didn't last\n\nDon't misread the message: If you choose to step into a new Alphabet stake after it posts its first-quarter numbers after Thursday's close on April 25, you'll be fine. A year from now, you probably won't care either way or even remember if it mattered.\n\nHowever, there's a reasonably good chance Alphabet stock's going to move higher rather than lower in response to its Q1 numbers.\n\nThat wasn't the way it happened a quarter earlier. Although the company topped both its revenue and earnings estimates, its ad revenue of $65.5 billion fell just a bit short of the $65.9 billion analysts were anticipating. Since this is Alphabet's single-biggest business, the stock tumbled more than 7% on the news.\n\nThen a funny thing happened. Although shares waffled a bit for the next couple of trading days, within a couple of weeks they were well above its post-earnings low. Now, nearly three months later, Alphabet stock is above its previous pre-earnings peak.\n\nWhat gives? It's not a tough matter to figure out. With some time to consider all the numbers, investors decided they liked Alphabet's fourth-quarter results after all.\n\nAnd well they should. Overall revenue was up 13% year over year, with YouTube's top-line growth of 15.5% taking up the slack seen on other fronts. Operating income for all of its advertising business was collectively up 32%.\n\nIn fact, the ad revenue that came up short of expectations was still up 11% year over year. In the meantime, all of its most important numbers rolled in better than expected, maintaining the company's rekindled streak of earnings beats in addition to extending an uninterrupted (except for the second quarter of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing) multiyear streak of year-over-year quarterly revenue growth.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIt's unlikely the market will make the same mistake with this stock again -- at least not this soon. Indeed, investors may be underestimating Alphabet now, setting the stage for a post-earnings pop.\n\nTwo key catalysts for Alphabet stocks\n\nForecasters clearly got the company's Q4 ad revenue wrong; they've probably adjusted their future calls accordingly in the meantime. Analysts may have even overcorrected them, in fact, just to be sure they don't repeat the more serious mistake of overestimating how well a company is doing. (Underestimating a corporation's performance is considerably more forgivable, particularly if you at least correctly predict in which direction its numbers are moving.)\n\nThere are a couple of potential catalysts lurking in the upcoming first-quarter report, however, that are more than a little likely to light a fire under this stock. The first of these catalysts is YouTube's ad revenue.\n\nAs was noted, YouTube's advertising sales were up a healthy 15.5% during the final quarter of 2023. The online video platform has continued to widen its reach, though. Video-viewership ratings house Nielsen reports that YouTube and Netflix are the only two major streaming platforms to grow their share of total U.S. view time during the first quarter of 2024. That being said, YouTube ultimately takes top honors here by virtue of generating more total view time than Netflix does.\n\nAlphabet's cloud computing business could also prove inspirational to onlooking investors. This arm swung to a profit in the first quarter of last year, and while it's remained in the black and even widened its bottom line since then, this young business's profitability has also remained difficult to forecast.\n\nThat's been a source of short-lived setbacks for Alphabet stock in the meantime. As time marches on, though, the company's cloud computing business is becoming more predictable, dialing back the risk of unpleasant surprises.\n\nAlphabet also recently unveiled a home-grown artificial intelligence (AI) processor that can legitimately compete with AI hardware powerhouse Nvidia. This unveiling happened in conjunction with the launch of new updated coding options for AI-minded users of its chat-based personal assistant app Gemini. If the upcoming earnings conference call can successfully relay the potential of this new tech and these new tools, that too could prove bullish for the stock.\n\nAnalysts are already starting to see this potential, by the way, to the extent it might help the stock after Thursday's Q1 report. For instance, JPMorgan believes the new-and-improved version of Google's Gemini could accelerate the company's cloud revenue growth to a pace of 20%, if not more.\n\nTaking action now is the lower-risk move here, but...\n\nIs this a guarantee that shares will fight their way higher following Thursday afternoon's release of Alphabet's first-quarter numbers? Of course not. There are always potential pitfalls. It's also possible the market itself will be sinking then, dragging this stock lower with it despite a healthy quarterly report.\n\nIt's also worth repeating that for long-term investors, any such short-term volatility doesn't really matter. If you've got the itch to at least try to squeeze out a few dollars' worth of additional profits on a position, though, the bigger calculated risk here is in waiting rather than acting before Thursday's close. And if for some reason you don't step in before Thursday and the stock ends up falling following the release of earnings, Alphabet shares are most definitely worth buying on that dip. Remember, the tumble following its Q4 results was certainly a great entry opportunity.\n\nOh, by the way, the analyst community expects Alphabet to report revenue of nearly $74 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share. Both numbers are measurably above year-ago comparisons.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "My Top 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks has been a powerhouse in the market since the start of 2023, with all of them beating the S&P 500. It includes:\n\nMicrosoft  Apple Nvidia Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla\n\nThis collection has had a strong run, but not every one of them is a strong buy right now, in my opinion. Nearly every one of these companies has artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations, but my reason for buying three of the seven stocks is centered around a much older practice: Advertising.\n\nAdvertising is a massive industry\n\nIf advertising is my reason to buy some of these stocks, then Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are the ones I'm talking about. This trio generates a massive amount of revenue each quarter from advertising.\n\nCompany Q4 Advertising Revenue Alphabet  $65.5 Billion Meta Platforms  $38.7 Billion Amazon $14.7 Billion\n\nData sources: Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta are leaders in this category, some may be surprised that Amazon is also heavily involved in the ad marketplace. In fact, advertising services were Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter, increasing 27% year over year.\n\nMeta's ad division also put up solid growth figures in Q4, with its ad revenue rising 24% year over year. Alphabet was the laggard of the trio, but this also makes sense due to its sheer size. It delivered an 11% growth rate in Q4.\n\nSo why are these growth rates a big deal? Well, if you rewind the clock to this time last year, these rates weren't nearly as impressive (besides Amazon). The ad market struggled in early 2023 due to fears of a recession. When businesses are concerned about a potential economic downfall, they save on whatever expenses they can. One of the easiest places to trim is ad budgets, which negatively affects businesses like Meta and Alphabet, which are highly concentrated in this industry.\n\nHowever, the fear of imminent recession has subsided, so businesses are happy to begin increasing their ad budgets. This is why ad-heavy companies like Meta and Alphabet have seen success recently.\n\nAmazon is a different story, as their ad revenue growth never dipped like Alphabet's or Meta's. This is likely due to the relatively young age of Amazon's ad business and that it's still working on building out its capabilities. When this segment matures, it will likely display the cyclical trends that the other two do, but it's in full growth mode right now.\n\nWith the ad market improving each quarter, all three companies stand to benefit, making them excellent buys.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks are still attractive buys\n\nIn addition to a recovering ad market, these three are some of the most attractively priced Magnificent Seven stocks. My valuation metric of choice for Alphabet and Meta is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the trailing 12 months used in the more common trailing P/E ratio still includes some quarters where the ad business was down. If you use this metric, it's clear these two are fairly priced. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWe can use Amazon's forward P/E (it's at 44), but that isn't fair to the business as portions of the company (like its international commerce division) aren't profitable and aren't expected to become fully profitable for some time. As a result, I'll use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to value Amazon. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nFrom this perspective, Amazon still has a way to go before being valued at the same levels as 2018 through 2021. So, investors can confidently buy the stock, knowing that it still isn't back to historical valuation norms.\n\nAdvertising is a great business to be in right now, which makes this trio a fantastic pick in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff admits he'd ‘be a lot richer’ if he'd just invested in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "Magnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical Moment",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech earnings arrive next week, right in time for investors looking for an artificial intelligence-powered rebound in the slumping S&P 500 Index, which just suffered through its worst week in over a year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Tesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD Software The Fed’s Forecasting Method Looks Increasingly Outdated as Bernanke Pitches an Alternative Elon Musk’s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into Chaos\n\nMicrosoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Tesla Inc., all of which are among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants, will report next week. Technology stocks are selling off, with the Nasdaq 100 Index registering its biggest weekly drop since November 2022 in the midst of a four-week losing streak, its longest since December 2022. Even AI darling Nvidia Corp. is getting hit, plunging 10% on Friday and wiping out $212 billion in market value for its worst day since the Covid pandemic in March 2020.\n\nBut hope is on the horizon. Profits for the Mag Seven — which also includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia — are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nAround 178 S&P 500 companies — representing more than 40% of the index’s market capitalization — will post results next week. But the biggest expectations are for megacap tech firms. The problem is, when excluding Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for AI technology, expected net income growth for the group falls to 23%, and the AI plans get squishier. Nvidia, which Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk dubbed “the most important stock on planet Earth,” doesn’t report its earnings for another month.\n\n“Nvidia is the company that is actually putting up and surpassing estimates, but for tech as a whole, especially if there’s an AI theme, investors have become a bit more discerning when it comes to profits,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “Investors want to see that companies are actually starting to see growth from AI, or at least that they have a credible plan to grow through AI.”\n\nSeeping Skepticism\n\nThat skepticism is seeping into the prices of the world’s largest tech stocks. While they’ve been responsible for the bulk of this year’s equity market gains, they’ve shed more than $930 billion in value since the Nasdaq 10O peaked last month, as traders raise bets that interest rates will stay higher for longer.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will read the first tea leaves Tuesday, when Tesla delivers results after the market closes. Meta will report on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet Thursday. Apple and Amazon will open their books the following week. Nvidia reports on May 22.\n\nMeta is the standout of next week’s group, with shares up about 36% this year, compared with gains of around 10% for Alphabet, 6% for Microsoft and Tesla’s near 41% collapse. The Facebook parent is expected to show revenue growth of 26% this quarter and almost double the net earnings from a year ago. It has been heavily investing in AI to improve ad targeting and recommend content to its massive user base.\n\nMicrosoft is also expected to benefit from AI, which its has been implementing its Copilot AI assistant into its products, including Office and its GitHub coding platform. Last quarter, demand for AI products fueled growth in its key Azure cloud-services business, and it’s expected to deliver more than 15% growth on the top and bottom lines this time.\n\n“There are reasons to be optimistic that because of AI, Microsoft’s growth can be higher than it would normally be,” said Michael Nell, a senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management, whose firm also owns shares of Nvidia and Amazon. “It has already been delivering higher growth.”\n\nOn the flipside is Alphabet, which is facing skepticism about its AI plans after some high-profile missteps. Plus, the integration of AI into other search engines like Bing is putting Google on the defensive. The company’s past two reports have been met with sizable selloffs, and any disappointment could reinforce the narrative that it’s falling behind. Still, net earnings are expected to rise more than 30% this quarter, with revenue up almost 14%, a reflection of the durability of big tech’s growth drivers.\n\nTrend Reversing\n\n“There’s been a recovery in cloud computing, and the start of an online ad cycle, which will benefit from the big political event later this year, as well as the ads frontrunning the Olympics — and of course, most significantly, you have AI,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team. “Its hard to deny that the momentum in tech continues.”\n\nWhen excluding the Magnificent Seven, the rest of the S&P 500’s profits are projected to contract by 3.9%. But Wall Street expects this trend to reverse as the year progresses. In the first quarter of 2025, those seven firms are expected to post earnings growth of 17.5% compared with nearly 18% for the rest of the S&P 500, BI data show.\n\nHowever, the year-over-year metrics are being distorted by so-called base effects — the impact of comparing quarterly profits against what happened a year ago. So while Big Tech’s profit growth appears to be narrowing in the coming year, much of that is due to tough comparisons from 2023. They’re still generating strong growth and generating healthy margins after aggressive cost-cutting efforts in the past year.\n\nBig tech is crucial to the S&P 500 since the companies carry the heaviest weightings in the benchmark. After this year’s advance, valuations have gotten lofty. Even with the latest selloff, the Magnificent Seven still trade at a combined 31 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“The bar is pretty high,” said Matt Peron, global head of solutions at Janus Henderson Investors. “The question is, are we at the point where nothing besides a very fantastic beat will be enough to continue driving stocks higher? There could be some disappointments relative to expectations, though I don’t think the earnings story will take down the market too much, unless the outlooks are really bad.”\n\n--With assistance from Joshua Gaunt-Warner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation China’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The ghosts of ‘Wintel’: What leaders can learn from the diverging paths that made Microsoft a $3 trillion powerhouse and flatlined Intel",
        "content": "Steve Jobs wasn’t accustomed to hearing “no.” But that was the answer from Paul Otellini, CEO of Intel.\n\nIt was 2006, and Intel, the global king of computer chips, was bringing in record revenue and profits by dominating the kinds of chips in hottest demand—for personal computers and data centers. Now Jobs wanted Intel to make a different type of chip for a product that didn’t even exist, which would be called the iPhone.\n\nOtellini knew chips for phones and tablets were the next big thing, but Intel had to devote substantial capital and its best minds to the fabulously profitable business it already possessed. Besides, “no one knew what the iPhone would do,” he told The Atlantic seven years later, just before he stepped down as CEO. “There was a chip that they were interested in, that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more, and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn’t see it.”\n\nOtellini, who died in 2017, was a highly successful CEO by many measures. But if that decision had gone the other way, Intel might have become a chip titan of the post-PC era.  Instead, it gave up on phone chips in 2016 after losing billions trying to become a significant player. As he left the company, Otellini seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision: “The world would have been a lot different if we’d done it.” UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 07: The IBM Personal Computer System was introduced to the market in early 1981, at a time when IBM was the world's largest mainframe computer manufacturer. Such was IBM's reputation that 200,000 of the PCs were sold in the first year. As a result it set a standard by which every other computer company was to be measured. The microcomputer market had grown from its beginnings in the kit building hobby market to a potential billion-dollar industry. The IBM PC used the Intel 8088 microprocessor, a factor which was also pivotal to Intel's growing success. The machine used magnetic tape to load data, and featured an optional floppy disk drive. The hard drive did not make an appearance until the release of IBM's XT machine in 1983. (Photo by SSPL/Getty Images)\n\nMeantime, some 800 miles north, in Seattle, Microsoft was struggling to find its role in a tech world dominated by the internet, mobile devices, social media, and search. Investors were not impressed by its efforts. No one could have foreseen that years later, a few key decisions would set the company up as an AI powerhouse and send its stock soaring.\n\nThere was a time not so long ago that Microsoft and Intel were both atop the tech world. They were neither competitors nor significant customers of each other, but what New York University’s Adam Brandenburger and Yale’s Barry Nalebuff deemed “complementors.” Microsoft built its hugely profitable Windows operating system over the years to work on computers that used Intel’s chips, and Intel designed new chips to run Windows (hence “Wintel”). The system fueled the leading tech product of the 1990s, the personal computer. Microsoft’s Bill Gates became a celebrity wonk billionaire, and Intel CEO Andy Grove was Time’s 1997 Man of the Year.\n\nSince then their paths have diverged sharply. Microsoft in 2000 was the world’s most valuable company, and after losing that distinction for many years, it’s No. 1 again. Intel was the world’s sixth most valuable company in 2000 and the largest maker of semiconductors; today it’s No. 69 by value and No. 2 in semiconductors by revenue, far behind No. 1 TSMC (and in some years also behind Samsung).\n\nStory continues Chart shows Microsoft and Intel stock prices since 1990\n\nA Fortune 500 CEO makes thousands of decisions in a career, a few of which will turn out to be momentous. What’s easy to explain in hindsight—that Microsoft would be at the forefront of AI, that Google would become a behemoth, that Blockbuster would fade into obscurity—is never preordained. Often the fateful decisions are identifiable only in retrospect. Nothing more vividly illustrates this than the parallel stories of Microsoft and Intel. The case study of what went right and wrong at those two giant corporations offers a master class in business strategy not just for today’s front-runners at the likes of Google, Open AI, Amazon, and elsewhere—but also for any Fortune 500 leader hoping to survive and thrive in the coming decade.\n\nWintel’s origin story\n\nThe two companies were founded a mere seven years apart. Intel’s founders in 1968 included Robert Noyce, coinventor of the computer chip, and Gordon Moore, who had written the seminal article observing that the number of transistors on a chip doubled every year, which he later revised to two years—Moore’s law, as others later called it. Andy Grove was employee No. 3. All three are still regarded as giants of the industry.\n\nBill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard to cofound Microsoft with Paul Allen, a childhood friend. They were excited by the prospects of creating software for a new concept, the personal computer, also called a microcomputer. They launched Microsoft in 1975. Gates cover: July 21, 1986 Grove cover: February 17, 1997 Joba and Gates cover: August 26, 1991\n\nThe two companies’ paths crossed when IBM decided in 1980 to produce a PC and wanted to move fast by using existing chips and an existing operating system developed by others. It chose Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s operating system, profoundly transforming both companies and the people who ran them. IBM’s size and prestige made its design the industry standard, so that virtually all PCs, regardless of manufacturer, used the same Intel chips and Microsoft operating system for decades thereafter. As PCs swept America and the world, Intel and Microsoft became symbols of technology triumphant, glamour, success, and the historic bull market of 1982 to 2000.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nThe reign of Gates and Grove peters out\n\nIn October, 2000, Fortune ran an article with an illustration depicting Gates and Grove as monumental Egyptian sphinxes. The headline: “Their Reign Is Over.”\n\nThe reasoning: “Gates and Grove attained hegemony by exploiting a couple of key choke points in computer architecture—the operating system and the PC microprocessor,” the article explained. “But in the new, more diverse IT world wired together by universal internet protocols, there are no such obvious choke points to commandeer.”\n\nThus began a multiyear identity crisis for both companies. Intel’s PC chips and Microsoft’s PC operating system and applications remained bountifully profitable businesses, but both companies and their investors knew those were not the future. So what was? And who would lead this new era?\n\nIn January of 2000, Gates stepped down as CEO after 25 years, and Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s president and a college friend of Gates, took his place; Gates remained chairman. Two days later, Microsoft’s stock rocket ran out of fuel. On that day the company’s market value hit $619 billion, a level it would not reach again for almost 18 years.\n\nGrove was no longer Intel’s CEO in 2000, having handed the job to Craig Barrett, a longtime company executive, in 1998. But as Intel’s visionary and most successful CEO, Grove remained an important presence as chairman of the board. His health was becoming an issue; he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995, and in 2000 he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Intel’s stock roared until August, when the company’s market value peaked at $500 billion. It has never reached that level since.\n\nBut most significantly, 2000 was the year that the internet began to seem like it just might make Wintel irrelevant.\n\nAt Intel, Barrett responded with acquisitions, many of which were in telecommunications and wireless technology. In concept, that made great sense. Cell phones were going mainstream, and they required new kinds of chips. “Craig tried to very aggressively diversify Intel by acquiring his way into new businesses,” says David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor who was on Intel’s board of directors at the time. “I would say that was not his skill set, and 100% of those acquisitions failed. We spent $12 billion, and the return was zero or negative.”\n\nIn the lean years after the dotcom balloon popped, Barrett continued to invest billions in new chip factories, known as fabs, and in new production technologies, so Intel would be well positioned when demand rebounded. That is a hint to one of the most important lessons of the Wintel saga and beyond: Protecting the incumbent business, even in a time of transition, is almost impossible to resist. That course usually sounds reasonable, but it holds the danger of starving the company’s future. As the great management writer Peter Drucker said: “If leaders are unable to slough off yesterday, to abandon yesterday, they simply will not be able to create tomorrow.”\n\n‘We screwed it up’\n\nAt Microsoft in the 2000s, “it was not at all obvious what would happen with the shape and volume of PCs, with operating system margins, or the future of applications like Word or Excel,” says Ray Ozzie, a top-level Microsoft executive from 2005 to 2010. “There was significant internal debate at Microsoft and in the industry on whether, in the future, the PC was dead, or if it would continue to grow and thrive.” Maybe Word, Excel, and those other applications that resided on your hard drive would move to the internet, like Google Docs, introduced in early 2006. In that case Microsoft would need a new business model. Should it develop one? Some executives thought so. But no one knew for sure.\n\nDuring this period, Microsoft was hardly a model of corporate innovation, and succumbed to what often happens when successful companies are disrupted. Ozzie explains: “When you are rolling in resources and there are multiple existential threats, the most natural action to protect the business is to create parallel efforts. It’s more difficult to make a hard opinionated choice and go all in. Unfortunately, by creating parallel efforts, you create silos and internal conflict, which can be dysfunctional.”\n\nAs competing teams fought for primacy, Microsoft missed the two most supremely profitable businesses since the PC era: search and cell phones. Those misses were not fatal because Microsoft still had two reliable, highly profitable businesses: the Windows operating system and the Office suite of apps. But in Drucker’s terms, those were yesterday businesses. Investors didn’t see substantial tomorrow businesses, which is why the stock price went essentially nowhere for years. Missing search and cell phones didn’t threaten Microsoft’s existence, but it threatened Microsoft’s relevance and importance in a changing world, which could eventually damage the company’s appeal among investors and the world’s best employees. The reasons for those crucial misses are instructive.\n\nIn 2000 Google was an insignificant internet search startup with no clear business model, but it had an inkling that selling advertising could be profitable. We know how that turned out: Google’s 2023 ad revenue was $238 billion. The model was entirely foreign to Microsoft, which made tons of money by creating software and selling it at high prices. Charging users nothing? Selling ads? Microsoft had never run a business at all like Google’s. By the time Google’s model had proved itself, Microsoft was hopelessly far behind. Today its Bing search engine has a 3% market share across all platforms worldwide, says the StatCounter web-traffic analysis firm. Google’s share is 92%. Google founders Sergey Brin, left and Larry Page , right, are shown at the companies headquarters in Mountaint View, Calif., Thursday March 13, 2003.

The company assumed the cell phone industry would develop much like the PC industry, in which sellers like Dell combined Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s software in a final product. But Apple’s starkly different iPhone business model, in which it designs its own chips and writes its own software, was an enormous hit. The other big winner in the industry, Google’s Android smartphone operating system, likewise ignored the PC model. Instead of selling its operating system, Google gives it away to phone makers like Samsung and Motorola. Google makes money by putting its search engine on every phone and by charging app makers a fee when users buy apps.\n\nBill Gates acknowledges that Microsoft’s miss in cell phones was life-changing for the company. Looking back on his career in 2020, he said: “It’s the biggest mistake I made in terms of something that was clearly within our skill set.”\n\nIntel also lost the mammoth cell phone opportunity, and in a similar way. It couldn’t adapt. Intel understood the opportunity and was supplying chips for the highly popular BlackBerry phone in the early 2000s. The trouble was, Intel hadn’t designed the chips. They were designed by Arm, a British firm that designs chips but doesn’t manufacture them. Arm had developed a chip architecture that used less power than other chips, a critical feature in a cell phone. Intel was manufacturing the chips and paying a royalty to Arm.

(Photo By Liz Hafalia/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nUnderstandably, Intel preferred to make phone chips with its own architecture, known as x86. Paul Otellini decided to stop making Arm chips and to create an x86 chip for cell phones—in retrospect, “a major strategic error,” says Yoffie. “The plan was that we would have a competitive product within a year, and we ended up not having a competitive product within a decade,” he recalls. “It wasn’t that we missed it. It was that we screwed it up.”\n\nGroping for a megatrend\n\nJust as 2000 was a turning point for Intel and Microsoft, so was 2013. Broadly they were in the same fix: still raking in money from the businesses that made them great; getting into the next big opportunities too late or unsuccessfully; groping for a megatrend they could dominate. Their stock prices had more or less flatlined for at least a decade. Then, in May 2013, Paul Otellini stepped down as Intel’s CEO. In August, Steve Ballmer announced he would step down as Microsoft’s CEO.\n\nSuccession is the board of directors’ No. 1 job, more important than all its other jobs combined. The stakes are always high. How the Intel and Microsoft boards handled their successions, nine months apart, largely explains why the two companies’ storylines have diverged so dramatically.\n\nUnder Otellini’s successor, Brian Krzanich, Intel kept missing new-chip deadlines—ironically failing to keep up with Moore’s law even as competitors did so—and lost market share. The company gave up on smartphone chips. After five years as CEO, Krzanich resigned abruptly when an investigation found he had had a consensual relationship with an employee. CFO Bob Swan stepped in as CEO, and the production troubles continued until, by 2021, for the first time in Intel’s existence, its chips were two generations behind competitors’. Those competitors were Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.\n\nIn crisis mode, Intel’s board brought back Pat Gelsinger, an engineer who had spent 30 years at Intel before leaving for 11 years to be a high-level executive at EMC and then CEO of VMware. As Intel’s CEO he has announced an extraordinarily ambitious and expensive plan to reclaim the company’s stature as the world leader in chip technology.\n\nMicrosoft’s board spent almost six months finding Ballmer’s successor under worldwide scrutiny. At least 17 candidates were publicly speculated upon. British and Las Vegas bookies offered odds on the eventual winner; Satya Nadella, who recently marked 10 years as CEO, was a 14-to-1 long shot.\n\nNadella has arguably been the best corporate succession choice, regardless of industry, in years or perhaps decades. Under his leadership the stock finally broke out of its 14-year trading range and shot upward, rising over 1,000%. Microsoft again became the world’s most valuable company, recently worth $3.1 trillion. Gelsinger, with just over three years in the job, can’t be fully evaluated; industry experts wonder if he’ll be Intel’s Nadella. But both CEOs offer useful examples of how to move a company from the past to the future.\n\nNadella orchestrated Microsoft’s dramatic turnaround by taking an outsider’s look at the company and making big changes with little drama. He began by making Office apps (Word, Excel) compatible with Apple iPhones and iPads—heresy at Microsoft, which regarded Apple as an archenemy. But Nadella realized the two companies competed very little, and why not let millions more people rely on Office apps? The move sent a message to the company and the world: The Microsoft culture’s endemic arrogance would be dialed down considerably. Interoperating with other companies could now be okay.\n\nThat was largely a new business model at the company, with many more to follow. For example, Nadella bought LinkedIn, a player in social media, which Microsoft had entirely missed, and later bought GitHub, a repository of open-source code, which Microsoft had previously despised. Both deals and several others have been standout successes.\n\nMore broadly, Nadella brought a new leadership style for a new environment. In a company known for vicious infighting that could paralyze action, he settled long-running debates over major projects. For example, in 2016 he sold the Nokia cell phone business that Microsoft had bought a year before he became CEO, acknowledging that the company had lost the battle for phones. “People don’t quite grok why things have blossomed under Satya,” says a former executive. “His superpower is to make a choice, eliminate conflict, and let the business blossom.”\n\nAt Intel, Gelsinger also introduced culture-defying changes. The company had risen to dominance by designing leading-edge chips and manufacturing them with industry-leading skill. Amid that intense pride, the idea of creating a separate foundry business—manufacturing chips designed by others—was anathema. Yet under Gelsinger, Intel has created a new foundry business while also relying more on other foundries, including TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker, for some of its own chips—a double shock to the culture.\n\nGetting a long-established company with a titanium-strength culture to adopt seemingly strange business models as Nadella and Gelsinger did can be painfully hard. Often only a new CEO can bring the openness necessary to make it happen. The same problem arises when a company needs to update its corporate strategy. Microsoft had been seeking and debating the next big thing for years, but Nadella saw that the company didn’t need to find a potentially huge new future-facing business. It already had one: Azure, its cloud computing service. Amazon Web Services was and is the industry leader, but Azure has grown to a strong No. 2 because Nadella has given it abundant capital and some of the company’s brightest workers. He also made an unorthodox investment in OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, commiting $13 billion to the company starting before it was famous. Now Azure offers its customers OpenAI technology. In Drucker’s terms, it’s a big, thriving tomorrow business.\n\nGelsinger changed Intel’s strategy even more radically. He bet heavily and successfully on billions of dollars from the U.S. government. Via the CHIPS and Science Act, Intel could receive up to $44 billion in aid for new U.S. chip factories the company is building in coming years. “As I like to joke, no one has spent more shoe leather on the CHIPS Act than yours truly,” he tells Fortune. “I saw an awful lot of senators, House members, caucuses in the different states. It’s a lot to bring it across the line.”\n\nA key insight is that for a major company with a history of success, like Microsoft and Intel, moving beyond an outmoded strategy and fully embracing a new one is traumatically difficult and sometimes impossible. For years both companies tried and failed to do it. A related insight: Doing it is easier for Nadella and Gelsinger because they have the advantage of being “insider outsiders,” leaders with deep knowledge of their organization but without heavy investment in its strategy; Nadella was working on Azure, not the Windows operating system or Office apps, long before he became CEO, and Gelsinger’s 11-year absence from Intel gave him license to rethink everything.\n\nA larger lesson is that, in the stories of these two great companies, succession is the most important factor. Considering that Microsoft on the whole has fared better than Intel over the past 24 years, it’s significant that over that period, Microsoft has had only two CEOs and Intel has had five. Most people study the CEO when explaining a company’s performance, but they should first examine those who choose the CEO, the board of directors.\n\nLooking back at these stories, asking “what if” is irresistible. What if Paul Otellini had said yes to Steve Jobs? What if any of Intel’s or Microsoft’s CEOs had been someone else? What if Intel, under a different CEO, had developed a successful GPU, the kind of chip that powers today’s AI engines (it tried)—would you ever have heard of Nvidia? Bill Gates said in 2019, “We missed being the dominant mobile operating system by a very tiny amount.” What if that tiny amount had shifted slightly? Whose phone would you be using today?\n\nIt’s all endlessly tantalizing but of course unknowable. The value of looking back and asking “what if,” is to remind us that every day leaders are creating the future—and neglecting their duty if they don’t learn from the past.\n\n5 lessons from the Wintel case study:\n\n1.Success can be a company’s worst enemy. The great management writer Peter Drucker said every company must “abandon yesterday” before it can “create tomorrow.” But in a successful company, every incentive pushes leaders to protect yesterday. Intel and Microsoft struggled for years to create their tomorrows.\n\n2. Leaders must be open to business models that seem strange. Whether giving away software or manufacturing chips designed by others as a separate business, both Microsoft and Intel faced competitors doing things differently.\n\n3. Get everyone on the same page. Debate is healthy up to a point, but at Microsoft it continued far too long until Nadella became CEO and set clear priorities. At Intel a series of CEOs backed differing solutions to its declining business, which prolonged a muddled strategy.\n\n4. Succession is the board’s No. 1 job, more important than all its other jobs combined. Everyone knows it, but some boards still do their job poorly. If they make a mistake, none of the other lessons matter. Considering that Microsoft has come through the past 24 years better than Intel, it may be significant that Microsoft has had only two CEOs in that period while Intel has had five.\n\n5. Failure isn’t fatal. The Wintel story is a pointed reminder that all companies, including the best, suffer failures and fall into crises. There are no exceptions. The leaders of any company, even the grandest, must always be ready to engage the skills of organizational rescue, and know that even that can be part of greatness.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Friday said it will roll back requirements that U.S. suppliers and staffing firms pay their employees at least $15 an hour and provide health insurance and other benefits, a move that could allow the tech giant to avoid bargaining with unions.\n\nThe elimination of the 2019 policy, along with other steps such as limiting access by temporary workers and vendors to internal systems, are designed to comply with shifting U.S. and global labor regulations related to contingent workers, a spokesperson for Mountain View, California-based Google told Reuters.\n\n\"These updates bring us in line with other large companies and simply clarify that Google is not, and has never been, the employer of our suppliers’ employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe announcement comes after the U.S. National Labor Relations Board in January ruled that Google was a so-called \"joint employer\" of workers provided by staffing firm Cognizant Technology Solutions and must bargain with their union. Google is appealing that decision.\n\nThe board relied in part on the 2019 policy, saying it allowed Google to exert control over the workers even though it does not employ them directly.\n\nThe labor board has moved to make it more difficult for companies to avoid bargaining with temporary and contract workers, including adopting a rule last year that said companies with indirect control over working conditions can be considered the employers of contract workers. A federal judge blocked the rule from taking effect in March.\n\nThe Google spokesperson on Friday said the company will continue to enforce a supplier code of conduct that requires vendors and staffing firms to provide safe working conditions and meet existing legal obligations.\n\nMost of the company's suppliers operate in states that mandate a minimum wage of at least $15, the spokesperson said.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Louise Heavens)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google sacked 28 employees following anti-Israel protests at its California office - X/Katejsim\n\nGoogle’s chief executive has told staff to leave their politics at home in a rebuke to employees who have campaigned against its work with the Israeli government.\n\nSundar Pichai said that the office was not a place “to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics” amid fierce disagreements between its employees.\n\nThe edict marks a decisive shift from Google, which has long been seen as a beacon of a collegiate Silicon Valley culture encouraging political debate.\n\nGoogle once told employees to “bring their whole selves to work” and supported widespread political discussions on its internal discussion boards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the policy has threatened to backfire in recent years as the company has been rocked by a string of employee protests over defence contracts and gender inequality. Google workers staged a sit-in over the company's work with Israel - X/MPower_Change\n\nOn Wednesday Google sacked 28 staff who had staged a protest at the company’s offices objecting to its work for the Israeli government.\n\n“[We] need to be more focused in how we work, collaborate, discuss and even disagree,” Mr Pichai wrote in an email to employees.\n\n“We have a culture of vibrant, open discussion that enables us to create amazing products and turn great ideas into action. That’s important to preserve. But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.\n\n“This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.\n\n“When we come to work, our goal is to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. That supersedes everything else and I expect us to act with a focus that reflects that.”\n\nOn Tuesday, employees staged a sit in at the company’s Silicon Valley and New York offices, wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan “Googler against genocide” and occupying the office of Thomas Kurian, the head of its cloud computing division.\n\nStory continues\n\nNine were arrested after refusing to leave.\n\nGoogle sells cloud computing and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli military as part of a $1.2bn (£1bn) programme called Project Nimbus. The company has said it merely provides “generally available cloud computing services” to the project.\n\nAddressing the protests on Wednesday, Google’s head of security Chris Rackow said the protests were “unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened”.\n\nGoogle has gradually sought to crack down on fractious political debates in recent years. It recently made changes to its internal messaging tool to limit rows about the war in Gaza and discouraged political discussions during meetings.\n\nIt has come amid increasing protests over the company’s more controversial work, including an AI contract for the US military and a secret project to build a censored Chinese search engine, both of which have now been abandoned.\n\nThe company has also faced employee uprisings over how it treats women and over mass redundancies.\n\nIn 2017, it sacked an engineer after he circulated a memo arguing against Google’s efforts to close the gender gap.\n\nMr Pichai’s directive underlines a shift in Silicon Valley, where companies have often sought to foster a “mission driven culture”.\n\nIn 2020, the cryptocurrency company Coinbase said it would not allow discussions of politics and social issues at work, offering staff payoffs if they quit over the policy. The move was controversial at the time, with executives including Twitter’s then chief Jack Dorsey publicly criticising it and dozens of staff leaving.\n\nOther tech giants including Facebook’s parent company Meta have sought to limit political discussions at work.\n\nGoogle has recently faced criticism after its Gemini chatbot produced diverse images of Nazi soldiers and Vikings. Its founder Sergey Brin admitted that the chatbot “leans Left in many cases”.",

        "title": "Will Alphabet (GOOG) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.70%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Alphabet came out with earnings of $1.64 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 per share, representing a surprise of 2.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.55 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.90%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Alphabet lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.

        "title": "Will Alphabet (GOOGL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Alphabet (GOOGL), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this internet search leader has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.70%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Alphabet was expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share, but it reported $1.64 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.50%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.45 per share, while it actually produced $1.55 per share, a surprise of 6.90%.\n\nFor Alphabet, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +1.43% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 best cheap phones for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Cheap Phones for 2024.\n\nOverview of the Global Smartphone Industry\n\nThe global smartphone industry is one of the fastest evolving industries and experiences regular updates and new smartphone devices to boost user experience and utility. According to a report by Mondor Intelligence, the global smartphone market was valued at $1.51 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.10% to reach $1.85 billion by 2029.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region holds the greatest market share mainly due to its highly developing telecommunication infrastructure and large customer base. Some of the leading countries with the most sophisticated technology infrastructure in the region include India, Indonesia, Japan, Australia, China, and South Korea. On April 5, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in collaboration with Indonesia’s telecommunication firm, PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison Tbk (IDX:ISAT), plans to invest $200 million in 2024 to build an artificial intelligence center in Surakarta, Indonesia. The AI center is expected to further boost Indonesia's technology infrastructure and include a human resource center.

According to a report by Forbes, tech experts expect future smartphones to have cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to holographic displays, universal wireless charging, improved integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and enhanced health tracking.\n\nThe Tug of War Between Samsung and Apple\n\nThe global smartphone market is witnessing intense competition between Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to secure the highest smartphone sales market share. Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) has led the smartphone market for over 12 years. However, in the fiscal 4th quarter of 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the top position in the market for the first time in over a decade. The company held 23% of the global smartphone shipment market by shipping approximately 74.0 million phones in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) global smartphone shipments grew by 3.7% from 2022 to 2023 against a drop of 13.6% for Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) during the same year. However, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could not secure the top position as the company's market share went down drastically to 17.3% in the first quarter of 2024. According to a report by The Guardian, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) global shipment of iPhones went down from 55.4 million to 50.1 million during the first quarter of 2024. This steep drop in sales of iPhones has been the biggest ever since COVID-19 and is mainly due to the Chinese government's ban on foreign devices. Apple Inc.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +5.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.77 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $66.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $286.38 billion and $318.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +11.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "Even though the broader market recently set new all-time highs (measured by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100) within the past month, there are still plenty of buying opportunities within the stock market.\n\nI've identified three stocks that look like great buys, and you should consider these for your next investment.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a giant in many industries. The Google family of products has long been successful, with the search engine still dominating the global market share despite competitors introducing generative AI-powered options.\n\nIt also has a thriving cloud computing business, a product line that is vital as artificial intelligence (AI) grows. About 70% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth more than $1 billion) utilize Google Cloud, which shows that it is the platform of choice for any company looking to create an AI model on the cloud.\n\nEven though Alphabet notched a new all-time high just a few days ago, I still think it looks attractive at these levels.\n\nWhen Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is considered, the stock doesn't look too pricey. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt just under 23 times forward earnings, it's slightly more expensive than the S&P 500, which trades at 21.3 times forward earnings. Furthermore, compared to other \"Magnificent Seven\" members, it also looks cheap.\n\nCompany Forward P/E Microsoft 35.4 Apple 26.3 Nvidia 34.5 Amazon 43.7 Tesla 58.1 Meta Platforms 25\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nWith Alphabet still performing well and much cheaper than its big tech peers, I think it's a no-brainer buy right now.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is a powerhouse in Latin America. It has a thriving e-commerce and logistics business (similar to Amazon) but also has elements like digital payments and consumer credit. Essentially, if it's vital for e-commerce to occur, then MercadoLibre likely has its hand in it.\n\nIt has also been growing at an unbelievable pace, with net revenue increasing by a currency-neutral 83% in the fourth quarter to $4.3 billion. It's also improving its profitability, which faltered while MercadoLibre quickly expanded to secure new opportunities. MELI Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAlthough its profit margin dipped to around 4% this quarter, if not for a one-time charge, it would have been 9%. Even with strong success, MercadoLibre's stock has had a poor 2024, with it down nearly 10% this year. This pullback has also caused its price-to-sales (P/S) valuation to drop to historically low levels. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nAs a result of MercadoLibre's strong business and sizable pullback, I think right now is an excellent time to buy some shares of MercadoLibre.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. UiPath\n\nLastly, there is UiPath(NYSE: PATH). Its software is vital to implementing robotic process automation (RPA) tasks. When combined with AI, RPA allows its users to automate a significant number of repetitive tasks. By eliminating these workflows from employees, they can do other jobs that require original thinking, which makes companies more efficient and improves employee morale.\n\nUiPath has been quite successful, with its annual recurring revenue (ARR) rising 22% to $1.46 billion in Q4 of fiscal year 2024 (ended January 31). UiPath also converted around 4% of revenue into an operating profit. This will be a key metric to watch in future quarters, as it shows investors it's starting to value profits over its growth rate.\n\nStill, UiPath has a massive market opportunity ahead of it. Grand View Research projects the U.S. RPA market will expand from $2.9 billion in 2023 to $30.9 billion by 2030. As a major player in this industry already, UiPath has a ton of growth ahead of it.\n\nDespite that, UiPath's stock doesn't trade for a premium as many software companies do. PATH PS Ratio Chart\n\nAt just 8.4 times sales, UiPath is a reasonably priced software stock with strong growth. Because of that, I'm taking the downturn as an opportunity to buy more UiPath stock now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "EV Chipmakers Test Investor Faith After Missing Out on AI Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A waning electric vehicle market is dragging down shares of companies making chips for automobiles, with their limited exposure to AI excluding them from a broader rally. But analysts are urging long-term investors to keep the faith.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Israel Reported to Have Launched Retaliatory Strike on Iran Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding Oil Erases Advance After Iranian Media Downplays Israel’s Attack\n\nInfineon Technologies AG and STMicroelectronics NV, two bellwethers of the automotive chip industry, are each down more than 18% in 2024, placing them among the worst-performing tech stocks in Europe. US-listed NXP Semiconductors NV and Texas Instruments Inc. have lagged gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\nSigns of weaker EV demand are piling up, evidenced by shockingly low sales figures at Tesla Inc. Rising inventories and competition from Chinese chipmakers have added to the gloom. Still, bulls are mostly undeterred — Infineon and STMicro have only one sell recommendation between them.\n\n“We think they will weather the storm in the near term,” said Morningstar Inc. analyst Brian Colello, who rates both stocks as buy. “We think it’s a good entry point if you’re willing to hold these names for two to five years’ stretch.”\n\nThe number of chips used in cars has seen a sharp rise as automakers adopt electric motors and autonomous driving features. That growth is seen continuing as EVs become increasingly sophisticated, with Bernstein analysts forecasting chip content per car to go from $650 in 2021 to more than $1,500 by 2031.\n\nChina poses a potential risk in terms of competition. Bloomberg News reported in March that authorities have asked domestic EV makers including BYD Co. to source more chips from local providers, stoking concerns that the current suppliers, such as Infineon and STMicro, could lose market share.\n\nHowever, Chinese vendors are yet to prove their tech competency as their chip performance is far behind, according to Bernstein analysts led by Qingyuan Lin. And it’s not just a case of mastering manufacturing know-how, said Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson. Running operations at scale and achieving profitability can prove difficult as well, he added.\n\n“We believe a lot of bad news is already priced in here,” Simpson said. “In particular, the China market share erosion fears are overdone.”\n\nBoth Infineon and STMicro trade below 14 times forward earnings, levels that are lower than their respective five-year averages.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the US, NXP Semiconductors’ forward price-to-earnings multiple is more than 35% below that of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and peer ON Semiconductor Corp. trades at an even steeper discount. Texas Instruments ranks the priciest within the peer group.\n\nRead More: TSMC Has Only Bad News for Chipmakers Left Out of AI Boom\n\nA key risk to automotive chipmakers in the short term is excessive inventories at their clients, which have built up since the pandemic disrupted global supply chains. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Thursday scaled back its outlook for the auto chip segment, a move that Infineon could follow, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui.\n\nBut investors have already been expecting potential outlook cuts from these companies, said Wesley Lebeau, a fund manager at CPR Asset Management. As the year progresses, year-over-year comparisons will become easier for the auto chip sector and tougher for leading-edge chipmakers that saw shares soaring over AI optimism, he said.\n\nThe valuation discrepancy between the two groups makes automotive chipmakers “quite interesting opportunities for the second part of the year,” Lebeau said. “Overall, the electrification theme on the automotive industry is still valid.”\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApollo Global Management Inc. and Sony Group Corp. are considering a joint offer for Paramount Global, sparking a jump in shares of the film and TV giant as investors weigh the potential for a bidding war with technology mogul David Ellison. Netflix Inc. posted its best start to the year since 2020, attracting more new customers than anyone expected thanks to a strong slate of original programs and a crackdown on password sharing. Apple Inc. removed social media services including Meta Platforms Inc.’s WhatsApp and Threads from its Chinese app store, responding to orders from Beijing to close more loopholes in the country’s longstanding internet firewall. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced changes to Google’s workplace teams structure, saying the moves will help the company develop artificial intelligence products and services faster and more efficiently. ChatGPT developer OpenAI hired its first employee in India, appointing a government relations head just as the country votes in a new administration that will shape artificial intelligence regulations in the world’s most populous nation.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Google is harnessing AI to manage talent and cut costs—and what it means for consumers",
        "content": "Good morning. One way AI is affecting how businesses operate is when it comes to the finance function, and Google is no different.\n\nA memo sent to Google finance staffers by Alphabet and Google CFO Ruth Porat and seen by CNBC said the restructuring will affect teams worldwide. “The tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al,” Porat wrote. Google also plans to create “hubs” for centralized operations in Atlanta, Chicago, Mexico City, Bangalore, and Dublin. She ended the letter: \"We are sad to say goodbye to some talented teammates and friends we care about, and we know this change is difficult.”\n\nA Google spokesperson told me via email that the firm is “responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead.” Google didn't confirm the amount of finance-related job cuts, with the spokesperson instead saying: “Throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities.”\n\nBut investing further into emerging technologies like AI in 2024 does mean the company will “have to make tough choices,” according to an internal memo from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in January. That could mean some teams lose headcount. But Google isn’t the only big tech company readjusting personnel in the age of AI, which Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said is for the better.\n\n“This is a leaner and meaner Google that is now on the offensive around AI,” Ives told me. “There has been a lot of criticism of Google, and Sundar is taking a page out of the Meta playbook focused on efficiency and a new era of AI looking ahead. This is the right move at the right time for Google.”\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Pichai shared several structural changes to “improve velocity and execution across the company,” and one change is consolidating the teams that focus on building models across Research and Google DeepMind.\n\nAs Google cuts costs, “they're going to use this money to reinvest in bringing great products to customers even faster,” said Niccolo de Masi, chair of the Futurum Group, a technology research and advisory firm. “AI is a net job creator,” he told me.\n\nAccording to de Masi, also the former chairman and CEO of Glu Mobile, and the former CEO of dMY Technologies, AI's impact will be compared to ATMs and Excel spreadsheets, which “have grown the number of people that work in finance exponentially in the past 50 years.”\n\nAI will take care of mundane tasks, although higher-level expertise will still be required—at least in some capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Large companies may let go of bookkeepers, and consolidate higher-level expertise and supervision with machine learning,” de Masi continued.\n\nBig tech companies like Meta and Google, and others that have close to 100,000 employees, will be “net growers,” de Masi said. “And the stock market is obviously very bullish on their ability to grow, which means they will keep hiring and acquiring.”\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nMaría Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today’s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at ChatGPT Stock Predictions: 10 Stocks That Have 10X Potential. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our articleChatGPT Stock Predictions: 5 Stocks That Have 10X Potential.\n\nFrom taking customer service calls to composing music, AI has already started showing its prowess and impact all over the world. But can AI help investors in spotting potential multibaggers? Several reports show that hedge funds, venture capitalists and wise investors are using AI to their advantage. For example, California-based venture capital firm Sierra Ventures developed an AI software which would help the firm decide whether to invest in a startup. Talking to The Wall Street Journal, the firm's Managing Partner Mark Fernandes said that analysis from this software caused him pay attention to a promising startup that he would have otherwise ignored.\n\n\"If you think about the volume of deals coming in, I would’ve missed that,\" Fernandes said.\n\nHow Can AI Help Investors and Professional Stock Pickers?\n\nMike Wilson, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist & Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley, talked to Bloomberg about the impact of AI on businesses and his broader view on the economy. Wilson said that we are still in the early days of AI when it comes to the business world. He said that the \"real opportunity\" would be when AI is \"diffused\" to the economy and companies begin to adapt to AI technologies.  Wilson said so far the role of AI has been of an assistant rather than an enabler. But the power of AI in the investing world is fast becoming decisive as the technology helps companies make decisions potentially worth billions of dollars.\n\nIn the investing world, AI has been in action in some form over the past several years, as quant funds and high-performance trading firms rigorously used machine learning for sentiment analysis, finding patterns in stocks and predicting market movements. A research paper titled Artificial Intelligence applied to Stock Market Trading: A Review mentions several studies and academic researches describing the importance of using AI, machine learning and data-based predictive analysis in stock investing. For example, the research mentions a paper which analyzed stock returns when a data mining approach is incorporated where thousands of press releases from companies trading on NYSE and NSADAQ indices were processed.  The data-based analysis divided all press relapses in three categories: \"Good News,\" \"Bad News,\" and \"No Movers\" (for neutral news). The paper found out that good news result in significant stock jumps, while bad news cause stock dips. When this sentiment analysis is practiced, \"results show a recall of approximately 60% and a better cumulative return and average return per trade than the random trader in a stock market simulation.\" That's why in a world where data and AI-based analysis is the future, leaving everything to macro movements and randomness won't take an average investor far.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-based Sentiment Analysis on Stocks\n\nThe research paper also analyzed another study in which it pulled about 300,000 posts about Apple stock from investing-focused social media platform StockTwits during 2010-2017. Algorithms were then applied to perform sentiment analysis and compare it with historical price movements during this entire period (stock price data was pulled from Yahoo Finance).\n\n\"For sentiment prediction, the achieved test accuracy was 63.5%, 75.3% recall, and 76.8% precision, and for stock movement prediction, the completed test accuracy was 76.68%, 100% recall, and 69.5% precision,\" the research said. ChatGPT Stock Predictions: Stocks That Have 10X Potential\n\nPerformance and Returns of AI-Powered Funds and Indexes\n\nAmplify Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA: MJ) is up 18% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500 gain of just 4.5%. The fund, powered by IBM Watson platform, uses sentiment analysis, machine learning and quantum computing to process 10 years of historical data, millions of news articles and data points to analyze securities.  Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, an equally weighted index of 11 constituent funds using artificial intelligence and machine learning theory in their trading processes, is up 3.9% in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we asked ChatGPT to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff data, that have the potential to grow 10X in the next few years. Here is our exact prompt:\n\n\"Wear the hat of a stock trader and financial expert and recommend  stocks based on your knowledge that have the potential to 10X in the next few years.\"\n\nAs expected, ChatGPT first gave fair warnings that investing in stocks have risks and no one could say with certainty which stocks would grow ten times their current value in the future. But ChatGPT recommended 15 stocks based on  \"historical trends\" and the \"market landscape\" from various sectors which have \"substantial\" potential over the next few years. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of the end of 2023. Some top names in the list include Alphabet Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nDon't Miss: ChatGPT's Recent Stock Recommendations\n\n10.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA has literally emerged as the market's collective play on the outlook for artificial intelligence; the stock is up +72.7% this year vs. +7.8% for the Zacks Tech sector and +5.6% for the S&P 500 index. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for GPU’s have resulted in the company’s stocks skyrocketing. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, while it is also leaving giant imprints on the Gaming and ProViz end markets.\n\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nAlphabet shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the last six months (+12.9% vs. +14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Alphabet’s sluggish network advertisement business have been casting a cloud over its prospects. Also, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\n\nYet, expanding data centers, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities and deepening focus on the wearables category remain major tailwinds. The company’s efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry as well as autonomous driving space also gives cause for optimism.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-10.9% vs. +15.6%). Per the Zacks analyst, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue to ail. The company faces the upcoming patent expiration of Stelara. Though it has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, uncertainty regarding the talc litigations persists.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, its Innovative Medicine Unit is outdoing the markets currently, and the MedTech unit is is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These Are the 3 Tech Stocks Billionaires Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Technology stocks have been in high demand over the past year or so, driving the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite to new heights. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to lead that charge higher.\n\nLike many investors, billionaires are intrigued by the potential to profit from these next-generation algorithms and have piled into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. Recent research by The Motley Fool shines a light on the most popular technology stocks held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to almost no one that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is near the top of the list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in facilitating AI processing, leading to triple-digit revenue and profit gains last year and headlines galore. What they might find surprising, however, is that two AI tech stocks are owned by more hedge funds, while another is neck and neck with Nvidia.\n\nLet's look at the three tech stocks -- not named Nvidia -- that are most widely held by billionaire hedge fund managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires' Favorite Tech Stocks\n\nResearchers at The Motley Fool examined 16 hedge funds that are run by billionaires to ascertain what some of the wealthiest investors had in their portfolios. The data was obtained by reviewing each of the funds' fourth-quarter 2023 13F forms -- the quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of each quarter. The report discloses their portfolio holdings.\n\nThe study then compiled a list of the technology stocks that appeared in the top-10 holdings of more than one of the hedge funds reviewed. And the results were telling.\n\nAlphabet: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). BlueCrest Capital Management (Michael Platt). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Soros Fund Management (George Soros). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company's dominant Google Search gives it access to a vast treasure trove of data, which is needed to adequately train generative AI models. Its search business also forms the foundation for its industry-leading, digital-advertising business, capturing roughly 30% of the market last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman, who is also a fan, detailed the reasoning behind Pershing Square Capital's large stake in Alphabet: \"We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model.\" He went on to cite the stock's compelling valuation -- which is still attractive -- currently trading at less than 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, making it one of the best bargains among AI tech stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms: A top-10 holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META)(NASDAQ: GOOG) also topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Renaissance Technologies (Jim Simons). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner). Viking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\n\nThe company boasts the world's most widely used family of social media platforms. About 3.2 billion people visit one of its sites every day, and 4 billion stop by monthly. This provides the company with a large horde of data. Meta surprised tech aficionados by developing its own Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is now available for hire on all the major cloud platforms, representing an entirely new revenue stream.\n\nIts AI chops aside, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates recently addressed some of the market's most popular tech stocks, saying he views \"Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap.\" Dalio has a point, and that might help explain Meta's popularity among the billionaire set. Meta is currently selling for about 25 times forward earnings, a discount compared to a current multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft: A top-10 holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was tied with Nvidia, a top holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires:\n\nCitadel (Ken Griffin). Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio). Millennium Management (Israel Englander). Tiger Global Management (Chase Coleman). E. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw). Tudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones). Coatue Management (Philippe Laffont). Two Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel). The Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn). Caxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\n\nWhile Microsoft's software offerings and recurring revenue are no doubt appealing, the company has a big catalyst directly tied to AI -- namely, its generative AI-powered assistant, Copilot, a suite of helpers deeply integrated into the company's most popular products and services.\n\nCopilot streamlines a growing list of otherwise time-consuming tasks, helping users to be more productive. In fact, the initial versions were so successful Microsoft is rolling out a number of job-specific Copilots geared toward the sales, customer service, and finance industries, which will likely enjoy similar success.\n\nWe don't yet know how much this program will add to Microsoft's sales, but the numbers will likely be significant. Billionaire Dan Loeb of Third Points suggests the introduction of Copilot \"could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027.\n\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft isn't nearly as cheap as the other two stocks in our trio, but consider this: The company already has a clear path to profit from AI, which could be lucrative.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $514,887!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Continue to Soar in 2024: My Top 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before the Surge Continues",
        "content": "After enduring one of its worst performances since 2008, the Nasdaq Composite has turned things around, gaining 50% since the beginning of last year. After such a sharp move higher, some investors wonder if much upside remains.\n\nYet a review of the data suggests the current market rally still has room to run. Since the storied index began trading back in 1972, every year after a market recovery begins, the tech-heavy index has risen 19%, on average. The ongoing battle with inflation is a wild card that could still throw a wrench in the works. That said, history suggests that 2024 should be a profitable year for investors.\n\nIt's generally agreed that recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have helped fuel the market's ascent and will likely drive additional gains in 2024. While estimates vary, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years, according to data compiled by McKinsey Global Institute. Companies at the cutting edge of AI will enjoy a veritable windfall.\n\nHere are my top five AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq climbs to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion regarding the potential for AI would be complete without a nod to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) is the gold standard for several AI use cases, including machine learning, cloud computing, and data centers -- and its processors have quickly become the go-to for generative AI. Demand has far exceeded supply, with the resulting chip shortage expected to persist until 2025. Competition is fierce, but Nvidia's decades of experience and significant spending on research and development have kept its rivals at bay.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) grew 126% and 586%, respectively. While no one expects its triple-digit gains to continue indefinitely, demand is expected to remain strong. Furthermore, while 34 times forward earnings might seem pricey, its growth illustrates why Nvida is deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was another company that was quick to capitalize on the generative AI opportunity. After years of toiling behind the scenes, it took a $13 billion stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and rolled out its Copilot suite of AI assistants. Copilot is deeply integrated into Microsoft's core offerings, streamlining time-consuming tasks and making workers more productive. A survey of early users found that once they tried Copilot, 77% said they \"didn't want to give it up.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNew versions are still being introduced. While estimates vary, some analysts believe Copilot could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue annually, which will be a boon to the company. Furthermore, Microsoft's Azure Cloud is gaining market share and attributing its accelerating growth to AI. At 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling for a premium compared to a multiple of 27 for the S&P 500, but that's pretty reasonable considering Microsoft's potential.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has been laboring in the field for more than 20 years, supplying AI-fueled data analytics to governments and enterprises alike. When AI went viral last year, the company met the challenge head-on, introducing its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which layers generative AI onto its already robust offerings.\n\nPalantir offers \"boot camps\" to identify mission-critical issues it can solve with AIP, and demand has been off the charts. The company planned to host 500 sessions in one year and blew past the goal in just four months. As a result, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 70% year over year and 12% sequentially, making it the company's fastest-growing business, and it's only just getting started.\n\nPalantir's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\n4. Super Micro Computer\n\nIt isn't just chips and software that are fueling the AI revolution. Most AI processing happens on cloud or data center servers, and that's where Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, comes in. The company works closely with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and others to develop cutting-edge servers that can withstand the rigors of AI processing. These close ties ensure that Supermicro servers are optimized to be AI workhorses while also focusing on energy efficiency.\n\nDemand is strong and the company is taking market share from its rivals. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), revenue grew 103% year over year while its adjusted EPS jumped 71%. Yet despite its impressive growth, Supermicro is selling for less than 3 times forward sales, a bargain when considered in the light of its opportunity.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has a long history of deploying AI to boost its search and digital advertising businesses. The company quickly deployed generative AI functionality into its core Google and Android products. Furthermore, the company is well positioned to offer generative AI models to its cloud customers via Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider.\n\nOne of its biggest opportunities is Gemini, which the company says is its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Furthermore, Google's Vertex AI platform provides 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps without having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nRecent advancements in AI will likely help fuel the recovery in Google's digital advertising business, and at less than 27 times earnings, Alphabet stock is a steal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $514,887!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google will combine the software division responsible for Android mobile software and the Chrome browser with the hardware division known for Pixel smartphones and Fitbit wearables, the company said Thursday. It's part of a broader plan to integrate artificial intelligence more widely throughout the company.\n\nIn a letter to employees, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the changes will “turbocharge the Android and Chrome ecosystems” while helping to spur innovation.\n\nThe decision will place both operations under the oversight of Rick Osterloh, a Google executive who previously oversaw the company's hardware group. Not long ago, Google insulated Android development from the hardware division, saying it wanted to avoid giving its phone designers an unfair advantage over the other major smartphone makers who used Android — including Samsung and Motorola, as well as Chinese companies such as Oppo and Xiaomi.\n\nThen a few years ago, Google started to position the Pixel as a flagship for demonstrating what AI could accomplish and leaned heavily into developing features that could demonstrate its potential. That meant more integration of AI hardware and software to power those features on mobile devices.\n\nIn an interview with The Verge, a tech publication, Osterloh noted that AI is the primary reason for bringing together Google's consumer hardware and software engineers. He argued that phone technology is already growing more dependent on AI, citing the development of the Pixel camera, which among other things uses the technology for features that enhance nighttime photos or automatically choose the best of several closely timed shots.\n\nCombining the teams, Osterloh added, is a way for Google to move even faster on infusing AI into its features. Designing the Pixel camera several years ago, he said in the interview, required deep knowledge of not just the complex hardware and software systems involved, but also the then-early AI models used for image processing.\n\n“That hardware-software-AI integration really showed how AI could totally transform a user experience,” Osterloh said. “That was important. And it’s even more true today.”\n\n“What you’re now starting to see Google do is flex its core AI innovation engines,” said Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner. “Google wants to dominate the AI, the commanding heights of the emerging AI economy, both on the consumer side as well as on the enterprise side, essentially by infusing AI everywhere and by connecting it.”\n\nMeanwhile, the chief of Google's software division, Hiroshi Lockheimer, is left without a title and, according to Pichai's letter, will be starting some other unnamed projects. Lockheimer did join Osterloh for the Verge interview, though, and the two men insisted the changes weren't the result of a power struggle.\n\nGoogle is also reorganizing its AI research and responsibility groups, although those changes mostly won’t directly affect consumer products — at least not for now.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks are set to fall in early trading after US shares and Treasuries extended this month’s selloff after solid economic readings and hawkish Fedspeak reinforced speculation that interest rates will remain higher for longer.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Elon Wants His Money Back Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding Singapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to Qatar Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\n\nEquity futures in Australia, Japan, and Hong Kong all declined, while contracts in South Korea and mainland China rose. US equity futures were steady after the S&P 500 dropped for a fifth day Thursday, with its most influential group — technology — leading declines.\n\nTreasuries fell across the US curve — with two-year yields once again near the 5% mark. The dollar resumed its advance while the yen swung between a gains and losses as officials raised concern over excessive moves in currencies. An initial quarter-point Federal Reserve rate cut remained priced in for November.\n\nGlobal markets have been ravaged this week as traders slashed bets on Fed easing this year following a series of hawkish comments from officials and data that indicates a robust US economy. The MSCI All Country World Index has dropped 2.1%, on track for its biggest weekly decline since October. The VIX — a gauge of market volatility — climbed to its highest this week in more than five months.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of hiking, New York Fed President John Williams said while it’s “not” his baseline expectation, it’s possible — if warranted. His Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said he doesn’t think it will be appropriate to ease until toward the end of 2024. The Fed may “potentially” hold rates steady all year, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari told Fox News Channel.\n\nIn economic data, US jobless claims remained subdued, consistent with a healthy job market. Separately, the Philadelphia Fed factory index topped estimates. While existing-home sales fell, the pace was roughly in line with the median forecast of economists.\n\nThe market’s biggest worry right now is inflation, which is re-accelerating and throwing cold water on the idea of any rate cuts in 2024, let alone one or two, according to Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.\n\n“We are firmly in the camp of no rate cuts in 2024,” he said. “We believe investors should prepare for a higher-for-longer regime when it comes to both inflation and interest rates and that investment portfolios should be positioned for these dynamics for the foreseeable future.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders in Asia will be closely watching Japanese inflation data early Friday for signs the Bank of Japan may tighten policy further this year. An increasing number of economists expects the BOJ to raise interest rates again in October after it stands pat next week, with most of them flagging an earlier move in July as a risk scenario, according to a Bloomberg survey\n\nElsewhere, oil remained broadly steady while gold advanced amid growing political risks and demand from central banks and Chinese consumers.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "‘These mass, illegal firings will not stop us’— Pro-Palestine coalition of tech workers slams Google CEO after firing of 28 workers",
        "content": "“Don’t be evil,” was Google's motto for many years. That all shifted to “do the right thing,” when the tech company became a subsidiary of Alphabet in 2015. Whatever slogan you choose, it seems like a number of Google employees feel their company is breaking its own code of ethics by working with Israel’s government.\n\nThis week, Google fired 28 employees, nine of which were arrested for participating in a sit-in protest of the company’s cloud contract with Israel. Google and Amazon both signed a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government back in 2021, with the goal of “Project Nimbus” being to supply Israel’s government and military with cloud-computing services.\n\nNot all who were fired were directly involved with the sit-in, according to the group that organized the protests, No Tech for Apartheid. But the Nimbus contract has become increasingly controversial even as the number of Palestinians killed by Israel strikes surpasses 30,000. Recently, a UN expert denounced Israel’s military action in Gaza, calling it amounting to genocide.\n\n“Sundar Pichai and Thomas Kurian are genocide profiteers,” No Tech for Apartheid wrote in a press release. “We cannot comprehend how these men are able to sleep at night while their tech has enabled 100,000 Palestinians killed, reported missing, or wounded in the last six months of Israel’s genocide — and counting.”\n\nDespite Google firing a number of its workers from the No Tech for Apartheid campaign, the group isn't giving up. “The truth is clear: Google is terrified of us,” it said in the press release, adding that the company's actions are contradictory to Google’s supposed “open culture.”\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid  says that in three years of protesting, it has “yet to hear from a single executive about our concerns.\"\n\n“These mass, illegal firings will not stop us. On the contrary, they only serve as further fuel for the growth of this movement,” they say. “Make no mistake, we will continue organizing until the company drops Project Nimbus and stops powering this genocide.”\n\nWhen it comes to the project itself, Google claims in a statement that the work at Project Nimbus “is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” But pro-Palestine Google employees point to reporting from Time Magazine, which reveals details from the contract that indicate Google provided cloud services to Israel’s Ministry of Defense.\n\nA Google spokesperson responded to Fortune’s inquiry by asserting that “these protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don’t work at Google.” According to the company, a “small number of employees” had caused a disruption and violated company policies by “physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities.” Google says that law enforcement was called after employees didn’t leave after “multiple requests,” and investigations into 28 employees has resulted in their termination, adding Google will continue to “take action as needed.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid, though, pushes back against Google’s claims, including how Google insists most of the dissenting workers were not employed by Google, or that protesters “defaced property” and impeded other employees, as an excuse to justify its actions. The “firings were clearly retaliatory,” the group says.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid also says the persecution has been leveled more at “our Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim colleagues” than anyone else.\n\n“Workers have the right to know how their labor is being used, and to have a say in ensuring the technology they build is not used for harm,” the protesters said in a separate press release. “Google is depriving us of these basic rights, which is what led us to sit-in at offices across the country yesterday.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Meta releases early versions of its Llama 3 AI model",
        "content": "(Adds examples of use, comparison of performance quality, analyst comment, share price, paragraphs 2, 4, 10, 16-17 and 19)\n\nBy Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms on Thursday released early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3, and an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts, as it races to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI.\n\nThe models will be integrated into its virtual assistant Meta AI, which the company is pitching as the most sophisticated of its free-to-use peers, citing performance comparisons on subjects like reasoning, coding and creative writing against offerings from rivals including Alphabet's Google and French startup Mistral AI.\n\nThe updated Meta AI assistant will be given more prominent billing within Meta's Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps as well as a new standalone website that positions it to compete more directly with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's breakout hit, ChatGPT.\n\nA landing page greeting visitors on that site prompts them to try having the assistant create a vacation packing list, play 1990s music trivia with them, provide homework help and paint pictures of the New York City skyline.\n\nMeta has been scrambling to push generative AI products out to its billions of users to challenge OpenAI's leading position on the technology, involving a pricey overhaul of computing infrastructure and the consolidation of previously distinct research and product teams.\n\nThe social media giant has been openly releasing its Llama models for use by developers building AI apps as part of its catch-up effort, as a powerful free option could stymie rivals' plans to earn revenue off their proprietary technology. The strategy has elicited safety concerns from critics wary of what unscrupulous actors may use the model to build.\n\nMeta equipped Llama 3 with new computer coding capabilities and fed it images as well as text in training this time, though for now the model will output only text, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview.\n\nMore advanced reasoning, like the ability to craft longer multi-step plans, will follow in subsequent versions, he added. Versions planned for release in the coming months will also be capable of \"multimodality,\" meaning they can generate both text and images, Meta said in blog posts.\n\n\"The goal eventually is to help take things off your plate, just help make your life easier, whether it's interacting with businesses, whether it's writing something, whether it's planning a trip,\" Cox said.\n\nStory continues\n\nCox said the inclusion of images in the training of Llama 3 would enhance an update rolling out this year to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, a product made with glasses maker Essilor Luxoticca, enabling Meta AI to identify objects seen by the wearer and answer questions about them.\n\nMeta shares were up 1.8% late on Thursday.\n\nMeta also announced a partnership with Google to include its real-time search results in the assistant's responses, supplementing an existing arrangement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant is expanding to more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meta is \"still working on the right way to do this in Europe,\" Cox said, where privacy rules are more stringent and the forthcoming AI Act is poised to impose requirements like disclosure of models' training data.\n\nGenerative AI models' voracious need for data has emerged as a major source of tension in the technology's development.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded at the competition with OpenAI in a video accompanying the announcement, in which he called Meta AI \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nZuckerberg said the two smaller versions of Llama 3 rolling out now, with 8 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters, scored favorably against other free models on performance benchmarks commonly used to assess model quality. The biggest version of Llama 3 is still being trained, with 400 billion parameters, he said.\n\nThose results were \"undoubtedly impressive,\" but also indicative of a growing performance gap between free and proprietary models, said Nathan Benaich, founder of AI-focused venture firm Air Street Capital.\n\nDevelopers have complained that the previous Llama 2 version of the model failed to understand basic context, confusing queries on how to \"kill\" a computer program with requests for instructions on committing murder. Rival Google has run into similar problems and recently paused use of its Gemini AI image generation tool after it drew criticism for churning out inaccurate depictions of historical figures.\n\nMeta said it cut down on those problems in Llama 3 by using \"high quality data\" to get the model to recognize nuance. It did not elaborate on the datasets used, although it said it fed seven times more data into Llama 3 than it used for Llama 2.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced changes to Google’s workplace teams structure, saying the moves will help the company develop artificial intelligence products and services faster and more efficiently.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Elon Wants His Money Back Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding Singapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to Qatar Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\n\nIn a note to employees, also published Thursday in a blog post, Pichai said the models, research and responsible AI teams would be consolidated under the company’s flagship artificial intelligence division, Google DeepMind.\n\nTo accelerate work on Google’s AI models — Gemini and Gemma — employees working on the technology across Google Research and Google DeepMind will unite as one team, which will also consolidate the expensive computing power needed to train and build the systems under one arm of the company. Responsible AI teams across the business will also move under Google DeepMind.\n\nA new unified Platform and Devices team, meanwhile, will bring together efforts across hardware, software and AI teams at Google — including those working on products such as Android, Chrome, search and photos, Pichai said. The group will also include employees working on computational photography and on-device AI features like Google’s recently launched “circle to search” AI tool it announced in partnership with Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nThe changes, Pichai wrote, “will help us work with greater focus and clarity toward our mission.”\n\nWhile Google has intensified its work on generative AI to catch up to the allied effort of Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI, which many perceive as being more advanced, the company also has been shifting priorities and lowering costs. For the past few months, that has resulted in a series of cascading job reductions, creating a grim new reality of insecurity for employees. In January, the company cut hundreds of people working on its digital assistant, hardware and engineering teams.\n\nAt the same time, Google framed the reorganization as necessary to more sharply focus on launching AI tools and services. Earlier this year, the company rolled out a new version of its powerful AI model, Gemini 1.5 Pro, which it said could handle a larger amount text, video and even audio outputs compared with the competition. It also rebranded its chatbot as Gemini and released a more open large language model to help the company gain favor with the open-source community.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Google has also faced challenges, as when the company was broadly criticized over its AI image generation tool creating ahistorical images of people. Pichai also announced a central company Trust and Safety team on Thursday that would invest more in testing and evaluating of AI systems — a move that appears to be aimed at addressing the risks associated with rolling out consumer-facing AI products by centralizing accountability in one team.\n\nIn his note, Pichai also alluded to an employee protest this week against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon.com Inc. to provide the Israeli government and military with AI and cloud services. Google on Wednesday fired 28 employees involved in the protest.\n\n“We have a culture of vibrant, open discussion that enables us to create amazing products and turn great ideas into action,” Pichai wrote. “But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: This is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google said on Thursday it would consolidate teams that focus on building artificial intelligence models across its Research and DeepMind divisions in its latest push to develop its AI portfolio. Google will relocate its Responsible AI teams - which focuses on safe AI development - from Research to DeepMind so that they are closer to where AI models are built and scaled, the company said in a blog post. The move comes amid growing global concerns about AI safety and increasing calls for regulation of the technology. The DeepMind team helped develop Google's most advanced artificial intelligence model, Gemini, which was unveiled late last year and can crunch different forms of information such as video, audio and text. While the rollout of Gemini helped boost Alphabet's share price, it came under fire after inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions. Google then paused its image generation capabilities.\n\nThe search engine giant had merged its research units Google Brain and DeepMind a year back to sharpen its focus on AI development and get ahead of rivals like Microsoft, a partner of ChatGPT and Sora maker OpenAI.\n\nSeparately, Microsoft also tapped DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman as the head of its newly created consumer AI unit last month.\n\nThe consolidation at Google's AI team follows on the heels of a series of job cuts and cost reductions, even as the company ramps up its investment in AI and automation. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said last year that the company plans on releasing a series of AI models in 2024.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "As Meta debuts its Llama 3 model, today’s generative AI landscape is a different animal",
        "content": "Meta today debuted updated versions of its free Llama AI model, which has been among the most popular open-source models in the market but which has faced increasing competition from both other open-source contenders and companies offering paid closed access models. Called Llama 3, the new set of models represent Meta’s attempt to match some of the capabilities currently being offered by rivals such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in their latest models, but which so far have only been available in closed, paid proprietary services.\n\nMeta said it wants the most capable Llama 3 models to be multimodal, meaning they can take in text, images, and even video and then generate outputs in all of those different formats. Meta is also aiming to make the models multilingual, with larger “context windows,” meaning they can be fed ample amounts of data to analyze or summarize. (Larger context windows have also been shown to reduce a model’s hallucination rate, or how often it outputs inaccurate information in response to a prompt.) The Llama models boast improved reasoning and coding capabilities, too, according to Meta.\n\nAs many industry-watchers had expected, the company has initially released two smaller versions of Llama 3, which it said in a press release “are the best open-source models of their class, period” and will be available shortly on platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, and Hugging Face. But these models are not as capable as some of the most high-performing proprietary models in the market.\n\nA much larger version of Llama 3—with more than 400 billion parameters—is still being trained, with the company saying it will make a decision on whether and how to release it following safety testing in the coming months.\n\nBut Ragavan Srinivasan, Meta’s VP of product in charge of Llama, told Fortune that this larger version is “trending to be on par with some of the best-in-class proprietary models that you see out in the market today,” adding that it will have additional capabilities “baked into it.” These capabilities would match or exceed what is currently on offer from models such as Claude 3, Gemini, or GPT-4.\n\nThe Llama 3 announcement accompanied the release of a new version of Meta AI, the company’s assistant that will now be powered by Llama 3 and built into the search box at the top of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger—integrating real-time knowledge from Google and Bing into its answers.\n\n“We believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said as part of the announcement. Meta’s AI assistant received mixed reviews after its original launch in September 2023, particularly its cast of celebrity AI characters that sometimes responded inappropriately. And even as recently as yesterday, there were reports that Meta’s AI unexpectedly commented in a Facebook group for parents.\n\nStory continues\n\nA highly competitive AI model landscape\n\nMeta is launching Llama 3 into a generative AI landscape that is far different from the one that greeted its predecessor, Llama 2, when it debuted last summer. Since then, open-source AI has exploded, even as debate has swirled over the security and safety of AI models that allow users open access to source code and model weights.\n\nThe Paris-based Mistral burst onto the scene in June 2023, cofounded by former Meta researchers—and it has released a variety of well-received open-source models, while just this week it was reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation. Two months ago Google released Gemma, open models built from the same research and technology as its proprietary Gemini.\n\nMeanwhile, the capabilities of proprietary models such as those developed by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic keep advancing—but at ever greater costs, given the massive amounts of compute necessary to train them. Meta, in fact, is one of the Big Tech leaders in spending on training and running models: In January, Mark Zuckerberg indicated that Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia AI chips, saying that by the end of 2024, the company’s computing infrastructure will include 350,000 H100s. But Meta has also committed to making its models freely available as open-source products in hopes that it will control the platform on which others are building and eventually find a way to monetize that position. It’s an expensive strategy with no certain path to profits anytime soon.\n\nFinally, the war for AI talent continues to heat up, with fierce competition for top researchers and many former Big Tech engineers jumping ship to launch their own startups. As Fortune recently reported, Meta has seen its own AI brain drain of late, with several high-level departures, including its senior director of generative AI. This has significant impact on the generative AI race that Zuckerberg is running: If Meta wants to stay ahead, it needs to make sure it can hold on to the top AI talent most qualified to build these models. Conversely, building best-in-breed models helps attract the top talent, who are generally drawn to the most ambitious AI labs.\n\nAI is Meta’s top priority\n\nAI has become Meta’s top priority, replacing the company’s earlier emphasis on the metaverse, so it clearly plans to do what it takes to stand out in a crowded field. Last October, Zuckerberg said that “AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024, both in engineering and computer resources.” As part of today’s Llama announcement, he doubled down on that theme, saying, “We’re investing massively to build the leading AI.”\n\nMeta has also been a longtime champion of open-source research. It created an open-source ecosystem around the PyTorch framework and recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), which was created “to advance the state of the art of AI through open research for the benefit of all” and has been led by Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun.\n\nIt was LeCun who pushed for Llama 2 to be released with a commercial license along with the model weights. “I advocated for this internally,” he said at the AI Native conference in September 2023. “I thought it was inevitable, because large language models are going to become a basic infrastructure that everybody is going to use; it has to be open.”\n\nManohar Paluri, a Meta vice president in the AI organization, told Fortune that today’s intense open-source AI competition makes the company feel “supported and validated in our mission of accelerating innovation and doing it in the open so we can build safer and more productive models that get better and better with each iteration.” The more models that are built on top of each other, including on Llama, “the faster we can actually make progress on enabling more use cases for the end users.”\n\nDigging into Meta’s Llama 3 data\n\nMeta did not disclose specifics about what data was used to train Llama 3, other than to emphasize that it was trained on a “variety of public data”—which the company previously admitted includes public Facebook and Instagram posts—and “excluded and removed data from certain sources known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals.”\n\nMeta did say that the training dataset was seven times as large as the one used to train the previous version, Llama 2, and includes four times as much as code. Over 5% of the Llama 3 pretraining dataset consists of “high-quality non-English data that covers over 30 languages.”\n\nIn addition, Meta disclosed that previous versions of Llama were used to train Llama 3. “We found that previous generations of Llama are good at identifying high-quality data, so we used Llama 2 to build the text-quality classifiers that are used to power Llama 3. We also leveraged synthetic data to train in areas such as coding, reasoning, and long context. For example, we used synthetic data to create longer documents.”\n\nMeta’s race for AI dominance\n\nBut as Llama 3 leaps into the wild, the bottom line is that Meta will have to keep running fast—and spending big—in order to fulfill Mark Zuckerberg’s bid for AI dominance. Catching up to OpenAI while still promoting open source will be no small feat, but if any organization has the will, and the money, to make it happen, it is Meta.\n\nOf course, the larger question is why? What’s in all this for Meta? Strategically, Zuckerberg seems committed to ensuring that if AI is the next big platform shift—as many investors and analysts contend—that Meta is not beholden to another platform. Zuckerberg sees leadership in the AI race as the way Meta can remain the master of its own fate.\n\nCorrection, April 18: An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Meta had already decided to release the largest and most powerful version of Llama 3 as an open-source AI model. The story has been updated to clarify that Meta has not yet made this decision, and to provide additional context about the model’s size and future safety testing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Thursday, April 18, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA has literally emerged as the market's collective play on the outlook for artificial intelligence; the stock is up +72.7% this year vs. +7.8% for the Zacks Tech sector and +5.6% for the S&P 500 index. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for GPU’s have resulted in the company’s stocks skyrocketing. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, while it is also leaving giant imprints on the Gaming and ProViz end markets.\n\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nAlphabet shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the last six months (+12.9% vs. +14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Alphabet’s sluggish network advertisement business have been casting a cloud over its prospects. Also, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\n\nYet, expanding data centers, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities and deepening focus on the wearables category remain major tailwinds. The company’s efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry as well as autonomous driving space also gives cause for optimism.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-10.9% vs. +15.6%). Per the Zacks analyst, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure continue to ail. The company faces the upcoming patent expiration of Stelara. Though it has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, uncertainty regarding the talc litigations persists.\n\nHowever, its Innovative Medicine Unit is outdoing the markets currently, and the MedTech unit is is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products. J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.\n\nStory continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

        "title": "Google fires 28 employees involved in 'Googlers against Genocide' sit-in at New York, Sunnyvale offices",
        "content": "Google has fired dozens of employees involved in anti-Israel protests that took over the corporate offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Google Vice President of Global Security Chris Rackow announced that 28 staffers who participated in a 10-hour sit-in at the company's offices, including the personal office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, were terminated Wednesday after an internal investigation.\n\n\"They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers,\" Rackow wrote in the memo, which Google confirmed was accurate. \"Their behavior was unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened.\"\n\nThe memo was first reported by the New York Post.\n\n‘GOOGLERS AGAINST GENOCIDE’ ARRESTED AFTER 10-HOUR SIT-IN AT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS: WATCH Google workers at a sit-in Google headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nJane Chung, a spokesperson for the protest group No Tech for Apartheid, said in a press release that nine employees at offices in New York City and Sunnyvale were arrested during Tuesday's sit-in. Several Google employees were also arrested inside the tech company's Sunnyvale offices after a sit-in.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nDemonstrators were arrested after they occupied Kurian's office to read their list of demands, including that Google cut off all ties to Israel and cancel a $1.2 billion contract to provide cloud-computing and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli government.\n\nThe employees also demanded that the company stop \"the harassment, intimidation, bullying, silencing, and censorship of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim Googlers.\"\n\nGoogle has denied that its Nimbus project is assisting Israel with weapons or intelligence services.\n\n‘GOOGLERS AGAINST GENOCIDE’ LEAD SIT-INS, PROTEST COAST-TO-COAST AT AT TECH GIANT'S OFFICES Google workers protested the tech giant's contract with the Israeli military and the company's alleged complicity in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Google Cloud supports numerous governments around the world in countries where we operate, including the Israeli government, with our generally available cloud computing services,\" the company told FOX Business in a statement.\n\n\"We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services,\" a Google spokesperson said.\n\nThe company-wide memo said employees involved in the protests were placed under investigation and had their access to Google's systems cut off.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it,\" Rackow wrote. Those demonstrators who refused to leave Google's premises were arrested by law enforcement and forcibly removed, he said.\n\nGOOGLE FIRES EMPLOYEE WHO INTERRUPTED TECH CONFERENCE WITH ANTI-ISRAEL RANT; ‘NOT OKAY’\n\nRackow added that the protest violated Google's employee code of conduct and workplace harassment and standards of conduct policies.\n\n\"We are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our policies and apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in our workplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again,\" the memo reads.\n\n\"The company takes this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against disruptive behavior — up to and including termination.\"\n\nIn a statement to FOX Business, a Google spokesperson said the protests were part of a \"longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don't work at Google.\" No Tech for Apartheid protesters hang a large sign inside the Google headquarters in California on Tuesday.\n\n\"A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our locations,\" the spokesperson said. \"Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior. After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety.\"\n\nGoogle confirmed that 28 employees were fired after an internal review.\n\n\"We will continue to take action as needed,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS CHEER AFTER LEARNING IRAN LAUNCHED ATTACK ON ISRAEL In Sunnyvale, California, approximately three dozen employees gathered to protest.\n\nJane Chung, a spokeswoman for the protesters, blasted the firings in a statement.\n\n\"This evening, Google indiscriminately fired 28 workers, including those among us who did not directly participate in yesterday’s historic, bicoastal 10-hour sit-in protests,\" Google workers said in the statement.\n\n\"This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers — the ones who create real value for executives and shareholders.\"\n\n\"Sundar Pichai and Thomas Kurian are genocide profiteers,\" the statement asserted, referring to Google’s CEO and the Google Cloud CEO, respectively.\n\n\"We cannot comprehend how these men are able to sleep at night while their tech has enabled 100,000 Palestinians killed, reported missing, or wounded in the last six months of Israel’s genocide — and counting.\"\n\nAn NYPD spokesperson said about 50 people were involved in the Tuesday protest, and four were arrested for trespassing inside the Google building, according to the Post.\n\nThe Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety said the California protest \"consisted of around 80 participants.\" Five protesters were arrested for refusing to leave Google's office, the New York Post reported.\n\nFOX Business' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Google fires 28 employees involved in 'Googlers against Genocide' sit-in at New York, Sunnyvale offices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta releases early versions of its Llama 3 AI model",
        "content": "NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms on Thursday released early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3, and an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts, as it races to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI.\n\nThe models will be integrated into virtual assistant Meta AI, which the company is pitching as the most sophisticated of its free-to-use peers. The assistant will be given more prominent billing within Meta's Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps as well as a new standalone website that positions it to compete more directly with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's breakout hit ChatGPT.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta has been scrambling to push generative AI products out to its billions of users to challenge OpenAI's leading position on the technology, involving an overhaul of computing infrastructure and the consolidation of previously distinct research and product teams.\n\nThe social media giant equipped Llama 3 with new computer coding capabilities and fed it images as well as text this time, though for now the model will output only text, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview.\n\nMore advanced reasoning, like the ability to craft longer multi-step plans, will follow in subsequent versions, he added. Versions planned for release in the coming months will also be capable of \"multimodality,\" meaning they can generate both text and images, Meta said in blog posts.\n\n\"The goal eventually is to help take things off your plate, just help make your life easier, whether it's interacting with businesses, whether it's writing something, whether it's planning a trip,\" Cox said.\n\nCox said the inclusion of images in the training of Llama 3 would enhance an update rolling out this year to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, a partnership with glasses maker Essilor Luxoticca, enabling Meta AI to identify objects seen by the wearer and answer questions about them.\n\nMeta also announced a new partnership with Alphabet's Google to include real-time search results in the assistant's responses, supplementing an existing arrangement with Microsoft's Bing.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant is expanding to more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meta is \"still working on the right way to do this in Europe,\" Cox said, where privacy rules are more stringent and the forthcoming AI Act is poised to impose requirements like disclosure of models' training data.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI models' voracious need for data has emerged as a major source of tension in the technology's development.\n\nMeta has been releasing models like Llama 3 for free commercial use by developers as part of its catch-up effort, as the success of a powerful free option could stymie rivals' plans to earn revenue off their proprietary technology. The strategy has also elicited safety concerns from critics wary of what unscrupulous developers may use the model to build.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded at that competition in a video accompanying the announcement, in which he called Meta AI \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nZuckerberg said the biggest version of Llama 3 is currently being trained with 400 billion parameters and already scoring 85 MMLU, citing metrics used to convey the strength and performance quality of AI models. The two smaller versions rolling out now have 8 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters, and the latter scored around 82 MMLU, or Massive Multitask Language Understanding, he said.\n\nDevelopers have complained that the previous Llama 2 version of the model failed to understand basic context, confusing queries on how to \"kill\" a computer program with requests for instructions on committing murder. Rival Google has run into similar problems and recently paused use of its Gemini AI image generation tool after it drew criticism for churning out inaccurate depictions of historical figures.\n\nMeta said it cut down on those problems in Llama 3 by using \"high quality data\" to get the model to recognize nuance. It did not elaborate on the datasets used, although it said it fed seven times more data into Llama 3 than it used for Llama 2 and leveraged \"synthetic,\" or AI-created, data to strengthen areas like coding and reasoning.\n\nCox said there was \"not a major change in posture\" in terms of how the company sourced its training data.

The Google Cloud was a key growth driver, recording a YoY revenue rise of 26%, with the segment going from losses to becoming profitable with a positive operating income of $864 million amid a tough competitive landscape where it faces off Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\n\nBut, what investors really want to hear this time is how is Google infusing AI into its offerings. During the last earning report. CEO Sundar Pichai focused on the enduring strength of Google Search and the growing power of the Cloud and YouTube, with both of these areas benefiting from AI development in the Gemini era.\n\nAmazon crushed estimates with record holiday sales\n\nView more earnings on META\n\nWith its fourth quarter results that had record Black Friday and Cyber Monday results, Amazon reported its net salesgrew 14% YoY to $170.0 billion, operating income rose to $13.2 billion, and net income swinged from 2022’s Q4 loss to an income of $10.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for 2023 as a whole, net sales expanded 12% and a net income of  $30.4 billion marked the return of profitability. As for first quarter estimates, Amazon guided for sales growth to continue in the range between 8 and 13%, with operating income exceeding prior year’s result.\n\nAlong with the impact of automation efforts and expansion of drone delivery on efficiency and costs, investors will look at the company’s fastest-growing business segment AWS, along with advertising that should both benefit from AI advancements.\n\nAfter a robust fiscal second quarter, Microsoft will show further how its AI advances are fueling innovation and boosting productivity.\n\nWith its second quarter, Microsoft surpassed analyst estimates with both its top and bottom line. Microsoft posted revenue grew 18% to $62.02 billion with earnings per share amounting to $2.93. Operating income and net income both made a 33% jump. This robust performance was greatly owed to the success of the Intelligent Cloud business whose revenue surged 20% YoY, while Azure and related cloud services alone posted an impressive growth of 30%. As for the fiscal third quarter guidance, Microsoft forecasted revenue in the range between $60 billion and $61 billion. But, what will be under the spotlight is the way CEO Satya Nadella’s words are turning into action, as Nadella commented during the last earnings report that Microsoft went from talking to actually applying AI at a scale.\n\nBesides showing their corporate financial health, these earnings reports will also provide valuable insights about the health of the tech industry as a whole, along with a glimpse of the direction in which the world is headed as the new AI era continues to unfold.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "7 Michael Burry Stocks to Buy if You’re Looking for Deep Value",
        "content": "While you should never invest based on any one metric or person’s guidance, a possible exception can be made for Michael Burry stocks. Granted, you still need to conduct your own due diligence. Still, the reclusive hedge fund manager tends to win big with his contrarian trades.\n\nOf course, we all know Burry from his exploits featured in the book and film “The Big Short.” However, the investment genius – who also holds a medical degree from Vanderbilt – has made many other picks as well. Indeed, he was investing in meme stocks before that term even materialized. In other words, he knows how to read the market.\n\nNow, I’m not going to say that he’s 100% correct – no one has that kind of record. However, he definitely knows his stuff. Below are several Michael Burry stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nBased on the latest 13F disclosure documents, technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) represents 5.2% of the hedge fund manager’s portfolio. Now, whether it ranks as one of the Michael Burry stocks or not, GOOGL is a compelling enterprise. Primarily, its ownership of the internet through its Google search engine (along with the ecosystem) makes Alphabet a formidable investment.\n\nTo be sure, GOOGL probably won’t make you rich overnight. However, it’s a solid idea for the long haul thanks to its consistency. Last fiscal year, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in the first quarter, when it posted earnings per share of $1.17 against a target of $1.07.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are targeting EPS of $6.82, a significant bump from last year’s result of $5.80. On the top line, they’re looking at revenue of $342.8 billion, up 11.4%. In fairness, GOOGL is a bit pricey at 6.39X trailing-year revenue. Still, it carries a strong buy rating with a high-side price target of $185.\n\nCitigroup (C) The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.\n\nSource: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn intriguing idea among Michael Burry stocks, Citigroup (NYSE:C) makes up 5.4% of the hedge fund manager’s portfolio. The financial sector has operated under a skeptical cloud considering last year’s regional banking crisis. However, the series of better-than-expected jobs reports could favor the major financial institutions. More people having jobs means that rate hikes might not be coming soon, potentially improving lenders’ profitability.\n\nCitigroup in particular has benefited from its consistent performance. In the past four quarters, the company’s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 17.4%. Notably, the company’s Q1 print was impressive, producing EPS of $1.58 against a consensus view of $1.23.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are now looking at EPS of $5.77. That’s a solid improvement over last year’s print of $5.52. On the top line, revenue could hit $80.41 billion, up 11.2% from 2023’s tally of $72.32 billion. Also, the high-side sales estimate calls for $81.2 billion.\n\nLastly, it’s worth noting that Citigroup offers a forward yield of 3.72%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOperating under the infrastructure software industry, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments worldwide. It’s one of the Michael Burry stocks possibly due to underlying artificial intelligence investments. Oracle’s cloud service is incorporate generative AI to offer utility across a wide range of use cases.\n\nRight now, ORCL represents 5.6% of Burry’s portfolio. Admittedly, it’s not the most exciting idea in terms of financial performances. However, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 3.23% in the past four quarters.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS of $5.59, above last year’s result of $5.12. On the revenue front, they believe the company is capable of ringing up $53.25 billion. That’s up 6.6% from last year’s haul of $49.95 billion. Notably, for fiscal 2025, the consensus projection calls for sales of $57.7 billion.\n\nOverall, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $138.61 price target, implying almost 17% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPractically pioneering the e-commerce business model, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has blossomed into myriad other innovation spheres. Some would also call the company controversial for effectively dominating the business landscape, putting smaller companies out of business. Still, Wall Street isn’t a place to make friends. It’s also one of the Michael Burry stocks, representing 4.8% of his portfolio.\n\nWhile AMZN is no longer the exciting new tech name to speculate on, it still offers tremendous relevance. Perhaps most notably, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales has steadily increased since Q2 2022. That’s despite the consumer headwinds of inflation and elevated borrowing costs. So, that puts Amazon in the driver’s seat. Last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise shot up to 55.15%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.13 on revenue of $641.35 billion. That’s a notable improvement across the board compared to last year’s results of $2.90 EPS on sales of $574.78 billion. To no one’s shock, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean representing TOPS stock\n\nSource: VladSV / Shutterstock.com\n\nA shipping company, Star Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) engages in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide. Per the company’s public profile, its vessels transport a range of bulk commodities, including iron ores, minerals and grains, bauxite, fertilizers and steel products. Should the global economy improve, SBLK could be one of the top-performing Michael Burry stocks.\n\nRight now, SBLK stock represents 4.9% of Burry’s portfolio. Given the reclusive market expert’s penchant for thought-provoking tweets (often with a downcast tone), the acquisition of Star Bulk is a curious one. Last fiscal year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 7%. However, the performance is volatile, badly missing in Q2 while knocking it out of the park in Q1 and Q3.\n\nLooking ahead to end of fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS of $4.04. That’s a significant increase from last year’s result of $1.84. Also, the top line could expand 6.3% to $1.01 billion. And in the following year, revenue could hit $1.12 billion, implying nearly 11% up from projected 2024 sales.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese e-commerce company, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) represents one of the two massive business-to-consumer online retailers in China by transaction volume and revenue. However, there are concerns about the underlying market’s economy. As a result, JD stock suffered a decline of almost 8% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s down more than 33%.\n\nStill, I would classify JD.com as more of a classic example of Michael Burry stocks. Should China’s economy perform better than expected, JD could rise substantially. Providing some hope for this narrative is the company’s earnings performance last year. In the past four quarters, it posted an average positive earnings surprise of 20.13%. That’s impressive.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $3.16, a solid improvement over last year’s print of $3.06. Revenue may land at $160.13 billion, up 6.9% from 2023’s tally of $149.84 billion. Experts also peg JD stock a moderate buy with a $37.97 price target, implying 51% upside potential.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother Chinese e-commerce and technology juggernaut, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is essentially its home nation’s flagship enterprise. Invariably, then, it commands much attention from Wall Street. It also happens to be the top idea for Michael Burry stocks. Right now, it represents 6.1% of the investor’s portfolio.\n\nFundamentally, it’s another classic example of what Burry typically targets: underappreciated ideas with significant upside potential. However, prospective investors face notable challenges. In particular, BABA stock suffered a loss of 8% since the start of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, it has lost 28% of equity value. Whether it recovers depends of course on the trajectory of the Chinese economy.\n\nWith that in mind, the company provides some encouragement with generally solid performances. In the last fiscal year, its average positive earnings surprise came out to 8.38%. For the current year, analysts are seeking EPS of $8.64 on revenue of $130 billion. That’s a solid improvement from last year’s results of $7.64 EPS on sales of $121.63 billion.\n\nFinally, analysts rate BABA a strong buy with a $104.49 price target, implying almost 52% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Google's Strategic Job Cuts Reflect Ongoing Cost-Cutting Measures, Affecting Real Estate and Finance Departments\n\nAlphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has commenced another round of employee layoffs, underscoring a strategic move towards cost reduction amidst the tech industry’s prevailing economic uncertainties.\n\nThe company confirmed that this latest series of job cuts is selective and not widespread across the organization, allowing those affected to pursue other internal opportunities.\n\nReuters reports that this action follows a pattern of reductions within Google and the broader tech and media sectors throughout the year, stoking concerns that downsizing trends might persist as firms navigate financial instability.\n\nThe spokesperson elaborated that these measures were part of efforts initiated in the latter half of 2023 to streamline operations, eliminate redundancy, and better align resources with the company’s primary product initiatives.\n\nReports indicate that the real estate and finance departments are among the sectors within Google experiencing these job cuts.\n\nFunctions within finance, such as Google’s treasury, business services, and revenue cash operations, have been identified explicitly as areas undergoing restructuring.\n\nFurthermore, Google’s finance chief, Ruth Porat, told employees that the company’s restructuring strategy includes expanding its growth into international hubs like Bangalore, Mexico City, and Dublin.\n\nEarlier in the year, Google reduced its workforce across various departments, including engineering, hardware, and assistant teams, as part of its increased focus on developing its artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nAnalysts flagged the company’s sustained growth through its dominance in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising alongside strategic investments in cloud, hardware, and AI.\n\nAnalysts expect Alphabet’s shares to be re-evaluated as the market gains confidence in Google’s AI advancements and the potential for growth in the CTV sector.\n\nIn January 2023, Alphabet divulged plans to downsize its workforce, comprising 6% of its global employees.\n\nGOOG stock climbed over 49% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE:IXP) and The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).\n\nPrice Action: GOOG shares traded higher by 0.24% at $157.25 premarket on the last check Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google's Strategic Job Cuts Reflect Ongoing Cost-Cutting Measures, Affecting Real Estate and Finance Departments originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Google fires 28 workers in aftermath of protests over big tech deal with Israeli government",
        "content": "Google has fired 28 employees in the aftermath of protests over technology that the internet company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war, further escalating tensions surrounding a hot-button deal.\n\nThe firings confirmed by Google late Wednesday came a day after nine employees were arrested during sit-in protests at offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, after the company called police.\n\nThe dissent roiling Google centers on “Project Nimbus,” a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 that calls upon Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.\n\nThe protests are being organized primarily by a group called No Tech For Apartheid. Google says Nimbus isn't being deployed in weaponry or intelligence gathering.\n\nIn a statement, Google attributed the firing of the 28 employees to “completely unacceptable behavior” that prevented some workers from doing their jobs and created a threatening atmosphere. The Mountain View, California, company added it is still investigating what happened during the protests, implying more workers could still be fired.\n\nIn a blog post, No Tech For Apartheid accused Google of lying about what happened inside its offices during what it described as “peaceful sit-in\" that received overwhelming support from other workers who weren't participating in the protest.\n\n“This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers,” No Tech For Apartheid asserted.\n\nThe contract raising the ire of some Google workers runs within the company's cloud computing division that is overseen by a former Oracle executive, Thomas Kurian.\n\nUnder Kurian's leadership, cloud computing has emerged as one of Google's fastest-growing divisions, with revenue of $33 billion last year, a 26% increase from 2022. A wide range of private-sector companies also buy Google's cloud computing services, in addition to governments around the world.\n\nGoogle workers have periodically staged angry protests over other deals the company has been working on and have also raised ethical concerns about the way it is developing artificial intelligence.\n\nOne of the previous employee uprisings resulted in Google deciding in 2018 to end a contract with the U.S. defense department called “Project Maven” that involved helping the armed forces analyze military videos.\n\nBut Google has continued to thrive, despite the internal misgivings about the way it is making some of its money. Its revenue mostly comes through digital advertising sold through an internet empire that depends on its dominant search engine as its main pillar.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet Inc., posted a $74 billion profit last year and now employs about 182,000 workers worldwide — about 83,000 more people than in 2018 when it abandoned Project Maven.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used an ETF screener and filtered out funds with an annual expense ratio of 0.10% and under. We got 44 ETFs which were listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. Then, we manually checked the share price performance for the resultant funds and chose the top 15. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of April 15, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. It is important to note, however, that not all ETFs have been trading for 5 years. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 15 Best Low Cost ETFs\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Low Cost ETFs\n\n15.

It focuses on investing in companies with a combination of high trailing and future free cash flow yields, which also have a track record of increasing dividends. The fund seeks to mirror the performance of the Kelly US Cash Flow Dividend Leaders Index. Launched on September 13, 2023, the ETF manages assets amounting to $16.05 million as of April 12, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.00%.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is one of the best stocks to monitor.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other Q4 laggards were global reinsurer Arch Capital and shipping company FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)—holdings that pulled back following large gains. Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism. Although the demand environment remains challenging globally, particularly in the Express segment, the company is delivering solid earnings growth driven by cost savings initiatives. FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”\n\n14. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 31.15%\n\nNext on our list of the best low cost ETFs is the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR), which aims to reflect the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which includes small-cap US stocks.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.\n\n10.

        "title": "Here's Why I'm Buying Alphabet's Stock Before April 25",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently notched a new all-time high. While this may cause some to be hesitant about purchasing the stock, I think it's a great sign that investors are finally starting to realize Alphabet's potential.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying Alphabet stock right now, I'd consider picking up some shares before April 25, as there could be some huge news that day that could kick-start a massive bull run in the stock.\n\nAdvertising is a key part of Alphabet's business\n\nSo, what's so important about April 25? April 25 is the day of Alphabet's first-quarter conference call, and I think it could be a huge day for the company. At the start of 2024, Alphabet dealt with some bad press related to its artificial intelligence (AI) product rollout. All signs pointed to Alphabet being behind many of its competitors in key areas, but investors forgot that AI isn't Alphabet's main business; advertising is.\n\nIn Q4, Alphabet's advertising revenue increased by 11% to $65.5 billion. That's an acceleration of growth compared to Q3's 9% rise. With advertising making up around 76% of Alphabet's revenue in Q4, it plays a much larger role than AI.\n\nHowever, with a large part of this revenue coming from the Google search engine, many might argue that with the rise of products like ChatGPT, Google's days could be numbered. While this is a fair argument, Google's search engine market share has barely budged from its 95% or greater grasp on its market despite Bing integrating ChatGPT months ago. It's hard to break consumers' habits, and Google is still ingrained in most people's daily lives.\n\nWhen Alphabet reports on April 25, I expect another quarter of robust advertising growth, as the year-over-year comparison will be fairly easy since many businesses were worried about a recession during Q1 last year. Furthermore, with other advertising businesses, like Meta Platforms, forecasting strong Q1 growth, it bodes well for Alphabet.\n\nWhile advertising should have a strong quarter, Alphabet's AI game is also improving.\n\nAlphabet's latest AI products have been more accepted by the market\n\nAlphabet is taking on multiple competitors at once in the AI world.\n\nIts generative AI model, Gemini, may have struggled initially when it launched. However, Gemini 1.5 has multiple advantages over competitors like ChatGPT. Gemini 1.5 outperforms it in benchmark tests, such as the massive multitask language understanding test, the first model to outperform human experts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is also increasing the performance of its AI models in its cloud computing offering, Google Cloud. Although it's still purchasing many Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for its data centers, Alphabet is also rolling out its new tensor processing unit (TPU) made by Arm. While TPUs won't outright replace GPUs, they are faster and more efficient than GPUs when processing workloads specifically designed for the hardware, like training AI models.\n\nThis gives Google Cloud users key advantages over other providers, making it a no-brainer choice when deciding where to run AI workloads.\n\nWith Alphabet's primary business still holding strong and its AI business starting to pick up the pace, I'm confident Alphabet's stock can move higher following a strong Q1 earnings report. Throw in a reasonable 23 times forward earnings valuation, and the stock looks like a solid buy. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAlphabet is primed for more upside, and I think investors would be wise to start or increase their positions before Q1 earnings are released.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Google said on Thursday it had terminated 28 employees after some staff participated in protests against the company's cloud contract with the Israeli government.\n\nThe Alphabet unit said a small number of protesting employees entered and disrupted work at a few unspecified office locations.\n\n\"Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nGoogle said it had concluded individual investigations, resulting in the termination of 28 employees, and would continue to investigate and take action as needed.\n\nIn a statement on Medium, Google workers affiliated with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign called it a \"flagrant act of retaliation\" and said that some employees who did not directly participate in Tuesday's protests were also among those Google fired.\n\n\"Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor,\" the statement added.\n\nThe protesting faction says that Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract awarded to Google and Amazon.com in 2021 to supply the Israeli government with cloud services, supports the development of military tools by the Israeli government.\n\nIn its statement, Google maintained that the Nimbus contract \"is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\"\n\nProtests at Google are not new. In 2018, workers successfully pushed the company to shelve a contract with the U.S. military, Project Maven, meant to analyze aerial drone imagery with potential application in warfare.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has proven its ability to drive growth for investors' portfolios. It soared to $3 trillion in market value back in 2021, and after a slump over the past couple of years, it's once again on the rise. As investors look ahead to the possibility of lower interest rates and a stronger economy, they're returning to growth investments like crypto.\n\nBut if you prefer to stick with the stock market, don't worry -- you won't miss out on major growth opportunities. In fact, certain stocks have even more potential than any crypto right now. You'll find many of them in another hot growth area: the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI market is forecast to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and today, investors are positioning their portfolios to benefit. Let's take a closer look at three AI stocks that could beat any crypto player. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares already have soared in the triple digits over the past year, but this top AI stock still may have plenty of room to run. Here's why. Nvidia is the AI chip market leader, with 80% share, and it's likely to maintain this leadership thanks to its brand strength and constant innovation.\n\nCompanies know they can count on Nvidia, making it their go-to destination, so if Nvidia can keep ahead of rivals from a technology perspective it's likely to win. For example, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk recently said, \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI.\" This comment was in conjunction with Nvidia's announcement of its Blackwell architecture, featuring a number of innovations including the most powerful AI chip yet.\n\nThis upcoming launch, along with Nvidia's increasing spending on research and development, are reasons to be confident about the company's earnings potential. And speaking of earnings, Nvidia's dominance so far helped it report triple-digit gains in revenue and net income last year.\n\nAll of this means the stock looks like a great buy at 34 times forward earnings estimates and has plenty of fuel to advance over time.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nYou probably know Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) best thanks to its biggest revenue driver: Google Search. Advertisers pay to promote their products or services across the search platform, knowing they can easily reach their audience there. After all, Google Search consistently holds more than 90% of the global search market.\n\nThanks to AI, Google Search is likely to get better and better -- and AI tools are making the advertising experience easier for advertisers too. Alphabet recently launched its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 1.5, and is applying the technology across its business. In search, generative AI is offering users faster results and access to more information on a specific topic. This should keep users coming back, and as a result, advertisers are likely to keep spending on Google Search ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also could become an AI winner through its cloud business. Google Cloud offers clients access to AI chips and other products and services to power their AI projects. Just last year, it announced thousands of product advancements thanks to AI, and all of this helped Google Cloud win or expand deals with major companies including McDonald's and Verizon.\n\nRight now, Alphabet stock trades for 23 times forward earnings estimates, a terrific entry point for this solid long-term player.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another company that generates most of its revenue through advertising. Advertisers flock to Meta's social media platforms -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- because they know that's where they can reach us. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every day.\n\nThis has offered Meta a growing stream of revenue, which has led to profit too. Now, Meta is going all in on AI, with the plan of using this technology across all of its products and services well into the future. Meta's made AI its investment focus, with the goal of having 600,000 graphics processing units on board by the end of the year.\n\nMeta already has developed its own large language model (LLM), Llama, and is now training Llama 3. This serves as the foundation for products such as new conversational assistant Meta AI -- and thanks to Meta's open-source policy, its software could even become an industry standard.\n\nThis tech giant has huge AI ambitions, and if it even reaches only some of its goals, it could be a major AI winner -- that's why it looks like a top bargain now at 24 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats for wider distribution, no change to text)\n\nBy Shivangi Acharya and Tanvi Mehta\n\nNEW DELHI, April 18 (Reuters) - Campaigning is gathering pace in India's general elections, the world's largest with nearly a billion eligible voters, as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party races ahead of its opponents in cornering resources, from helicopters to online advertisements.\n\nVoting starts on Friday, with ballots to be counted on June 4 in the weeks-long elections, at which the BJP seeks its most decisive victory yet, riding India's best-funded campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is seen winning a third term.\n\nIn the months to the run-up, the BJP has snared the largest share of reservations for domestic private helicopters to fly its leaders to all corners of the far-flung nation, an industry official said.\n\n\"The largest party has more campaigning to do because of the share of their election touring,\" said Rajesh Bali, managing director of the Business Aircraft Operators Association.\n\n\"They are covering more areas.\"\n\nDemand for helicopters, the preferred vehicle of canvassing politicans, has risen about a third from the last elections in 2019, Bali told Reuters, with the BJP making up more than 60% of election activity, followed by the opposition Congress.\n\nThat figure excludes arrangements for Modi, who has criss-crossed India ahead of the polls, as his travel is officially managed by the government.\n\nIndia has a registered fleet of about 250 civil helicopters, official data shows, 26 owned by the government or its units.\n\nThe BJP spent about 782 million rupees ($9.4 million) on helicopters and aircraft during state campaigns, compared to 214.4 million by the Congress, or just over a quarter of its rival, in fiscal 2022/23, official audited reports showed in January.\n\nPolls predict a comfortable win for Modi, but Congress says the election is closer than how it's been projected.\n\nMore resources offer a clear advantage by helping to improve visibility in the race, said Ashok Lavasa, a former election commissioner.\n\n\"I don't know, in the real world, how much visibility impacts the voter’s mind,\" he told Reuters. \"But I am sure if that was not the case, they would not be doing this kind of expenditure.\"\n\nIn 2024, the BJP is also the top political advertiser on search giant Google, data shows.\n\nModi's party accounted for nearly a third of the total spend of 1.38 billion rupees ($16.16 million) on 119,387 political advertisements on Google this year, the Google Ads Transparency Center says, or 432 million rupees.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast, Congress spent less than a quarter, at 110 million rupees.\n\nFacebook has shown similar trends, with Modi's party doling out 81 million rupees for Facebook pages against the Congress expenditure of nearly 26 million rupees, as it is unable to match the BJP's poll war chest.\n\nThe BJP spent 8.6 billion rupees on election-related ads and publicity while the Congress spent about 767 million rupees in the last fiscal year 2022/23, audited party reports show.\n\nThe largest beneficiary of a now-scrapped controversial funding mechanism of electoral bonds, the BJP got over half the donations of 120.1 billion rupees from the time the instruments were launched until the March 2023 end of the fiscal year.\n\nAs the party's main funding channel, the bonds accounted for more than half the contributions it received over the past five years, except for fiscal 2020/21.\n\nThat year's donations were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the party's audited annual reports show.\n\nCongress, the only party to offer significant competition nationally for the BJP, has accused Modi of trying to cripple it financially ahead of the polls by briefly freezing its accounts in an income-tax case.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of his Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock",
        "content": "Bill Ackman doesn't make small bets across dozens of stocks but instead focuses on a small number of players that have what it takes to soar over time. As of the end of 2023, his $10 billion portfolio at Pershing Square Capital Management included just seven positions. That's how the billionaire founder and chief executive officer of this hedge fund has delivered long-term winnings for investors, outpacing the S&P 500 over the past five years.\n\nAckman is applying this same strategy to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), making one big bet on a potential winner. In fact, this stock is one of his newest positions, with Ackman adding the shares just last year. And it's a considerable bet, making up nearly 20% of the billionaire's entire portfolio.\n\nWhich AI stock is Ackman going all in on? A player many of us know well thanks to its Google Search platform, one that holds more than 90% of the global market. I'm talking about Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), a company with an \"unmatched business model,\" according to Ackman. Let's take a closer look at why Ackman likes this growth stock and if it's an AI stock to buy now... Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet's strength in advertising\n\nAckman first bought Alphabet, taking a position across its two classes of shares, early last year when the stock was trading for less than 18 times forward earnings estimates. The top investor appreciates Alphabet's strength in the digital advertising market and the company's capital return program -- and Ackman is optimistic cost controls and efficiency gains in certain business areas may support margin expansion.\n\nAlphabet already has a solid track record of earnings growth and its main source of revenue -- advertisements on Google Search -- have held up well even through difficult times like last year's high interest rate environment. For example, in the first quarter of last year, Google Advertising revenue stagnated, but by the fourth quarter, it climbed 10% year over year.\n\nNow, let's turn to Alphabet's presence in AI. Ackman says Alphabet could become an AI winner for several reasons, including its access to quality training data, its solid distribution advantages, and technology expertise. In Pershing Square's recent annual report, Ackman suggested the market may be overlooking a potentially game-changing development at Alphabet: the release of its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 1.5.\n\nThis AI platform can process enormous amounts of information at a time, for example, one hour of video, 11 hours of audio, and codebases with more than 30,000 lines of code. On top of that, Gemini 1.5 can analyze and summarize information, offering users answers to complex questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nGemini across Alphabet's products\n\nThis sort of development isn't just done to show Alphabet's technological prowess, though. Gemini 1.5 is being rolled out across Alphabet's products and services -- and this could lead to significant gains in earnings and a widening of margins over time.\n\nFor example, AI is improving Google's search results, transforming them from just a list of links to results including summaries, a variety of pages offering different perspectives on a subject, and more. AI also is making the AI advertising experience easier for advertisers, such as offering a conversational tool to help create campaigns.\n\nAckman considers Alphabet \"one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI,\" suggesting he's confident that this company will emerge as a winner in the market over the long haul.\n\nShould you follow Bill Ackman?\n\nSo, what does all of this mean for you as an investor? Should you follow Ackman into Alphabet? A look at valuation shows that, as Alphabet has gained over the past year, its valuation has climbed too, with its forward P/E ratio reaching about 23.\n\nBut even at this level, the company looks like a deal considering Ackman's observations. Alphabet has demonstrated its ability to keep advertisers -- its biggest revenue source -- coming back even during difficult times. The company's AI investment is producing promising results that could boost Alphabet's revenue in two ways -- AI applied to search will strengthen that business and AI tools sold to Google Cloud customers may result in revenue gains there.\n\nAnd we're still in the early days of AI so the biggest earnings opportunity may be down the road. All of this means billionaire investor Bill Ackman may be right to bet on Alphabet now, at the start of this AI story, and there's still time for you to join him in this potentially winning AI investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. Although the major stock indexes have lengthy track records of increasing in value over the long run, we've navigated two bear markets since this decade began.\n\nWhen the going gets tough on Wall Street, investors -- including members of Congress -- have often turned their attention to time-tested, industry-leading businesses that offer a rich history of outperformance. While the \"FAANG stocks\" are a perfect example of what I'm talking about, it's companies enacting stock splits that investors (and lawmakers) have gravitated to. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (including lawmakers) are flocking to stock-split stocks for a good reason\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, all without any impact to its market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic maneuver that can make a company's shares more nominally affordable to everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange, as would be seen with a reverse-stock split.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, most investors tend to hone in on companies enacting forward splits. While there are select instances where companies enacting reverse splits have gone on to be phenomenal investments (perhaps none more so than online travel booking site Booking Holdings), companies enacting forward-stock splits are typically firing on all cylinders from an operating standpoint.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, almost one dozen high-profile companies have completed or announced a forward split. Some of the most-prominent of these companies includes e-commerce behemoth Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), internet search giant Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and North American electric-vehicle (EV) kingpin Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Amazon and Alphabet enacted 20-for-1 respective stock splits, while Tesla completed a 3-for-1 forward split. AMZN Chart\n\nWhat these companies share is easily identifiable competitive advantages that have helped them outperform over long periods.\n\nAmazon accounted for nearly 38% of estimated online retail sales in the U.S. in 2023. But more importantly, it's the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading global cloud infrastructure service platform. Even though AWS accounted for \"only\" a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it generated two-thirds of the company's operating income. Alphabet's Google gobbled up an impressive 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, and hasn't gone a month without securing at least a 90% share of global internet search in nine years. It's also the parent of YouTube, the second most-visited social site on the planet. Tesla is the first automaker to have successfully built itself from the ground up to mass production in well over a half-century. It produced almost 1.85 million EVs last year and is the only pure-play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, it's not hard to see why everyday investors and lawmakers alike have flocked to stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCongress' most active stock trader is buying shares of this magnificent stock-split stock\n\nThanks to the STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers to report their trading activity of $1,000 or more within 45 days, retail investors can keep tabs on what our elected officials are buying and selling. Based on periodic transaction reports, we've learned that Congress' most active trader, House Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), has been buying shares of the most-prominent stock-split stock of 2024: retail giant Walmart(NYSE: WMT).\n\nKhanna is a busy representative from a stock trading standpoint. In 2023, he made 4,253 trades, based on data from Capitol Trades. For context, this is over twice as many trades as the second most active stock trader in Washington, D.C., Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who completed 1,826 trades last year.\n\nAccording to filings, Khanna acquired between $50,000 and $100,000 worth of Walmart common stock on Oct. 31, 2023, another $15,000 to $50,000 in shares on Jan. 10, 2024, and between $15,000 and $50,000 in shares on Feb. 13, 2024.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy about Khanna's final purchase is it came after Walmart had announced its plans to conduct a 3-for-1 forward split.\n\nDoug McMillon, the president and CEO of Walmart, noted in his company's press release announcing the split that:\n\nSam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates. Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.\n\nWalmart completed its 3-for-1 split prior to start of trading on February 26.\n\nStock-split stock Walmart offers clear competitive advantages, but its shares are now pricey\n\nAside from generating plenty of buzz from its stock split, Walmart has historically used its size as its biggest competitive edge.\n\nAlthough size doesn't always matter in the business world, having deep pockets can come in particularly handy for retailers. Being able to buy products in large quantities helps Walmart reduce its per-unit costs and, ultimately, lowers the sales price of those items. The company's draw with consumers has long been its ability to undercut traditional grocery stores and local mom-and-pop shops on price.\n\nWalmart's stores aren't tiny, either. The company purchases groceries and products for the home that draw in all types of consumers. Its expansive product offerings drive home the idea that it can be a one-stop shopping destination for consumers.\n\nWalmart is also benefiting from its aggressive investments in technology. This includes everything from improving the online ordering process for its customers to smoothing out the kinks in its supply chain to ensure that its stores have the right merchandise. WMT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the long run, Walmart has proven it's a phenomenal business. But as things stand right now, Walmart's stock is, arguably, pricey.\n\nAlthough stock-split stocks typically command a valuation premium because of their undeniable competitive advantages, a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 may be the upper bound for a company not outpacing the rate of inflation by much in the growth department.\n\nFor example, excluding currency movements, Walmart registered sales growth of 4.9% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31, 2024). Wall Street analysts are forecasting sales growth of roughly 4% in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. All three of these figures aren't much higher than the prevailing rate of inflation in the U.S. In other words, there's not much in the way of true organic growth from Walmart, even with its e-commerce sales booming.\n\nWhile patient investors in Walmart should do just fine, active traders, like House Rep. Ro Khanna, may end up disappointed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google Fires Workers Protesting $1.2 Billion Israeli Contract",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google has fired 28 employees after they were involved in protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon.com Inc. to provide the Israeli government with AI and cloud services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Again Elon Wants His Money Back Bankers Hit With Millions in Breakup Fees for Ditching New Jobs\n\nThe protests, which were led by the No Tech for Apartheid organization, took place Tuesday across Google offices in New York City, Seattle, and Sunnyvale, California. Protesters in New York and California staged a nearly 10-hour sit-in, with others documenting the action, including through a Twitch livestream. Nine of them were arrested Tuesday evening on trespassing charges.\n\nSeveral workers involved in the protests, including those who were not directly engaged in the sit-in, received a message from the company’s Employee Relations group informing them that they had been put on leave. Google told the affected employees that it’s “keeping this matter as confidential as possible, only disclosing information on a need to know basis” in an email seen by Bloomberg. On Wednesday evening, the workers were informed they were being dismissed by the company, according to a statement from Google staff with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign.\n\n“Physically impeding other employees’ work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior,” Google said in a statement about the protesters. “After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety. We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed.”\n\nGoogle has long favored a culture of open debate, but employee activism in recent years has tested that commitment. Workers who organized a 2018 walkout over the company’s handling of sexual assault allegations said Google punished them for their activism. Four other workers alleged they were fired for organizing opposition to Google’s work with federal Customs and Border Protection and for other workplace advocacy.\n\nUS labor law gives employees the right to engage in collective action related to working conditions. Tech workers will likely argue that this should grant them the ability to band together to object to how the tools they create are used, said John Logan, a professor of labor at San Francisco State University.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Tech workers are not like other kinds of workers,” he said. “You can make an argument in this case that having some sort of say or control or ability to protest about how their work product is being used is actually a sort of key issue.”\n\nTech companies like Google have a reputation for having “more egalitarian and very cosmopolitan work cultures, but when they encountered labor activism among their own workers, they actually responded in a sort of quite draconian way,” Logan added.\n\nTwo Googlers who were involved in the protest in California told Bloomberg that a group of workers gathered on the sixth floor of Google’s Sunnyvale bureau, where Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian’s office is located, to show support for those who were staging the sit-in. It’s unclear how Google identified participants in the protest, as only some had their badges scanned by security personnel, and some of those who were fired were outside Google’s offices, according to the employees.\n\nOne worker said Google may have framed the move to initially place employees on leave as “confidential” to save face publicly, and argued that the protesters did not violate any company policies. The protesters left the building as soon as they were asked to and did not obstruct or disrupt others at the company, the person said.\n\nBeyond the protest, Google has struggled with how to manage internal debate about the Middle East conflict. After the demonstration, posts on internal Google forums featured a mix of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli sentiment, with a number of other workers saying they felt the topic was inappropriate for the workplace, a Google employee said. Moderators locked down some threads on the subject, saying prior discussions had gotten too heated, the employee added.\n\nDespite Google’s response, employees demonstrating against Project Nimbus have seen an uptick in support since the sit-in, said one of the fired workers.\n\n(Updates with Google’s response)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk Premiums Are Rising, and Insurers Say Lawsuits Are to Blame Amazon Expands Sales of Its Cashierless Tech, While Scaling Back Itself\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off.\n\n“We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.”\n\nBut generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nMeta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter.\n\nStrap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks.\n\nGenerative AI takes center stage again\n\nThe generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. Microsoft will report earnings on April 25 as investors wait to learn more about how the company is monetizing its AI strategy. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n“We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year-to-date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That’s sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nBut the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform.\n\n“You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia will relinquish its lead in the market anytime soon. It’s still miles ahead of rivals AMD and Intel in terms of market share, and it just debuted its Blackwell architecture during its GTC developer conference in March, which should put it even further ahead. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about processing units during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., on March 18. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“They still have a commanding lead and share, and their influence is huge, and they are not slowing down, to their credit,” O’Donnell said. “But the law of big numbers starts to kick in at a certain point.”\n\nThen there are the hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google. While they’ve been riding the AI hype train, many of their generative AI software offerings are still in the works, meaning it’s a bit early to get a full read on overall uptake among enterprise and consumer customers. Still, Wall Street will likely be looking for at least some revenue growth from the companies’ AI investments.\n\n“How much is AI driving [Microsoft’s] Azure? How much is AI driving Google Cloud growth? How much is it continuing to help AWS which has sort of seen its numbers slow,” said Newman.\n\nIn its last quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to its Azure revenue, up from 3 percentage points in the prior quarter. And you can bet analysts will be looking to see if the company can keep that kind of growth up in the current quarter.\n\nAmazon also pointed to AI as a growth catalyst during its last earnings call, saying revenue was \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers showed interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see if the company provides any more context around that acceleration in its upcoming earnings call. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O annual developer conference at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, Calif., on May 10, 2023. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle, like Microsoft, will also likely face questions about sales of its AI-enhanced productivity suite and how customers are responding. The company, which will host its I/O developer conference in May, has also faced controversy over its AI rollout, pulling back its Gemini AI generator after it generated historically inaccurate images.\n\nApple on deck\n\nApple’s earnings will also be a hot ticket but don’t expect the company to reveal anything about its future generative AI plans.\n\n“Apple needs to disclose something, but the company has never really been in a hurry to pacify industry investors,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think they're going to wait until WWDC in a couple of months to bring that out.”\n\nOutside of AI, investors are eagerly anticipating Apple’s iPhone revenue numbers and commentary on its lawsuits. On Monday, market intelligence firm IDC reported that global iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the current quarter. That could have a significant impact on Apple’s overall revenue.\n\nSales in China are also a problem for the company. Apple reported revenue in its third-largest market declined 13% in the prior quarter. That, coupled with falling iPhone shipments, could spell trouble for the company’s earnings.\n\nDespite those headwinds, however, there could be a bright spot. According to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple should report double-digit growth in its Services segment, which could help buoy overall sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe company’s upcoming earrings will also give investors their first glimpse into Vision Pro sales, which should offer some insight into early consumer and enterprise interest in the AR/VR headset.\n\nDigital advertising sales on the rise\n\nMeta and Google will also be on deck to show whether they can keep up the momentum in the digital advertising market. In the prior quarter, Meta’s ad sales jumped 24%, while Google’s ad sales, including YouTube ads, increased 11%.\n\nAmazon, which has built its own impressive advertising business, could also see continued ad sales growth. In the prior quarter, the company reported advertising revenue of $14.7 billion, up 27% year over year. Another performance like that could provide a nice boost to the company’s bottom line.\n\nAnalysts will also be on the lookout to see if AI is impacting advertising sales.\n\n“Theoretically, targeting should be better by using AI even with the deprecation of the cookie, but we haven't seen that yet,” Moorhead said. “To me, the evidence that I would have to see is a higher cost per click or a better CPM.”\n\nWe’ll find out all of that and more when Big Tech earnings kick off next week.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google is laying off an unspecified number of employees, a company spokesperson said on Wednesday, marking the latest cuts at the technology giant as it cracks down on costs.\n\nThe Google spokesperson said the layoffs are not company-wide and that affected employees will be able to apply for internal roles, but did not specify the number of employees impacted nor the teams involved.\n\nA small percentage of the impacted roles will move to hubs the company is investing in, including India, Chicago, Atlanta and Dublin.\n\nThe layoffs follow a slew of job cuts across Google, and the tech and media industry this year, adding to fears that layoffs may continue as companies grapple with economic uncertainty.\n\n\"Throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nEmployees across several of Google' teams in its real estate and finance departments have been affected, according to a Business Insider report on Wednesday. The finance teams affected include Google's treasury, business services, and revenue cash operations, it added.\n\nGoogle's finance chief, Ruth Porat, sent an email to staff saying the restructuring includes expanding growth to Bangalore, Mexico City, and Dublin, according to the Business Insider report.\n\nGoogle let go of hundreds of workers across multiple teams in January including its engineering, hardware and assistant teams as the company ramps up investment and builds its artificial intelligence offerings.\n\nCompany CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly told employees at the start of the year to expect more job cuts.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Stocks the Hedge Fund Gurus Are Piling Into: April 2024",
        "content": "With a lot of uncertainty in the market from geopolitics down to monetary policy, jittery investors may find comfort in hedge fund picks. Specifically, ideas that the alpha wolves of the market have put their money into may offer both confidence and upside.\n\nWhen I think about this theme, I can’t help but recall the film “Wall Street” (the original one). The antihero of the movie, Gordon Gekko, remarks that he hates losses. Instead, he prefers sure things, which eventually moves the narrative forward (I won’t give it away). And that’s why hedge fund picks are intriguing – these institutions hate losses.\n\nOf course, the risk factor is that these entities can often absorb the consequences of their mistakes. You, on the other hand, might not be able to. So, take these ideas with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for high-success-probability ideas, the below hedge fund picks may be a good place to start.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoftware and technology hardware giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have a reputation for being boring. However, boring appears to be gold in this environment. According to HedgeFollow, major institutions have acquired $40.83 billion worth of MSFT stock based on 13F filings in the fourth quarter of last year. The biggest player is Vanguard Group, which acquired $5.43 billion worth of shares.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why the big dogs appreciate Microsoft – it’s consistent. In the last fiscal year, the company’s positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%. Its best performance in 2023 was in the third quarter, posting earnings per share of $2.73. This print beat out the estimate of earnings of $2.42 per share.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $11.64. That’s well above last year’s result of $9.81 EPS. Further, revenue may clock in at $244.22 billion, 15.2% above last year’s tally of $211.91 billion. With its investments in artificial intelligence, Microsoft could easily reach these targets. It’s one of the hedge fund picks to consider.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be a predictable idea among hedge fund picks, it’s also a compelling one. Fundamentally, e-commerce transactions as a share of total retail sales continue to rise since Q2 2022. That’s encouraging for AMZN stock amid all the inflation concerns. Not surprisingly, then, the major institutions have picked up on this development, buying up $24.1 billion worth of AMZN shares in Q4.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft above, investors appreciate Amazon for its consistency. What makes the company stand out, though, is the high baseline. It’s not just that Amazon beat its bottom-line targets last year. Rather, the average positive earnings surprise landed at 55.15%. That’s extremely impressive, even for a hot tech player.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS of $4.13. That’s well above last year’s tally of $2.90. Further, they’re looking for revenue to hit $641.35 billion or 11.6% up from 2023’s result of $574.78 billion. Combined with a unanimous strong buy rating (among 41 expert voices), AMZN is one of the hedge fund picks to add to your portfolio.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it might not get the spotlight like some other tech players, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is vital to the overall ecosystem. As a designer, developer and supplier of various semiconductor devices, it plays an indispensable role in the innovation industry. Therefore, it’s not surprising that it’s one of the favorites among hedge fund picks. In the final quarter of 2023, major entities bought just over $16 billion worth of AVGO stock.\n\nAs with the other ideas on this list, Broadcom benefits from consistency. In fiscal 2023, the company beat all its bottom-line targets. Its average positive earnings surprise came out to a decent 2.8%. Its best performance last year came in Q4, when it delivered EPS of $10.99. In contrast, experts were anticipating EPS of $10.29.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts believe Broadcom will post earnings of $46.91 per share. That’s a significant boost from last year’s result of $42.25 EPS. Not only that, the average revenue target stands at $50.35 billion, up 40.6% from last year’s haul of $35.82 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAs an internet technology giant among other specialties, it’s no surprise that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks highly among hedge fund picks. You really can’t do much these days without Alphabet’s myriad services. For example, even if you don’t use the company’s Gmail system, you’re more than likely using Google to conduct searches. With that, hedge funds have put in $14.81 billion in GOOGL stock in Q4 last year.\n\nThis figure should only rise in the years ahead. As a well-established business, Alphabet probably isn’t going to make prospective investors rich. However, it should be a stable anchor during rough waters. Last year, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 6.7%. Its best performance was in Q1, producing a positive surprise of 9.3%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are hoping for the tech firm to post EPS of $6.82. That’s a big boost from $5.80, though it seems reasonable given the historical performance. Also, revenue could soar to $342.35 billion, up 11.4% from last year. Combined with a strong buy consensus view, GOOGL is one of the top hedge fund picks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting life as a social media network called Facebook – you may have heard of it – Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has branched out into other avenues. Right now, it’s focused on the metaverse, which represents the next wave of connectivity. While many experts have questions about this directive, Meta’s sales of related hardware – such virtual reality headsets – offer upside potential.\n\nAs such, the big dogs have invested $14.08 billion into META stock in the final quarter of 2023. With the company announcing a dividend, it could attract more institutional players. Financially, the benefit of owning META comes down to robust performances. Last year, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 10%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $20.03. That’s a huge jump from last year’s print of earnings of $14.87 per share. Also, experts believe Meta will keep on expanding, delivering sales of $158.39 billion. That’s up 17.4% from the prior year. With so many positives, META ranks as one of the top-tier hedge fund picks.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA simultaneously risky but compelling idea, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) shows that the big dogs like to speculate at times too. What makes UBER a tough idea for hedge fund picks is the question mark hanging over discretionary consumer sentiment. People are looking to save money during this juncture, especially with inflation possibly about to worsen.\n\nOn the other hand, UBER makes for an intriguing idea because of its travel implications. According to Deloitte, the phenomenon known as revenge traveling might have come to an end. Nevertheless, people are still prioritizing destinations and experiences. If that continues to hold, Uber could be an enticing speculative bet. Sure enough, institutional investors bought up $10.84 billion worth of UBER stock.\n\nNotably, the experts are excited about the ride-sharing specialist too. For the current fiscal year, they’re projecting EPS to land at $1.36. That’s noticeably above last year’s print of 87 cents. Also, revenue could clock in at $43.32 billion, up 16.2% from 2023. Even better, fiscal 2025 sales could hit $50.42 billion.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt this moment, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) may be an investment that sells itself. Yes, the geopolitical backdrop presents volatility risks for all sectors, including the crude oil space. However, the world continues to run on oil. So, if global tensions – already simmering from recent actions – spiral out of control, supply chains could be disrupted.\n\nCynically, this dynamic could be a positive for XOM in terms of sales and profits. Even if blistering costs hurt the wallet, economies just can’t stop moving altogether. And because hydrocarbons represent a critical commodity, both people and institutions will find a way to pay. With that in mind, it’s not shocking that hedge funds acquired $9.42 billion worth of XOM stock.\n\nWith the recent market dip, the institutional players could acquire even more shares. To be sure, the average consensus view of $9.27 EPS on sales of $334.88 billion imply a top-and-bottom-line decrease from last year’s results. Still, given the latest reality, the high-side estimate of $11.08 EPS on sales of $384.24 billion could be in play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Microsoft’s $13 Billion OpenAI Deal to Avoid Formal EU Probe",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is set to avoid a formal investigation by European Union merger watchdogs, calming fears that the relationship could be forced apart.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Again Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs Bankers Hit With Millions in Breakup Fees for Ditching New Jobs China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel\n\nThe European Commission has decided that the tie-up doesn’t merit a formal probe because it falls short of a takeover and that Microsoft doesn’t control the direction of OpenAI, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe EU’s antitrust arm said in January it was reviewing whether Microsoft’s involvement with OpenAI should be vetted after a mutiny at the ChatGPT creator exposed deep ties between the two firms.\n\nThe shares in Microsoft were trading down 0.3% by 12:20 p.m. in New York.\n\nWhile most deals examined under the EU’s merger regulation are eventually approved by Brussels watchdogs, officials are unafraid of wielding a veto if any competition concerns can’t be fixed within strict deadlines.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment beyond pointing to an earlier statement that its OpenAI partnership has “fostered more AI innovation and competition, while preserving independence for both companies.”\n\nA spokesperson from the commission said that to examine potential competition concerns, the watchdog “first needs to conclude that there has been a change of control on a lasting basis” between the two firms.\n\nAt the core of the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI is the massive amounts of computer power required to keep the worldwide boom in generative AI going. Running the systems behind tools such as ChatGPT and Google’s Bard has sent demand for cloud services and processing capacity soaring. OpenAI, for example, has become a major customer of Microsoft’s cloud business.\n\nIn turn, all three of the world’s biggest cloud-computing providers — Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — have become active investors in AI startups over recent years. AI outfit Anthropic has attracted a $4 billion investment from Amazon and a $2 billion investment from Google, who also forged a 2021 partnership with AI firm Cohere.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft has also been actively on the lookout for more partnerships with burgeoning AI firms, earlier this year announcing a $16 million partnership with French tech firm Mistral AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s $13 billion OpenAI investments piqued the interest of regulators — including, as well as the EU, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission — since a scandal embroiled the AI firm over the firing and subsequent rehiring of Sam Altman as chief of OpenAI late last year.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella personally helped negotiate and advocate for his return to the company — at one point offering to hire Altman himself, along with other employees at OpenAI who wanted to leave.\n\nOpenAI’s board eventually agreed to reinstate Altman and the company then named a three-person interim board and added Microsoft as a nonvoting observer.\n\nThat episode led regulators to examine the agreement. The UK watchdog said it would examine whether the balance of power between the two firms has fundamentally shifted to give one side more control or influence over the other, and the US Federal Trade Commission has made early-stage inquiries into the agreement.\n\nThe EU said it would look at Microsoft’s investments as part of a broader examination into anticompetitive risks brought by Big Tech involvement in next-generation AI technologies.\n\n(Updates throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk Premiums Are Rising, and Insurers Say Lawsuits Are to Blame Amazon Expands Sales of Its Cashierless Tech, While Scaling Back Itself\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google recently enhanced YouTube’s user interface (UI) for Android TV with an animated comment count feature in the info pill section.\r\n\r\nThe video info pill section now displays a short animation, YouTube channel name, comments count, and \"Learn more about this video\" message when users hover over it, with no effect on content viewing.\r\n\r\nThis new feature addition aims to make full-screen viewing easier and less intrusive and enhance interaction with videos on displays.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to expand YouTube’s user base among Android TV users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Focus on YouTube\n\nApart from the animated comment count feature, the company added a song search capability for YouTube Music on Android devices. YouTube Music now features a dedicated button next to voice search, allowing faster access by tapping the search icon in the top-right corner.\r\n\r\nGoogle, via YouTube TV, partnered with Peloton Interactive’s PTON streaming service platform, Peloton Entertainment.\r\n\r\nPer the terms of the partnership, Peloton All-Access members can stream their favorite television content from their Peloton Bike, Peloton Row or Peloton Tread. Further, Google launched YouTube Create, a mobile app designed to streamline video production for creators, offering AI-enabled editing, captioning, voiceover, filters and royalty-free music features.\r\n\r\nThe company also introduced AI-powered features to YouTube, including Dream Screen for seamless video backgrounds, production tools for quick editing and YouTube Create, which is a mobile app for AI-enabled video production.\r\n\r\nAlphabet will continue its Coachella streaming partnership in 2024, offering a multiview experience on the YouTube app, allowing viewers to watch up to four live stages simultaneously.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will strengthen YouTube’s subscriber base, which, in turn, will solidify Alphabet’s footing in the global video streaming space, presenting a significant growth opportunity for the company.\r\n\r\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the video streaming market is expected to reach $1.9 trillion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 19.3% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a strong YouTube subscriber base will, in turn, aid Alphabet in strengthening its Google Services segment, which has been the key growth driver of the company. Its shares have rallied 10.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 9.2%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.48 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.78 per share, which has risen by a penny in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials AMAT and Dell Technologies DELL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.78 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.76 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $66 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.25 billion and $322.34 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Got $1,000? These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Still a Bargain",
        "content": "Investors have moved heavily into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last 18 months. The release of a vastly improved version of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 forced the shareholding public to rethink the power of AI, and some stocks experienced massive increases.\n\nHowever, the market did not treat all AI stocks equally, and some struggled because of the perception that they had or were going to fall behind. Some of these market perceptions were probably overly negative, creating an opportunity in three AI stocks, even for those with only a $1,000 investment budget. Let's take a look at why these three AI stocks are now a bargain.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), has long been synonymous with AI. Since it first began using machine learning to correct spelling in 2001, it has been a leader in the AI field. It also became an \"AI-first\" company in 2016, meaning that it integrated AI into all products from that point forward.\n\nStill, the release of an improved version of ChatGPT changed perceptions. Google Search competitor Microsoft's Bing began integrating ChatGPT into its search tool in 2023, leading investors to question whether Alphabet could maintain its lead in search. Additionally, the release of its competing product, Google Gemini, received mixed reviews.\n\nNonetheless, the company recently combined its AI research arms with Google DeepMind to consolidate its efforts. Moreover, it holds around $111 billion in liquidity. Hence, if it cannot innovate in the field, it can probably buy out a company that can. These resources should help the company stay competitive in the AI field.\n\nFurthermore, despite its \"struggles,\" its stock is up by almost 50% over the last year to just under $160 per share as of the time of this writing. Also, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, it sells at a lower valuation than all of the \"Fab 4\" stocks (see chart below). With its valuation and tremendous optionality, the negative perceptions are likely a buying opportunity, not a harbinger of long-term decline for the company. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\n2. Apple\n\nAlthough investors may not think about it, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is an AI company. It invests heavily in AI-related research, and product features such as the iPhone's Siri, FaceID, and its keyboard are a few examples of AI-driven functionality.\n\nHowever, Apple has not released a \"major\" new product in several years, and its fastest-growing segment in terms of revenue is Apple Services. That strategy may have led to the perception that Apple is becoming less competitive on the technology front.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benzinga, Apple plans to release some generative AI tools in June. Additionally, even when accounting for unrealized gains and losses, it held around $173 billion in liquidity as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30). With such resources, it can likely find a way to compete in AI.\n\nAmid the pessimism, Apple stock lost value during 2024 and largely missed out on the AI-driven rally in 2023. But during that time, its P/E ratio fell to 28, making it cheaper than all of the Fab 4 stocks. If investors buy at today's price, around $175 per share at the time of this writing, they could earn significant returns as they see a clearer and more actionable generative AI strategy.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nIt is difficult to undercut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) when it comes to cheap AI stocks. Alibaba's valuation has fallen to just 13 times earnings. It resembles Amazon by being the largest e-commerce company in China and also operating a cloud-infrastructure platform.\n\nHowever, it has become cheap for several reasons. Alibaba stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR), meaning Alibaba shareholders own shares in a proxy rather than the actual company. While that is a frequently used arrangement for international stocks, it becomes risky when relations with the company's government deteriorate.\n\nUnfortunately for American investors, tenuous U.S.-China relations led directly to a delisting threat in 2022 when the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) could not access the company's internal audits. While the U.S. and China resolved this issue, it reminded people of the risks of this stock.\n\nAdditionally, the issues have led to declines in the stock so severe that Alibaba stock is down from its initial public offering (IPO) 10 years ago and is going for around $70 per share at the time of this writing. BABA Chart\n\nStill, while Alibaba is risky, the stock price may mean that investors have gone too far in pricing in the risk. This could lead to a massive surge in the stock if conditions improve, a potential gain that could entice some investors into the stock despite its risks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable AI Stocks Not Named Nvidia That You Can Buy and Hold for Years",
        "content": "Nvidia is undoubtedly the name many investors think about these days when they think of artificial intelligence (AI). And that's not wrong, as the chipmaker has been playing a big role in helping companies develop AI models and improve their overall capabilities. But there are some strong AI stocks to buy besides Nvidia that investors should consider as well.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are three stocks that all look unstoppable right now and can be excellent long-term options for AI investors. Let's find out a bit more about these three buy-and-hold AI stocks.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir is a name that has been growing in popularity with both government organizations and private businesses. The company's focus on data analytics and delivering actionable insights has always had AI connections. But more recently, Palantir made the connection more clear when it launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP. Based on customers' reactions, it's clear they are eager to put it to use.\n\nIn 2023, the company reported revenue totaling $2.2 billion, which grew 17% year over year. For the current year, Palantir anticipates its top line will total around $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, rising at a slightly higher rate of around 20%. It also expects to remain in the black, as it has in recent quarters, as a lack of profitability is no longer a big risk with the tech stock.\n\nPalantir expects its growth rate to ramp up, however, thanks in large part to the more than 500 \"boot camps\" it has held with customers to help them identify possible opportunities for AI to help their businesses. Securing those types of contracts can take time, but with a few large wins, the company's revenue potentially could come in much higher in the long run.\n\nInvestors expect more growth from the business thanks to AI, but Palantir is getting more positive attention because it is not only improving its growth rate but is profitable while doing so. All in all, this can be one of the best AI stocks to own as Palantir's mix of government and commercial revenue gives it some excellent long-term stability.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon was a top AI stock to own even before AI was a big buzzword in stocks. The company has long used AI to optimize its e-commerce operations and shorten its delivery times. While it's a big name in e-commerce, its other business segments are getting a boost from increased interest in generative AI. Amazon has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, which last month rolled out Claude 3, an AI chatbot that could rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether or not Claude 3 becomes the best chatbot isn't what matters in the end. Instead, it's Amazon's constant pursuit of investing in AI and next-generation technologies that makes it a great option for long-term investors. Chatbots are just one of several AI-related growth opportunities for Amazon, especially with its strong cloud business Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe company's deep pockets also put it in excellent shape to continue growing and investing in AI. Last year, Amazon generated free cash flow totaling $32.2 billion as it focused on efficiency and cutting down on costs.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAnother stock poised for growth because of AI is Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. It, too, has entered the chatbot wars with the launch of Bard (recently upgraded and renamed Gemini). Google's rollout, however, hasn't been without its challenges as its chatbots have faced problems with delivering correct and accurate results. But that shouldn't deter investors; just because the launch doesn't go well doesn't mean the long-term outlook is in trouble.\n\nAlphabet has a wealth of data at its disposal through search queries on YouTube and Google, which give it a big advantage in developing a chatbot that may end up being more intuitive and predictive in knowing what people may search for and ask questions about.\n\nThe company's financials are also arguably the best of all three stocks here as Alphabet generates strong margins; last year its free cash flow came in at just under $70 billion. With a wealth of data and cash, Alphabet is a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $66 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet?\n\nFor Alphabet, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.26%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alphabet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet would post earnings of $1.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of +2.50%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAlphabet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What Are Israel’s Options for Retaliating Against Iran’s Drone and Missile Strike?",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Israel is vowing to retaliate against Iran for its weekend drone and missile attack, the first strike on the Jewish state from Iranian soil and which brought into the open a years-long shadow war. As the US and Europe urge restraint, Israel is weighing its choices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBeyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel S&P 500 Futures Steady After Selloff Rattles Globe: Markets Wrap Microsoft Invests $1.5 Billion in UAE’s G42 in Pivot From China Iran’s Attack on Israel Sparks Race to Avert a Full-Blown War\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the country will respond, but hasn’t given any details about how or when. His government says a failure to act would signal weakness and encourage further attacks by its arch-enemy.\n\nHere are some options:\n\nA strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities\n\nThis would be among the riskiest and most aggressive of the choices, and could force Iran to lash out at Israel again, potentially triggering a regional war the US, Europe and Arab states are so keen to avoid.\n\nIsrael, which bombed an Iraqi reactor in 1981 and a Syrian atomic site in 2007, has long considered Iran’s nuclear program a threat to its existence. Most of Tehran’s nuclear facilities — which Iran says are for peaceful purposes but Israel says are for building bombs — are hidden deep underground, making them hard to reach. In the view of many strategists, Israel would require US help.\n\nMark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a US research group with a hawkish view on Iran, disagrees and says Israel can do it alone. “They’ve been striking targets inside Iran for years,” he said.\n\nAnother target could be Iran’s Bonab Atomic Research Center, the closest site to Israel and 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Azerbaijan, an Israeli ally. While it’s one of Iran’s less important nuclear facilities, hitting it would send a strong signal about Israel’s military capabilities.\n\nStrikes or cyberattacks on military infrastructure in Iran\n\nIsrael could target Iranian military facilities or other important infrastructure within the Islamic Republic, either via a direct strike or a cyberattack. That would send a message of deterrence by hitting Iranian soil while minimizing casualties, according to Sima Shine, who formerly headed the Mossad intelligence agency’s research division.\n\nIsrael has for years been blamed for cyberattacks on both civilian and military sites in Iran — as well as assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists and other intelligence operations — but has never claimed responsibility.\n\nStory continues\n\nAny missile or drone strike on Iranian soil, no matter the target, would be major for Israel. But it wouldn’t necessarily be the first attack in Iran by Israel. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israeli forces destroyed a drone base in Iran in 2022 under his orders.\n\nHitting Iranian proxies in the Middle East\n\nIsrael could also choose to strike some of Iran’s proxy militias such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen. There are also groups in Iraq and Syria. These are funded by Tehran and target Israel on its behalf.\n\nIsrael has exchanged daily fire with Hezbollah since the war against Hamas began in Gaza in October. And it’s fended off missiles and drones from the Houthis, who have also attacked Israeli-linked ships around the Red Sea. Still, the fighting has been kept below the threshold of all-out war.\n\nIn addition, Iran has its own military personnel embedded with those groups, many of them belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel could choose to target them specifically, as Iran said it did on April 1 when two IRGC generals were killed by a strike on Tehran’s embassy compound in Damascus. Iran said its attack on Israel over the weekend was a legitimate response to that incident.\n\nFocus on Gaza\n\nSome urge Israel to focus on its six-month-old war in Gaza and destroying Hamas, including in the city of Rafah where the Israeli government says around 8,000 of the group’s fighters are lodged.\n\nDefeating Hamas, which receives training and funding from Iran, would mark a victory for Israel against Iran, said Yossi Kuperwasser, a former research head of military intelligence. “This entire war, from day one, is a war against Iran,” he said. “We have to finish the job in Gaza in order to cause much damage to the Iranian axis.”\n\n--With assistance from Nick Wadhams and Jonathan Tirone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Now Before the Robotaxi Revolution",
        "content": "When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder and CEO Elon Musk announced a date of August 8 for its robotaxi event, the stock managed to nudge higher amid its multi-year downturn. Though shares have since reversed lower again, everybody will tune in when Musk hits the stage this summer. The company’s potential innovations may just be able to help Tesla regain its magnificence.\n\nUndoubtedly, the nascent robotaxi market has experienced setbacks over the past year. With General Motors (NYSE:GM) pulling back on its Cruise robotaxi service after an incident, it seems that overly ambitious investors may have underestimated the difficulty of putting the finishing touches on full self-driving. Though Cruise has since restarted in the state of Arizona, only time will tell if robotaxis are finally ready for prime time.\n\nIn any case, the following robotaxi plays seem pretty cheap given the relatively muted expectations for robotaxis and self-driving vehicles as a whole.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany people doubted Musk’s ability to steer the electric vehicle (EV) juggernaut into profitable growth. And though Tesla’s margins are poised to take a hit as auto headwinds persist over the near term, the robotaxi opportunity may make TSLA prove seriously undervalued. But it must deliver on August 8.\n\nAs it stands, it doesn’t seem like most investors are willing to bet on the big day to turn Tesla’s tides around.\n\nIndeed, betting against Musk’s Tesla may have paid off in the past two years. But a long-term short may be dangerously risky as Tesla looks to show just where it stands in the robotaxi race. In any case, I expect TSLA stock to be extremely choppy as we head closer to August.\n\nThe robotaxi revolution, as Musk sees it, may very well be underway and it may not include LIDAR. Even if it’s not, I continue to view Tesla as a top robotaxi contender that will be ready to make the splash, whether it be this year or several years from now.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An Apollo self-driving car from Baidu drives around California.. BIDU stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese tech giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) could give Tesla and other autonomous vehicle top dogs a good run for their money. With AI expertise and a permit to operate its robotaxi services in Wuhan and Chongqing, Baidu may gain an upper hand over American counterparts.\n\nEven still, Baidu has a way to go as it seeks permits to become fully autonomous in major Chinese localities. Additionally, it’s tough to tell how Chinese regulators will go about giving robotaxi firms the green light. Will it be easier or tougher as tech innovators look to safely go about handling those difficult-to-predict corner cases?\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, Baidu is an intriguing play for investors with the courage to bet on a Chinese internet titan. At writing, the stock trades at 13.4 times trailing price-to-earnings after having lost more than 65% of its value since its short-lived 2021 peak.\n\nUber (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NASDAQ:UBER) has been incredibly hot, melting up by nearly 140% over the past year. With improving fundamentals and sustained growth, derailment of this transportation titan is unlikely. Though shares have gotten pricier amid its recent ascent, I do view the firm as a potential beneficiary from the rise of robotaxi services, regardless of which company ends up first.\n\nSure, Uber may have given up on its self-driving unit in the back half of 2020. However, that doesn’t mean the company can’t ride on another firm’s coattails by introducing autonomous vehicles aboard its ride-hailing platform.\n\nIn any case, I believe Uber already has a robotaxi dance partner in mind. That would be Waymo of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). Though the firm may have taken a back seat on self-driving innovation, it still has plenty to offer. Most notably, it has impressive algorithms and trove of user data.\n\nShould robotaxis hit the road in droves, I wouldn’t count UBER stock out of the game. In fact, I’d argue it stands to gain further from the advancement of self-driving technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "Pershing Picks: 3 Top Bill Ackman Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "Investors typically pay close attention to shares held by renowned hedge fund managers, especially when volatility on the Street increases. Therefore today, we discuss three Bill Ackman stocks. By following the strategies of seasoned investors like Ackman, we can gain valuable insights and potentially uncover hidden gems. Known for his concentrated portfolio and long-term approach, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has consistently delivered impressive returns. He is also at the helm of the UK-listed Pershing Square Holdings (OTCMKTS:PSHZF), a closed-end equity fund that mostly invests in North American companies.\n\nHis investment strategy involves taking large stakes in companies and working closely with management teams to unlock value. At present, Ackman’s portfolio consists of eight holdings. Today, we delve into three top Bill Ackman stocks that deserve a place on your watchlist this April as these picks offer a blend of growth potential, stability and potential value.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the leading Bill Ackman stocks is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), offering a piece of Google’s dominance in search, cloud computing and its foray into artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet holds a commanding presence in the online advertising market through Google Search and YouTube, generating consistent revenue streams and solidifying its position as a market leader.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet kicked off the year with a strong performance, demonstrating its resilience amid volatility on Wall Street and continued growth. In its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings report, Alphabet reported impressive revenues of $86.3 billion, marking a 13% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also saw significant growth, reaching $1.64 compared to $1.05 in the same quarter the previous year.\n\nDemonstrating its commitment to shareholder value, the company distributed a substantial $61.5 billion through stock repurchases. In other words, Alphabet boasts a robust financial position with consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins and a substantial cash reserve. This financial strength allows for continued investments in future growth initiatives and provides stability during economic uncertainties.\n\nUnderstandably, such positive momentum is reflected in GOOGL’s stock price performance, with a year-to-date gain of 13%. While the shares are currently trading near all-time highs, the valuation remains attractive compared to many other tech names at 26 times forward earnings. Analysts also remain bullish, with a 12-month median price forecast of $166.68. This potential upside of 7% makes GOOGL stock a compelling addition to any growth-oriented portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (CP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRenowned as one of Bill Ackman stocks, Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) stands as a leader in the North American rail industry with a vast transcontinental network. The company plays a crucial role in transporting essential goods, including bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic.\n\nCanadian Pacific’s most recent financial results announced in late January showcased its robust performance and competitive advantage. Revenues reached an impressive $3.8 billion, a significant increase from $2.5 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. While adjusted combined diluted EPS was slightly lower year-over-year at $1.18 compared to $1.36, management remains optimistic about future growth.\n\nCP’s stock performance reflects this positive outlook, with a year-to-date gain of 8%. At present, shares are changing hands at 27 times forward earnings. While the 12-month median price forecast indicates a potential upside of about 2%, it’s also important to consider the broader context of CP’s expanding network, operational efficiency and strategic positioning.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe final company among our Bill Ackman stocks is Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), known for iconic brands like Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes. With a strong focus on sustainable outcomes, the company boasts over $35 billion in annual sales. In other words, the restaurant group has a loyal customer base and strong brand recognition, providing a solid foundation for long-term growth in the consumer space.\n\nRecently, management of the fast-food giant released fourth quarter and full 2023 results. Global sales went up 10% for the fourth quarter and over 12% for 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year was $3.24 versus $3.14 in 2022. Meanwhile, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders.\n\nSo far in 2024, QSR stock has declined about 9% and currently has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21x. Yet, Wall Street remains optimistic about QSR shares, giving it an upside potential of around 20%. Readers should also note that the current dividend yield stands at 3.2%\n\nRestaurant Brands’ revenue streams are diverse, encompassing retail sales from company-owned restaurants, royalties, lease income from franchised stores and supply chain operations. This diversification could help mitigate risk and provide a more stable revenue base in economically challanging times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "With the S&P 500 climbing, extending its gains in this bull market, you may wonder if it's too late to get in on the action. But I've got some good news for you: When you invest over the long term -- at least five years -- you'll find great investing opportunities during any market environment. In investing, time is on your side, offering you the chance to benefit as a company evolves and delivers on various promises from product launches to earnings growth.\n\nToday is a particularly interesting moment to invest in technology as we head for what could be the next revolution in the field: artificial intelligence (AI). Some AI stocks have soared, while others haven't yet gained momentum -- and in both of these areas, you'll find players likely to gain over the long term. That's why if you have $50,000, or even a smaller amount, that you don't need for everyday expenses and want to grow over time, it's a fantastic idea to invest it in a basket of tech stocks that may benefit from the AI boom.\n\nSo now, let's talk about the best stocks to buy right now. The following four all could become AI winners, but they also have solid businesses beyond this technology. So, when you buy them, you aren't betting the farm on just one particular area, and this offers you a fantastic combination of growth and safety. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has soared a mind-boggling 2,200% over the past three years, so you may hesitate to get in on this story now. But this actually could be just the beginning of Supermicro's growth story because we're in the early days of AI development -- and Supermicro can benefit from growth of all of the top AI chipmakers.\n\nThis is because the maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment needed for AI includes chips of these players in its systems -- and it follows their product development closely so that it can immediately make these innovations available to its customers.\n\nSupermicro said recently that it's seeing ongoing record demand for its rack scale solutions for AI including some of these best-selling chips. And new releases, such as the upcoming launch of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture could further boost orders. All of this should translate into ongoing earnings growth well into the future and push the shares higher.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading maker of central processing units, the key component of a computer. But Intel hasn't yet benefited from the excitement surrounding AI. The chipmaker fell behind in the AI space, and that's been one of the elements weighing on its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut things may be about to change for two reasons. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products, including its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator that may even challenge Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's preparing to launch its most powerful chip ever based on the Blackwell architecture as mentioned above -- so I don't expect Intel to beat this market leader. But it doesn't have to. Gaudi 3's performance and affordability could help it carve out enough market share to boost Intel's earnings and eventually share price over time.\n\nAnd Intel's second bit of good news? The company is opening up its manufacturing to others, and this could result in a whole new growth driver as the AI boom continues.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a long track record of earnings growth thanks to its leadership in the high-growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. And this is likely to continue as the company has invested to help it maintain leadership here. In e-commerce, Amazon has revamped its fulfillment network to make deliveries faster, a move that pleases customers and makes Amazon more cost efficient.\n\nAs for cloud computing, AI is set to play a big role in growth moving forward. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is heavily investing to serve the AI customer's every need -- from the basics like chips and software to a fully managed service that allows customers to tailor popular large language models for their own use.\n\nThis should help AWS keep its long-held position as the world's No. 1 cloud computing services provider -- and lift revenue over time. That's particularly good news because AWS historically has been the driver of overall profit at Amazon. And all of this means Amazon stock has plenty of room to run, even after recent gains.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is known for helping most of us on a daily basis. It's the owner of Google Search, the search engine with more than 90% share of the global search market. Alphabet's top business even has managed to enter our language, with people often answering a question with: \"let's Google it.\"\n\nAnd now, Alphabet's investment in AI is likely to further strengthen the company's leadership in the search market. Alphabet recently launched Gemini, it's most advanced AI model yet, and is incorporating AI in all products and services -- including search. The move is making search better and making the advertising process easier, and this should keep advertising revenue climbing. This is key because Alphabet makes most of its revenue through Google advertising.\n\nAlphabet also offers investors a solid track record of earnings growth, and even during the recent difficult economic times, advertising revenue held up pretty well. That makes this company one of the safest AI bets on my list, and a great place to park a portion of your $50,000 today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google backs London AI law firm in £9.5m funding round",
        "content": "google\n\nGoogle has taken a stake in a British start-up developing an “AI paralegal” as the Silicon Valley giant backs an effort to shake up the UK’s £25bn market for high street lawyers.\n\nGoogle Ventures, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has led a £9.5m funding round for Lawhive, a London legal technology start-up.\n\nThe start-up said it has been able to speed up legal work typically done by a high street solicitor using its in-house AI bot, called Lawrence, which Lawhive said has been able to pass the exams set by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.\n\nFounded in 2021, Lawhive operates a legal network pairing prospective clients with lawyers while promising to save them money. It currently works with 100 consultant lawyers in Britain and says its fees are up to 60pc cheaper than traditional firms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIts Lawrence bot is able to summarise evidence, draft letters and court applications and automate mundane work typically done by a paralegal or junior lawyer. A professional lawyer vets any final legal advice.\n\nPierre Proner, chief executive of Lawhive, said: “The consumer legal market is totally broken and hasn’t really had an update in hundreds of years.\n\n“It came out of personal experiences of really battling an airline while trying to get money back during Covid, and feeling totally cut out of the legal system. We went to some high street firms to see if they could help and it was far more expensive than was justified to pay.”\n\nHe said by using Lawrence the start-up’s lawyers were able to automate “repetitive legal work” while consumers are “not getting an AI chatbot, they are getting a real human lawyer working with them”.\n\nIt is the latest funding deal for the legal sector as venture capital investors plunge millions of pounds into AI-powered “robot lawyers” amid fears the technology could upend the work of newly qualified lawyers and paralegals.\n\nVidu Shanmugarajah, a partner at Google Ventures, said: “Lawhive not only dramatically improves legal workflows but also makes high quality legal advice more accessible and affordable to a broader audience.” Other investors in the deal include Episode 1 Ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January, RobinAI, which is building a legal assistant based on technology from Silicon Valley AI business Anthropic, raised £20m from Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek for its contract-writing bot.\n\nLuminance, a legal AI business backed by Autonomy founder Mike Lynch, last week secured more than £30m from investors including National Grid Partners. US legal AI start-up Harvey has raised tens of millions of dollars from investors including OpenAI and Kleiner Perkins.\n\nThis clutch of start-ups typically insist their tools will assist lawyers to work more effectively, rather than replace them outright. Despite a surge in interest in the technology, AI tools are known to make simple mistakes that a human might otherwise catch, and can make up facts.\n\nMr Proner said most other legal AI start-ups had focused on corporate law work, while Lawhive was aimed at consumers.\n\nLast year, a report from Goldman Sachs estimated that 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI bots. It added up to 44pc of legal roles could be at risk from AI.",

        "title": "Antitrust fervor is gripping Washington and Silicon Valley. But lawsuits have been declining.",
        "content": "US antitrust lawsuits have been falling since the pandemic despite a high-profile legal war pitting Washington against Silicon Valley.\n\nCivil antitrust cases alleging monopolistic mergers or business practices fell 42% between March 2020 and March 2023, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, dropping to 361 from 626.\n\nThe numbers have gotten smaller despite a wide-ranging push during that period by the Biden administration to limit the concentration of power in key industries, including Big Tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). It is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries.\n\nThe number of government antitrust cases filed for the 12-month period ending in March 2023 fell to 9, from 28 in 2020.\n\nThe number of private suits brought by companies alleging unfair competition in their industries fell to 352, down 42% from 2020.\n\nIt is possible that lawsuits rebounded over the last year; the government's figures for the 12-month period ending in March 2024 are not yet available.\n\nA separate analysis from legal analytics company Lex Machina shows a 19% increase for all of 2023. But even Lex Machina said that its figures show a general decline in antitrust filings over the last decade.\n\n\"Since 2015, the trend has been fairly significantly downward,\" said Ron Porter, a data expert with the company.\n\n\"It's a very real trend.\"\n\n'Not easily answered'\n\nWhy the general decline? Legal observers have a number of theories.\n\n\"It's a good question but not easily answered,\" New York University economist Lawrence White said.\n\nPerhaps a stronger enforcement climate is keeping anticompetitive behavior in check, or the government is choosing to go after bigger targets in exchange for fewer cases to save on costs and staffing.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan told Jon Stewart last week on the Daily Show that when confronting big companies her staff sometimes can be “outgunned” on lawyers by as much as 10 to 1.\n\n\"We play to our strengths,\" she said, by being \"strategic\" and \"entrepreneurial.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing a new antitrust suit against Apple in March. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nOther theories to explain the decline in antitrust cases are that companies increasingly view courts as unreceptive to their claims, or fear that the financial risk to take on an antitrust case is too high.\n\nSome antitrust experts attribute the decrease to federal court decisions in a series of cases, including one Supreme Court case in 2004 where it ruled against arguments that Bell Atlantic and other successor companies to the old AT&T engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n\nMore stringent requirements applied by other courts over the years also increased the burdens on private plaintiffs, particularly class-action plaintiffs, according to a 2020 report from attorneys at law firm Simpson Thacher.\n\nThat, according to the report, resulted in reduced frequency of filings and larger and more complex cases.\n\n\"It has to be a really meritorious case with high potential for significant reward,\" said Randy Stutz, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, an organization that advocates for more robust antitrust enforcement by the federal government.\n\nHe suspects that high bar is likely keeping some credible claims from being filed.\n\n\"The value proposition is changing,\" he added.\n\nThe drop in private cases could be a concern for federal antitrust regulators because corporate plaintiffs can provide \"deregulated\" checks and balances that can be overlooked or under-prosecuted by government regulators, University of Michigan Law School professor Daniel Crane said in a 2010 article. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. (Kevin Wurm/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFederal antitrust regulators like the FTC and the Justice Department have \"become more and more dependent on private actions that serve that deterrent function,\" Stutz said.\n\nWhite, who sits on the advisory board of the American Antitrust Institute, disagrees that the decline in lawsuits can be easily attributed to a single cause, like less enforcement power.\n\n\"I'm very sympathetic to much of what AAI does, otherwise I wouldn't be on their board,\" White said. \"But to wring your hands and decry every time there's a decline in lawsuits filed and think that means there's less enforcement, that doesn't follow.\"\n\nThere's no question, White said, that US court decisions have made it harder to bring antitrust lawsuits. But what makes it complicated to pinpoint the exact cause of a case decline, he added, is that government penalties have become steeper for antitrust violations.\n\n\"Fines are steep,\" he said. \"And people go to jail for price fixing.\"\n\n'The system is rigged'\n\nThe calculus to go forward with an antitrust case is even more challenging for businesses that rely on dominant firms in their supply and distribution chains. Those companies, Stutz said, may shy away from antagonizing a critical partner with an antitrust suit.\n\nTo bring an antitrust suit against Amazon as a private plaintiff you would have to hire a \"fancy antitrust lawyer\" and \"a fancy antitrust economist\" and thus \"the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims individually,\" economist expert Hal Singer, managing director of Econ One, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill during an antitrust hearing in February 2021.\n\n\"And so the system is rigged effectively to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least by private complainants.\"\n\nSome recognizable companies, however, have decided to take on that risk over the past year.\n\nThe latest crop of company-initiated cases includes complaints by pharmaceutical giant Regeneron (REGN) against rival Novartis (NVS); publishers Helena World Chronicle and Gannett (GCI) against Google; and a group of pharmacies challenging the actions of Cigna’s pharmacy benefit management organization Express Scripts (CI). Regeneron is among the companies that have decided to bring antitrust suits against other companies. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nCompanies have had mixed results. In two closely watched antitrust cases by popular video game developer Epic Games against Apple and Google over their respective app stores, Epic won its case against Google but mostly lost the case against Apple.\n\nOne private company successfully challenged a merger. The case, brought by door manufacturer Steves & Sons, unwound a tie-up between door and frame manufacturers Jeld-Wen (JELD) and competitor CMI.\n\nAnother set of antitrust cases upended the real estate industry. Residential home sellers across the country alleged the National Association of Realtors, its member agents, and Keller Williams and HomeServices of America illegally required sellers to pay buyers' agent commissions.\n\nA federal jury in Missouri in one case returned a $1.78 billion verdict in favor of sellers, a figure that could as much as triple, or decrease, at the presiding judge's discretion.\n\nAnother case was dismissed. US Wholesale was not able to successfully argue that rival Living Essentials unfairly offered Costco better prices, discounts, and reimbursements on sales of 5-hour Energy. But the case left the door open to allow US Wholesale to refile its claim.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech will outperform in a high interest rate environment: Wall Street pros",
        "content": "No rate cuts, no problem.\n\nInvestors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday’s trading action, despite another hot inflation report that puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt.\n\nThat was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles.\n\n“Many of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,” Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree cash flow from Magnificent 7 members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — jumped more than $100 billion in 2023.\n\nLast week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet’s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year.\n\nAnd Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis.\n\nNewEdge Wealth’s Cameron Dawson said big tech’s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a “defensive” and “safety” play, adding that pullbacks are “likely buyable in the short-term.”\n\n“Tech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,” said Lerner.\n\nIn addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetrick expects continued economic growth to “offer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.”\n\nA more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term. Analysts estimate the sector’s first-quarter profits to surge 20%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives sees first-quarter results as a “major positive catalyst.”\n\n“We expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the strong start to 2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage,” Ives wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nTo sum it up: Delayed rate cuts don't mean a downturn for tech's biggest names. Rather, those with strong fundamentals can outperform — despite valuation and rate concerns — and potentially provide stability for the broader market landscape.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Look At Buying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nIs Alphabet Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $214.59, but it is currently trading at US$158 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Alphabet’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat does the future of Alphabet look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "title": "Prediction: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Outgain Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "After skyrocketing more than 7x since the end of the third quarter of 2022, Nvidia is now close to correction territory. The high-flying stock may fall even more.\n\nInvestors could be champing at the bit to buy Nvidia on a pullback. That could prove to be a smart move over the long term. However, there are other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to consider. I predict the following three AI stocks will outgain Nvidia over the next five years.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been a big winner from the AI boom, with its shares jumping more than 40% during the last 12 months. Although this performance doesn't hold a candle to Nvidia's, Alphabet could pick up steam while Nvidia loses some momentum.\n\nValuation is a top consideration. Nvidia trades at nearly 35x sales, while Alphabet's price-to-sales multiple is below 6.5. Sure, I fully expect Nvidia will generate stronger sales growth than Alphabet over the next few years. However, Nvidia stock is priced for perfection -- and most companies don't deliver perfection for very long.\n\nAlphabet has almost become an AI underdog in the minds of some investors after public embarrassment with its generative AI models. Don't underestimate the company's AI expertise, though. Apple could implement Google Gemini in its iPhones, according to Bloomberg. If this happens, I believe it will provide a major catalyst for Alphabet stock.\n\nI also think Waymo will become a major growth driver for Alphabet over the next five years. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest projects the robotaxi market will top $10 trillion in sales by the early 2030s. I'm not that optimistic, but I still expect this market to take off, with Waymo as one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been one of the best-performing megacap stocks not named Nvidia. Shares of the social media giant have soared close to 140% over the last 12 months, and I think Meta has more room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike several other big tech companies, Meta is trying to reduce its dependence on Nvidia's GPUs by using its own AI chips. Also like several of its peers, Meta is more attractively valued than Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia faces increasing competition, Meta might benefit from less competition. A bill is making its way through the U.S. Congress that would require Bytedance to divest TikTok or face the consequences of an effective ban in the U.S.\n\nI don't think Meta requires a TikTok ban to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, though. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed last year that business messaging will be the company's \"next major pillar.\" More recently, he said that smart glasses with embedded AI assistants could be Meta's \"killer app.\" I suspect Zuckerberg is right on both counts.\n\n3. UiPath\n\nGreat AI stocks aren't limited to megacap monsters. UiPath(NYSE: PATH) hasn't delivered the level of sizzling returns Nvidia has over the last 12 months and it hasn't kept up with Alphabet and Meta, either. However, with a market cap of only $12.4 billion, UiPath could grow much larger over the next five years.\n\nI recently wrote that UiPath was my pick for the best AI stock to buy right now. Its relatively small size was a key factor in my selection process. More importantly, I view UiPath as an AI company on the rise and in its early stages of growth.\n\nUiPath is the leader in robotic process automation (RPA), and this market is expanding by leaps and bounds. Unsurprisingly, UiPath continues to deliver exceptional sales growth, with revenue soaring 31% year over year in Q4 to a record high. It also achieved profitability for the first time -- a major milestone that could set the stage for accelerated stock gains.\n\nThe rapid advances in AI are allowing the company to automate business processes that it couldn't do in the past, and UiPath is seizing this opportunity. It launched Clipboard AI last year, with TIME magazine naming it one of the best inventions of 2023. UiPath also introduced its AutoPilot AI-powered assistant in Q4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "If there is one stock that exemplifies the potential to profit from artificial intelligence (AI), it would have to be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that rendered lifelike images in video games. What makes these chips so effective is parallel processing, which takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Nvidia was able to adapt this technology to handle the rigors of AI, making it arguably the most successful company in the AI chip space.\n\nHowever, as demand for AI has accelerated, numerous technology stalwarts have been working furiously behind the scenes to come up with viable alternatives to Nvidia's industry-leading processors. This week saw a number of announcements as rivals unveiled the fruit of these efforts.\n\nLet's take a look at three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Intel\n\nEarlier this week, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its latest AI chip, dubbed Gaudi 3, in a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU dominance. The company claims that Gaudi can train AI models nearly twice as fast as Nvidia's H100 flagship data center processor and 50% faster for inference -- running AI models that have already been trained. The company also said Gaudi delivered all that performance with 40% better power efficiency than the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost,\" according to Intel.\n\nIt's important to note that Nvidia recently unveiled the successor to its H100, its Blackwell B200 AI GPU, which will begin shipping later this year. While Gaudi wasn't compared to the B200, the company said, \"We do expect it to be highly competitive\" against Nvidia's latest processor, calling Gaudi \"a strong offering.\"\n\nIntel is likely not looking to outperform Nvidia's most recent AI chips but rather offer enterprises a cheaper alternative. It's also worth noting that there's been an ongoing shortage of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips, creating a bottleneck in AI adoption. Intel's latest offering could help alleviate the backlog.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nNot to be outdone, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) announced the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v2, a custom AI chip that runs in the company's data centers. Meta announced that the latest version of its MTIA \"more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth\" of its predecessor. Early results suggest the new processor performs three times better than the first version.\n\nMeta noted that it's trying to provide \"the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity\" with its latest chip. The company isn't using these chips for AI processing; at least, not yet. Meta is using the processors to improve the speed and efficiency of its ranking and recommendation systems, used to surface relevant content on its social media sites and target advertising.\n\nMeta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, so if it is successful in its AI chip efforts, the company could reduce its dependency on Nvidia's AI processors.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAt the Google Cloud Next event this week, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) announced the availability of Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5p, the latest version of its AI-centric processor. The company said its Cloud TPU can train large language models (LLMs) -- which underpin AI systems -- three times faster than version 4.\n\nAs is generally the case, Google's TPUs won't be sold but will be available on Google Cloud later this year.\n\nHowever, in a blog post, Google noted that it's expanding its Nvidia GPU capabilities with the addition of the A3 Mega Supercomputer, which is powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs. Google Cloud customers will also have access to virtual machines (VM) featuring Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Grace Blackwell GB200 GPUs.\n\nGoogle also unveiled Axion, its first data center central processing unit (CPU), designed in conjunction with Arm Holdings. Google says Axion is 30% faster than the leading CPU, with 50% better performance and 62% greater efficiency than x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nAn important takeaway for Nvidia investors\n\nWhile Intel intends to compete directly with Nvidia for a piece of the AI chip market, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are developing their own AI chips for specific purposes, either in-house or for cloud customers. Furthermore, while Intel claims its AI-centric chips can compete head-to-head with Nvidia's flagship processors, Nvidia has already moved on and will soon be shipping the next version of its state-of-the-art AI processors.\n\nThis helps highlight Nvidia's enviable position in the industry -- its rivals are always playing catch-up. They claim to best Nvidia in terms of performance, but their bragging rights don't last, as Nvidia's next-generation chips are already on the way.\n\nIt's also important to point out that the market for generative AI is growing at a rapid clip, increasing the market for these cutting-edge processors. As a result, Nvidia will likely maintain its industry-leading position, even as rivals enter the fray.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

A Google spokesperson declined to specify how long the test would last, how many users would be affected and which news organizations would be included.\n\nThe bill, known as the California Journalism Preservation Act, “would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept,” Zaidi said. “To avoid an outcome where all parties lose and the California news industry is left worse off, we urge lawmakers to take a different approach.”\n\nZaidi also said the company would halt planned investments in news in the state “until there’s clarity on California’s regulatory environment.”\n\nGovernments around the globe have taken steps aimed at compelling tech giants to pay for news. Last year, Alphabet said it would remove links to news from Canadian publishers on Google after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government passed a law requiring digital platforms to compensate local news outlets.

        "title": "Faced with possibly paying for news, Google removes links to California news sites for some users",
        "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Google on Friday began removing California news websites from some people's search results, a test that acted as a threat should the state Legislature pass a law requiring the search giant to pay media companies for linking to their content.\n\nGoogle announced the move in a blog post on Friday, calling it a \"short-term test for a small percentage of users ... to measure the impact of the legislation on our product experience.” The company said it also would pause new investments in the California news industry, including the partnership initiative with news organizations and its product licensing program.\n\n“By helping people find news stories, we help publishers of all sizes grow their audiences at no cost to them. (This bill) would up-end that model,” Jaffer Zaidi, Google's vice president for global news partnerships, wrote in the blog post.\n\nThe California Legislature is considering a bill that would require tech giants like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to pay a certain percentage of advertising revenue to media companies for linking to their content. How much the companies would have to pay would be decided by a panel of three judges through an arbitration process.\n\nThe bill aims to stop the loss of journalism jobs, which have been disappearing rapidly as legacy media companies have struggled to profit in the digital age. More than 2,500 newspapers have closed in the U.S. since 2005, according to Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. California has lost more than 100 news organizations in the past decade, according to Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, the bill’s author.\n\n\"This is a bill about basic fairness — it’s about ensuring that platforms pay for the content they repurpose,” Wicks said. “We are committed to continuing negotiations with Google and all other stakeholders to secure a brighter future for California journalists and ensure that the lights of democracy stay on.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe state Assembly passed the bill last year with bipartisan support despite fierce opposition and lobbying efforts from big tech companies. The California Senate would have to pass it later this year for it to become law.\n\nSupporters said the legislation would help level the playing field between news publishers and large digital platforms and provide a “lifeline” to local news organizations, which rely heavily on Google's search engine to distribute its content in the digital era. While Google's search engine has become the hub of a digital advertisement empire that generates more than $200 billion annually, news publishers saw their advertising revenues nosedive significantly in the last few decades.\n\nBut opponents, including Google, Meta and some independent newsrooms, call the legislation a “link tax” that would primarily benefit out-of-state newspaper chains and hedge funds and further decimate local news organizations. Richard Gingras, Google's vice president of news, also told state lawmakers, in a hearing last December, that Google already made significant contributions to support local journalism, pointing to the tech giant's financial grants and training to nearly 1,000 local publications in 2023, among other programs.\n\nGoogle's search engine should be seen as “the largest newsstand on Earth,” Gingras said, where it helps connect users to news websites more than 24 billion times per month. Google's search engine holds an estimated 90% share of the market.\n\n“This traffic in turn helps publishers make money by showing ads or attracting new subscribers,” he said, adding that it's estimated that each click on a link from Google is worth 5 cents to 7 cents to a news website.\n\nGoogle's decision to temporarily remove links to news websites is not a new tactic for tech giants to use when pushing back on unwanted legislation. When Canada and Australia passed similar laws to promote journalism, Meta — the company that owns Facebook and Instagram — responded by blocking content from Canadian publishers on its sites in Canada. The company made similar threats to U.S. Congress and California lawmakers last year. Google had threatened to do the same in Canada. But in November, Google agreed to pay 100 million Canadian dollars ($74 million U.S. dollars) to the news industry.\n\nNews publishers would suffer and could lay off more journalists if Google completely blocks content from its search, but experts say Google also would take a financial hit without news content.\n\n“Google would be damaging itself enormously if it decided to stop using newspaper content,” Brandon Kressin, an antitrust attorney representing News Media Alliance and other news publishers, told lawmakers in a December hearing. “They would be cutting off their nose to spite their own face.”\n\nThe political wrangling over Google’s dominant search engine can throttle access to various news sources comes against the backdrop of legal trouble that could culminate in decisions that undercut the company’s internet empire.\n\nAfter presenting evidence to support its allegations that Google has been abusing its power to stifle competition and innovation during the biggest antitrust trial in a quarter century, lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department will present its closing arguments next month to a federal judge who is expected to issue a decision in the case later this year.\n\nFollowing another antitrust trial that ended in December, a federal jury concluded Google had turned its app store for smartphones running on its Android software into an illegal monopoly that limited consumer choices while enriching the company through unfairly high commissions charged for in-app purchases. A hearing on the changes that Google will have to make resulting from that verdict is also scheduled to occur next month.\n\nCalifornia has attempted to boost local journalism through various initiatives, including a $25 million multiyear, state-funded program in partnership with UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism to place 40 early-career journalists in local newsrooms annually. Lawmakers are also considering another proposal that would expand tax credits for local news organizations this year.\n\n—-\n\nAssociated Press reporter Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to the report.",

        "content": "The collective of leading technology companies, often referred to as the Magnificent Seven, has seen an increase in their dominance within the S&P 500 Index, despite not all members performing to expectations. This group, which includes some of the most influential names in the tech industry, has expanded its share of the index, now representing nearly a third of its value, surpassing several other major sectors combined.\n\nEven with varied performance among its members, this tech ensemble has reached a new peak in its contribution to the benchmark index. This rise is attributed to the remarkable gains of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared by approximately 81% due to the high demand for its AI computing chips. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also seen significant increases in their stock values, with jumps of 47% and 24%, respectively. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have surpassed the overall S&P 500's performance, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a decline of about 9%.\n\nConversely, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen its shares decrease by around 30% this year, as the electric vehicle manufacturer grapples with slowing demand and investor uncertainty regarding its recovery prospects.\n\nThese tech giants' growing influence within the S&P 500 underscores the significant impact the technology sector has on the broader market, even as individual companies within the group experience varying degrees of success.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Billionaire Leon Cooperman’s Family, Children and Investments",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at billionaire Leon Cooperman's family, children and investments. If you want to skip our detailed overview of one of the most successful billionaires in Wall Street history, then you can skip ahead to Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Family, Children, and Investments: Top 5 Stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to shrewd takes on the stock market, you're unlikely to find too many that lag behind Leon Cooperman's analysis of the stock market and the broader financial environment in the United States. Over the course of his career, the billionaire has seen it all. An octogenarian, Cooperman started his career in 1967 - an era on Wall Street that was yet to be dominated by mega cap technology stocks. Back then, Wall Street investors were facing their own historic environment. While right now folks in the hedge fund and the broader finance industry are adjusting to an era of high interest rates and the 'end of free money' as Mr. Cooperman would put it, in the late 1960s, they were rejoicing on the Federal Reserve's decision to allow a portion of stock purchases to be funded by taking out loans.\n\nNaturally, this meant that more stocks changed hands and the euphoria would continue for the next couple of years until rising costs and dwindling interest led to the government stepping in and helping brokers manage the market. In this turmoil, Cooperman was working for the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and he would continue to work for the bank until 1991, a period that would see him live through one of the most well known and devastating stock market crashes called Black Monday. A couple of years after Black Monday, Cooperman would leverage the skills he learned while managing stocks for one of the biggest investment banks in the world to try his own hand at wealth and fame by setting up a private investment partnership.\n\nWhile working at Goldman saw the famed investor make his mark on Wall Street by winning laurels, on the personal side, he had already achieved milestones. Characteristic of folks from his generation, even before Cooperman started working for Goldman to set him on a path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, he had already married his wife Toby Cooperman in 1964. Like Cooperman, Mrs. Cooperman also attended New York's Hunter College and graduated in the year of their marriage. During their time in college, the pair were quite close and would take up class positions such as president and vice president.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe start of Cooperman senior's journey at Goldman Sachs was accompanied by his six month old toddler, and today, he has two sons, Wayne Cooperman and Michael Cooperman. Both of these have followed their father into the finance industry, and Wayne Cooperman even has his own hedge fund called Cobalt Capital Management. Michael Cooperman, on the other hand, is more involved in his family's charitable endeavors and has been known to work at the Leon & Toby Cooperman Foundation. Cooperman Sr. is quite charitable too, and like several other well known hedge fund and investment professionals such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Mario Gabelli of GAMCO, he has also signed the giving pledge.\n\nWayne's trysts in the finance industry have also generated their fair share of controversy. One infamous period in Cooperman Sr.'s long and illustrious career on Wall Street was in 2010 when he had yet to shut down his investment firm. Back then, the billionaire's investment firm had held a stake in the oil and gas midstream company Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. Atlas announced a $682 million sale of an asset to the Canadian firm Enbridge, and Cooperman Sr. was accused of improperly profiting from the deal by buying more Atlas Pipeline shares with the inside knowledge that the deal would be announced soon. To make things interesting, the accusations tipped off the SEC to investigate Cooperman, who started to look into the matter purportedly after Wayne Cooperman noticed unusual derivative activity for Atlas shares right when the deal was to be announced.\n\nIn a rather interesting set of events, it appeared as if Cooperman Sr. had raised his son to detest insider trading while all the while trading stocks with inside knowledge himself! The saga lasted for six years, and despite the SEC offering him to settle in return for a five year ban, the investor stood his ground and settled for a fine without admitting to any wrongdoing.\n\nSince then, Cooperman shut down his firm in 2018 after he grew tired of the fast paced and stressful nature of professionally investing in stocks. He now invests through his family office Omega Advisors, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Mr. Cooperman's family office had a portfolio value of $2 billion by the end of last year's fourth quarter.\n\nSo, which stocks is the legendary investor who was voted the number one portfolio strategist by Institutional Investors for nine consecutive years investing in?

        "title": "GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN &amp; META Pose Threat to NVDA With In-House Chips",
        "content": "As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) race heats up primarily due to a boom in the generative AI space, the demand for cutting-edge chips that can handle AI-related massive workloads keeps rising. These chips are equipped with strong computing power that makes the training of large language models seamless.\r\n\r\nIn this backdrop, strong endeavors being made by the cloud trio — Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL — as well as the social media giant Meta Platforms META, to put their AI-specific customized chips on the table remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis underscores the idea of staying self-sufficient in the intensifying AI battle in order to accelerate the development process of AI models, which, in turn, will help them pace up advancements in the AI world.\n\nWill NVIDIA Face Challenges?\n\nNVIDIA NVDA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is riding on solid demand for its next-generation chips for AI models. Reportedly, it holds more than 90% of the AI chips market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, the strategy of building in-house chips of these tech giants in order to reduce dependency on outside chip providers does not bode well for NVIDIA. It will stiffen the chip competition for NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nAlso, NVDA will start losing market share if its major customers start making their chips. This is a major concern.\r\n\r\nNotably, the waiting time for its flagship AI chip is months long, which is causing the scarcity. Nvidia can produce only a limited number of chips at a time because it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor to assemble the chip designs.\r\n\r\nThis is the primary reason why AI behemoths are now coming up with their chips.\r\n\r\nEven if the chips being made by Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are not as strong as NVIDIA’s, they can be customized. This will not only save their costs but will also save time.\n\nYTD Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow GOOGL, META, MSFT & AMZN Fare in AI Chip Race?\n\nAlphabet’s Google recently heated the AI battle with the introduction of its central processing unit (CPU), namely Axion, to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are marked as the company’s first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nAlphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, intends to scale Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine and the YouTube Ads platform on Axion soon.\r\n\r\nGoogle will make Axion available to its cloud customers later this year. Customers will be able to use Axion in cloud services like Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow and Cloud Batch.\r\n\r\nFollowing Google’s move, Meta announced advanced infrastructure for AI to push deep into the AI chip race. It introduced the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. Notably, MTIA is the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s advancement over MTIA v1 — its first-generation AI inference accelerator, which was designed in-house with Meta’s AI workloads.\r\n\r\nNotably, MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth. It is capable of managing the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users, seamlessly. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft unveiled two customized chips, namely Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, late last year. While the Arm-based Cobalt 100 is made for general computing tasks, Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes.\r\n\r\nNotably, Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like LLM training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors. The Zacks Rank #3 company collaborated with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. It is currently being tested on Bing’s AI chatbot Copilot, the GitHub Copilot coding assistant and GPT-3.5-Turbo.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, unveiled AWS Trainium2 chips made for training and running AI models. These chips are designed to power the highest-performance compute on AWS for training foundation models quickly at a lower cost, while consuming less energy. Further, they are capable of delivering up to 4 times better performance and two times better energy efficiency than the first-generation Trainium, which was introduced in 2020.\r\n\r\nNotably, a cluster of 100,000 Trainium chips can train a 300-billion parameter AI large language model in weeks versus months. Trainium 2 chips will be available in Amazon EC2 Trn2 instances, containing 16 Trainium chips in a single instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon Is Positioned as the Foundation for Retail and Technology Infrastructure",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the first stocks I owned, and it has continued to serve me well throughout the years. I do not expect this to change anytime soon, and I believe that the company's long-term results should continue to be good, with higher margins likely from a shift to serving third parties and pioneering initiatives in artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nWhile there are some regulatory inhibitions to the fast adoption of some operations and a valuation that is not cheap, I believe the goodwill associated with Amazon shares and its strong price return will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nRecent developments\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAmazon is making a significant shift toward high-margin segments of its operations, including honing in on third-party seller services, advertising and subscription services. This is helping the company in two ways. Not only is it expanding Amazon's gross profit margins, but it is also diversifying its revenue streams away from pure e-commerce, which is now growing at a slower pace.\n\nThe company's investment in generative artificial intelligence, such as through Amazon Q and its strategic partnerships with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) for AWS Marketplace access and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) for AI-supported medicine manufacturing and development, show further strength in margin expansion opportunities to come. Amazon Q is an AI-powered assistant that aims to improve productivity in the workplace, and I believe it is integrations like this, iterated and evolving within the company, that will continue to solidify it not only as an e-commerce platform, but as a fully AI-integrated efficiency provider, both in retail goods, digital services through Amazon Web Services and partnerships and investments.\n\nAdditionally, Prime Air drone deliveries will reduce delivery times and costs for lightweight packages, which should help to drive demand and also increase margins. Incredibly, the service has the ability to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles. This not only enhances customer satisfaction, which is one of Amazon's long-standing value propositions, but also reduces road traffic and the company's carbon footprint.\n\nStory continues\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about Amazon as a business is how relentlessly innovative it is, which I believe is something that has been instilled in the company's ethos and executive management by founder Jeff Bezos, who has two core principles that I find particularly promising. The first is his very long-term-oriented focus, which positions the company well for investors like myself, who intend to hold Amazon stock for many decades. The second is his willingness to invest in new technology. When Bezos first started Amazon, it began as a cutting-edge technology tool in retail, and he has kept this perspective of being cutting-edge clearly at the forefront of his mind and trained management to be focused on this, too. Indeed, many companies want to keep up with the latest developments, but what Bezos does differently is he pioneers many of these developments and, at his core, he is an inventor, which is quite apparent in his annual shareholder letters.\n\nWith the infrastructure in place and what I would argue is a sizable moat in computing infrastructure through AWS, Amazon's brightest future is arguably in the provision of services for third parties. In many ways, it intends to act as the foundation for advanced technology and retail services for almost all providers. The scope and scale of the services it provides are what position it to continue to be attractive to a range of participants, with very little immediate competition. In my opinion, AWS faces the highest threat from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud Platform, but these are clearly not as extensive or as entrenched as AWS in so many different areas of provision. In many respects, AWS is several steps ahead of even the most advanced peers.\n\nPeer analysis\n\nFor competitive comparison and the purposes of investment opportunity cost analysis, I have placed Amazon alongside four other companies, which I believe are very compelling at the present moment of technological evolution. I have broken down the core metrics of each of these companies into the following table:\n\nAmazon Microsoft Alphabet Salesforce ServiceNow Equity-to-Asset 0.38 0.51 0.7 0.6 0.44 Net Margin 5.29% 36.27% 24.01% 11.87% 19.3% 3Y EPS Growth Rate 14.3% 19.4% 32.3% 45.3% 140.6% 3Y Futue EPS CAGR Estimate 38.53% 16.6% 14.43% 16.66% 21.11% Forward PE Ratio 43.67 31.85 22.42 31.06 56.62 IPO 1997 1986 2004 2004 2012 Market Cap $1.92T $3.16T $1.9T $292.85B $160.62 10Y Price Return 1,031.13% 968.61% 456.05% 446.84% 1,440.50%\n\n*EPS is without NRI\n\nBased on the chart, I believe it is quite clear that Amazon does not command software-like margins as the other four peers do. This is because Amazon is currently largely in the retail industry, but, as discussed above, its margin situation should improve as it becomes more focused on third-party service provisions. This is true across the range of its operations, from Amazon.com e-commerce through to AWS and Prime Video, which is acting as an aggregator for entertainment rather than simply offering in-house productions. Because Amazon now has a moat in infrastructure, I believe it will be able to crucially boost its margins and position itself as a unique retail-software hybrid that grows more focused on a monopoly in advanced software and services for professional use. Its operational expenses should be reduced as a result of this, but even where it faces expensive foundational services like warehousing and delivery, it can reduce this through AI-assisted and automated tasks, driving further growth as it replaces manual labor roles with positions in more advanced software engineering and AI deployment.\n\nI like Amazon for what it is turning into, but all of the peers in my analysis look very favorable to me. I own four of the five, with ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) a likely addition over the next year. The only element that significantly deters me from investing in ServiceNow at this time is its very high valuation, which creates some uncertainty about how the stock will perform if it fails to meet analysts' high expectations for its future results.\n\nValuation\n\nAmazon's valuation, for that matter, is also quite high, but much more bearable than ServiceNow. This is where the market has correctly priced Amazon as a unique software-retail hybrid and not as a pure retail investment.\n\nAmazon's forward price-eranings ratio of around 44 places it in the bottom 15% of companies in the retail-cyclical industry, according to GuruFocus' dataset. The retail industry median forward price-earnings ratio is around 16, but the software industry median is around 24.5. In essence, Amazon trades at a premium to both industries at scale, but this is arguably warranted when we consider the higher growth rates and profitability it commands compared to the wider retail industry and some of the software industry.\n\nI believe the market has priced a premium above what would be considered fair by analyzing the pure fundamentals, and there is undoubtedly a lot of investor sentiment, or goodwill, in the valuation of the company that has been commanded over the long term by the market. This is quite normal for the technology industry and is seen most prevalently in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has a forward price-earnings ratio of 54.64 at the time of this writing, while the stock is down nearly 60% from its all-time high.\n\nFurther, the 10-year median price-earnings ratio for Amazon is 116.26 and the current price-earnings ratio is 63.77. While the company's revenue growth and earnings growth have slowed down in recent years, the valuation has adjusted appropriately. As such, I believe the stock at this time is roughly fairly valued, with no margin of safety, but with a strong operational position that should continue to deliver good long-term growth despite any short-term volatility that may occur if expectations are not met.\n\nRegulatory inhibitions\n\nOther than the valuation, which offers no security, I believe there are risks with regulatory controls on drone delivery and automated driving that will inhibit some of Amazon's loftier plans in the near term.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration regulates drone flights, and any errors in flights and safety could result in temporary suspension of the services. Automated driving is also heavily regulated by bodies such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There is very strict oversight on the deployment of autonomous vehicles as there is skepticism about the safety of full-scale operations. While this is ungrounded in terms of the data, which shows it is much safer for advanced robots to command vehicles than humans, it is going to take some time for this to be accepted as the truth. The NHTSA has found that human error is the result of around 94% of all road accidents, and the Eno Center for Transportation has suggested that if 90% of all cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, accidents could decrease by up to 90%. Additionally, research by Waymo, one of the leaders in autonomous technology, reported that their vehicles had lower rates of contact with cyclists and pedestrians compared to national U.S. averages.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I consider Amazon to be an excellent company and now remains a great time to invest. The company is now dominant in technology and professional infrastructure for a wide range of services, and I believe it will begin to most acutely capitalize on this with the heavy integration of AI and automated tasks as it begins to focus more heavily on services for third parties.\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon is one of the best businesses in the world, founded by one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time, and having continued success in driving excellent shareholder returns seems probable to me. Even given the regulatory inhibitions that could prove challenging in the short term and a valuation with no margin of safety, the fundamental growth and goodwill of the company looks like it will cause the stock to continue to outperform the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "The generative AI boom has Big Tech companies racing to out-innovate each other by offering new features and platforms that take advantage of the hottest tech trend in years. And Wall Street wants to know how all those AI apps are going to pay off.\n\nTo that end, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and others are increasingly looking for ways to monetize their AI efforts. Case in point, during its annual Google Cloud Next developers conference this week, Google announced its latest paid generative AI service: AI classification for its Workspace productivity suite designed to boost user security.\n\nThe AI classification is an add-on for Google’s Workspace Business and Workspace Enterprise, which cost $20 per user per month and $30 per user per month, respectively, that adds $10 per user per month.\n\nAccording to Google Workspace vice president of product management Yulie Kwon Kim, the feature is designed to automatically classify important documents within organizations to prevent them from being shared, copied, or otherwise leaked to the public.\n\n“We use this feature here at Google, and it helps us identify and classify 900 million internal files,” Kim told Yahoo Finance. “So, this has boosted ... our data protection capabilities, improving accuracy, dramatically increasing coverage, and saving team members a lot of time, and this solves a problem that every organization has out there.”\n\nKim was also sure to note that while rival Microsoft has been dealing with security foul-ups with its Exchange service, including one from 2023 that a Department of Homeland Security report recently blamed on a “cascade of security failures at the Windows maker,” Google’s Workspace hasn’t had any such issues. A Google corporate logo hangs above the entrance to their office at St. John's Terminal on March 31, 2024, in New York City.

And this number was zero for Google workspace,” she said.\n\nIn addition to its AI classification add-on, Google says it’s also using large language models, the foundation of today’s generative AI platforms, to cut down on spam in Gmail. The company rolled out the service, which Kim referred to as AI anti-threat defense software, in late 2023 but held off on announcing it until its Next conference so that it had time to use it on its own platform.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We block 20% more spam in Gmail [with the new tool]. We are able to review 1,000 times more user reported spam in Gmail every day,” Kim said. “So that's basically like adding 1,000 cyber defenders to our team.” Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Kim, Google’s effort is like fighting fire with fire. While generative AI apps can be used to generate phishing emails, they can also catch emails created using generative AI, because it can tell what messages were written using the technology.\n\nGoogle isn’t the only company monetizing its generative AI apps. Microsoft is also asking enterprise customers to pony up $30 per month for access to its Copilot for Microsoft 365 platform. It also sells its Copilot for Security service, as well as a host of generative AI-powered features for Azure\n\nAs companies continue rolling out generative AI apps and services, they’ll need to ensure that they not only pay for themselves but also bring in huge amounts of revenue.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Epic Games proposes Google app store reforms after antitrust win",
        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) -“Fortnite” video game maker Epic Games has urged a federal judge in California to force Google to open up its Play Store to greater competition after a jury found the U.S. tech giant had abused its power as a gatekeeper for apps on the Android mobile platform.\n\nEpic made its proposal in a court filing on Thursday to U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco, seeking in part to require Google Play Store to allow users more freedom in how they download apps and to limit Google's ability to make agreements with device makers to restrict preloading of competing app stores.\n\nEpic said in a statement on Friday it should be allowed to bring its Epic Games Store to Android \"without delays and barriers.\" The company also said consumers and developers must have greater control over \"how they make and offer in-app purchases, free from anticompetitive fees and restrictions.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nResponding to Epic, Google in a statement on Friday said the court filing \"shows again that [Epic] simply wants the benefits of Google Play without having to pay for it.\" Google said \"Android is an open mobile platform that faces fierce competition\" from Apple and other competitors.\n\nDonato presided over a blockbuster antitrust trial that ended in a jury verdict against Alphabet-owned Google in December.\n\nDonato is not bound to grant Epic's proposal, and a hard fight is likely before any permanent order on Google is issued. But the new filing sets up the next key test of Google's ability to impose controls on app developers and consumers.\n\nThe jury in December said Google unlawfully impeded developers' ability to freely distribute their apps outside of Google’s Play Store and kept an overly tight grip on payments for transactions within apps. Google imposes an industry standard 30% commission on many apps and in-app purchases.\n\nGoogle has defended its app store practices and denied any wrongdoing. The company has a May 3 deadline to respond to Epic’s proposal. Epic’s lawsuit did not demand monetary damages.\n\nStory continues\n\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney has said Google's December settlement did not go far enough to restore Play Store competition.\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games is a privately held company, in which China's Tencent owns a 40% stake and Walt Disney owns a stake of about 9% as of February.\n\nGoogle separately in December agreed to pay $700 million to resolve state and consumer allegations over its Play Store restrictions.\n\nThe company said then it was expanding the ability of app and game developers to provide consumers an alternative billing option for in-app purchases. Google said it had piloted \"choice billing\" in the U.S. for more than a year.\n\nGoogle has said it will appeal the December antitrust jury verdict, and it can separately challenge any reforms ordered by Donato, which could stretch the case for years.\n\nA similar case Epic lodged against Apple in 2020, challenging its grip on its App Store, is still being fought after a non-jury trial and appeals.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella in Washington and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Sharon Singleton, Susan Fenton and David Bario)",

        "content": "General Motors’ GM self-driving vehicle subsidiary, Cruise, is set to resume its operation with a small fleet of human-driven vehicles in Phoenix, AZ, after six months.\r\n\r\nThe company suspended its operation in October, following an accident in which a pedestrian was dragged by Cruise robotaxi after being hit by a different vehicle. After the incident, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a recall for the company’s vehicles.\r\n\r\nPer the company, Cruise is relaunching manual driving to create maps and collect road information in select cities, starting in Phoenix. The vehicle will operate with human drivers with no intervention from the autonomous system.\r\n\r\nThe relaunch of vehicles with human drivers will play a crucial role in validating the company’s self-driving systems as it braces to return to its driverless mission. Cruise did not disclose the timeline for resuming its driverless operation.\r\n\r\nPer Cruise, after halting the operations in October, it has been focusing on rebuilding trust with regulators and communities that it serves to redesign its approach to safety. Under the supervision of new leadership, suggestions from third-party experts and close partnerships with communities in which the company’s vehicles operate, Cruise has made significant improvements. \r\n\r\nBefore the incident, Cruise was aiming to aggressively expand its robotaxi outside its home market. After the incident, the company’s co-founders, including CEO Kyle Vogt, resigned and nine other leaders were dismissed. The company reduced its workforce by 24%.\r\n\r\nBeside GM’s Cruise, Alphabet’s GOOG autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, and Tesla, Inc. TSLA are working on self-driving services.\r\n\r\nWaymo currently operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is ramping up production in Austin, TX. It has signed a multi-year partnership with Uber and will provide its robotaxi to the food delivery company to deliver food in Arizona.\r\n\r\nTesla recently announced to launch its robotaxi on Aug 8, 2024. The robotaxi reportedly utilizes TSLA’s latest vehicle platform. In April 2019, Tesla planned to start operating its robotaxis by 2020. The car was expected to last for 11 years and drive one million miles, helping the company and car operators earn a profit of $30,000 each year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The CMA said it wanted to learn from the past in digital markets where a winner-takes-all dynamic led to the rise of a small number of all-powerful platforms.\n\n“When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive officer of the CMA, said.\n\nThe CMA’s remarks reflect concerns around how the biggest US tech companies have potential concern is how the biggest US tech companies have acquired stakes in many of the most promising AI startups, deals that involve both funding and strategic access to infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft is OpenAI’s biggest backer, has invested in French AI startup Mistral and recently hired most of the team from Inflection AI. Google, owner of the AI lab DeepMind, has invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, as has Amazon. Chipmaker Nvidia has backed dozens of startups, including large language model startup Cohere.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch deals may attract less regulatory scrutiny than full acquisitions, though the EU is probing Microsoft over the nature of its relationship to OpenAI and Mistral. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s antitrust chief also said Thursday that AI is going to change the marketplace and regulators need to be vigilant.\n\n“We see a lot of entrenched market power when it comes to technology,” Vestager said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “It’s really important that now when we have technology, which is not just a new technology but is basically a new world that we’re looking into, that we make sure it’s a competitive new world.”\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission also launched inquiries into Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft’s AI partners. The CMA also has a separate initial investigation into Microsoft’s OpenAI investment.\n\nRead More: Big Tech’s Year of Partnering Up With AI Startups\n\nThe CMA will be assessing the market over the coming months and may use existing merger and investigations reviews to intervene.

        "title": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the benefits of AI 'will astound us all'",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy is finally going all in on generative AI. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, the Amazon chief said the technology is the company’s next major product opportunity, up there with Marketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nJassy also laid out why Amazon is uniquely positioned to thrive in the age of generative AI, explaining how the company has all of the pieces in place to be the go-to tech firm for both enterprise customers’ and consumers’ generative AI needs.\n\n“The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all,” Jassy wrote in his letter. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.”\n\nAmazon has kept a relatively low profile when it comes to generative AI compared to the likes Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which have spent the last year boasting about their AI offerings and debuting new generative AI-powered products and services.\n\nBut Amazon has been investing heavily in the technology, including pouring $4 billion into AI startup Anthropic, which has become a kind of flagship offering for the company akin to how Microsoft positions its relationship with OpenAI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during the New York Times DealBook Summit in the Appel Room at the Jazz At Lincoln Center on November 30, 2022 . (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nNow, Jassy seems ready to push Amazon as a major generative AI player like its rivals. That includes laying out the company’s approach to the technology from the chips used to train and run AI models to apps like its Rufus chatbot for Amazon’s Marketplace and Amazon Q, which writes and debugs code for AWS users.\n\nIn his letter, Jassy touted Amazon’s investments in its Graviton CPU chips, as well as its Trainium chip for training AI models and Inferentia chip for inferencing those models, as key offerings that set Amazon apart from the competition. Inferencing refers to using AI models to complete tasks.\n\nAnd while Jassy said that Amazon offers a vast array of Nvidia (NVDA) chips to its customers for training and deploying AI models, he positioned Amazon’s chips as viable alternatives that can meet customers’ needs at a time when Nvidia’s chips are in short supply and the price to run AI models soars.\n\nStory continues\n\nJassy also appeared to take a shot at his Big Tech rivals when it comes to the AI models themselves, saying that Amazon offers models from a slew of companies including Anthropic, Stability AI, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, and Amazon’s own models, rather than just one major AI model. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“Customers don’t want only one model,” Jassy said. “They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications.”\n\nWhile Microsoft and Google offer multiple AI models to their enterprise customers, the companies have spent much of their time hyping their respective AI platforms. Microsoft regularly points to its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI as a major factor that differentiates it from other Big Tech firms, while Google is focused on rolling out and hyping its Gemini foundation models.\n\nJassy also pointed to Amazon’s efforts to build its own generative AI apps including its Amazon Q platform for AWS developers and Rufus chatbot. I used an early version of Rufus, and while I found it helpful in some respects, it’s also still prone to errors when answering some queries.\n\nNow that Amazon is going full force into the generative AI realm, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft and Google respond. We’ll find out more when both companies host their respective developer conferences next month.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

His tenure has been characterized by rolling layoffs, cost cuts and product shutdowns as the company adjusted to slower growth coming out of the pandemic. That differentiates him from Bezos, who plowed revenue into moonshot projects in between bouts of frugality.\n\nThe company began cutting hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services division, Bloomberg News reported earlier in April. In his letter, Jassy said AWS will be at the core of AI applications and models and “help democratize this next seminal phase of AI.”\n\nJassy has focused the company’s investments on a few big initiatives such as building data centers to help fuel the artificial intelligence boom and efforts to develop build out an Amazon franchise in groceries and health care. Those were the focus of his letter a year ago. In his first letter to investors as Amazon boss, he pledged to reduce injury rates among the company’s workers.\n\n“AI may be largest technology transformation since the cloud” or possibly the internet, he said in the most recent missive. “The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon also added artificial intelligence expertise to its board. Andrew Ng, who helped found Alphabet Inc.’s Google Brain and was formerly chief scientist for Baidu Inc., became a director earlier this week, the company said.\n\nJudith McGrath, a board member since 2014, won’t stand for reelection in 2024, the company said.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are becoming more optimistic about Alphabet Inc.’s artificial intelligence strategy, after a run of glitches and misfires that sent its shares tumbling.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Vietnam Tycoon Lan Sentenced to Death Over $12 Billion Fraud Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick\n\nThe stock is heading back toward what would be a record $2 trillion market value — a milestone surpassed only by Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. in the United States. It has rallied back from last month’s low, when the shares dropped on concerns the company was falling behind in AI.\n\nUsing this week’s cloud event to show that its AI model is enterprise-ready despite recent stumbles in its consumer-facing tools, focus is now turning to this month’s earnings and a developer’s conference in May. While Alphabet’s path to AI monetization is still seen as cloudy, the stock’s relatively cheap valuation has kept it attractive to many on Wall Street.\n\n“While the headlines haven’t been favorable, Google’s role in generative AI products will present massive growth opportunities for the stock,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief executive officer at Defiance ETFs. Alphabet is also set to benefit from making its own generative AI tools that can power more precise ads and increase revenues from ad spend, she added.\n\nAlphabet’s misfiring Gemini product had been viewed as a major setback for a firm known for its technological prowess, with the company in February pausing an image generation feature that drew criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race.\n\nThe company’s cloud computing conference in Las Vegas this week offered investors some reassurance, as the firm showed how Gemini can be used to create advertisements, prevent cybersecurity threats and spin up short videos and podcasts. Google also showed a new chip designed to handle AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nNews that Apple Inc. is considering using Google’s Gemini technology to power AI services added more fuel to the rebound. Up to the last close, shares are up 12% this year.\n\n“Google’s hardware advances, Gemini progress, and AI driven app demos should help sentiment on AI capabilities,” Bank of Amercia Corp. analyst Justin Post wrote in a note Tuesday. “We see Cloud as positive driver for stock given AI credibility, faster growth, improving margins.”\n\nThe stock trades at 21 times forward earnings, below Microsoft’s 33 times, and about the same as the S&P 500 Index.\n\nRead more: Alphabet’s AI Missteps Are Opportunity For One Fund Manager\n\nStill, not all are convinced by the discount, despite “plenty of people that are making the argument that it’s so cheap right now,” said Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Opportunity Fund.\n\nGiven the competitive search space, Alphabet “should be investing every single dollar at a higher ROI (return on investment) into their own businesses,” he said.\n\nFor now, the company’s updates have at least offered investors some encouragement. JP Morgan Chase & Co. analyst Doug Anmuth noting this week that he expected Gemini integration to result in more than 20% revenue growth for Google Cloud.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nOpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman has been working to build a global coalition among government and industry leaders to support boosting the supply of chips, energy and data center capacity needed to develop artificial intelligence technology. SpaceX’s prized Starlink satellite business is still burning through more cash than it brings in. Adobe Inc. has begun to procure videos to build its artificial intelligence text-to-video generator, trying to catch up to competitors after OpenAI demonstrated a similar technology. French chip materials company Soitec is considering building a factory in the US, as customers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. win government incentives for significant expansions from Arizona to Texas. Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said his company’s cloud infrastructure will become an essential part of the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Bill Ackman Owns $1.9 Billion Worth of This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably the world's most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stock, as evidenced by its 215% gain in the past year alone. It's not a claim without merit, because the company's revenue more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 28) on the back of its industry-leading AI data center chips.\n\nBut if investors want to know where the AI industry is headed next, it can be helpful to know where billionaires are putting their money. Bill Ackman, for example, manages a $10 billion stock portfolio for his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, and he doesn't own Nvidia at all.\n\nInstead, Ackman owns a $1.9 billion position in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Not only has he made solid gains on that investment already, but the stock is also still cheap and could be poised for further upside thanks to the company's AI initiatives.\n\nHere's why it's not too late for investors to follow Ackman's lead. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nMicrosoft created an opportunity for Ackman to buy Alphabet\n\nIt's no coincidence Bill Ackman bought Alphabet stock in the first quarter of 2023 when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced its $10 billion investment in leading AI startup OpenAI. Microsoft quickly integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its Bing search engine, in an attempt to disrupt Google's 91% market share in the internet search industry.\n\nTraditional search engines like Google typically make the user sift through web pages for the information they need, whereas Bing's new chatbot interface can instantly provide a direct answer to almost any question. It's a far more convenient experience. Alphabet stock plunged because investors feared the company fell way behind Microsoft on the AI front, but Ackman viewed that as a buying opportunity.\n\nIn a recent interview with David Rubenstein, Ackman said Alphabet's valuation had fallen so much that he was getting a great deal on the company's existing businesses, like search and YouTube, while getting its AI initiatives basically for free.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's interesting to note that Ackman felt Alphabet's AI technology was neck-and-neck with OpenAI's when he made the investment, even though Alphabet hadn't launched its own AI chatbot yet.\n\nAlphabet's Gemini now outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models\n\nShortly after Microsoft announced its OpenAI investment, Alphabet reminded investors it had been working on AI for years. After all, Google acquired AI startup DeepMind way back in 2014. That's why it took only a few months to launch Google Bard, a chatbot designed to compete directly with ChatGPT.\n\nThe quality of a generative AI application comes down to the quality of the developer's data, and since Google has been the window to the internet for decades, it arguably has more useful information with which to build AI applications than any other company.\n\nBard paved the way for Alphabet's latest and greatest family of AI models called Gemini, which were launched in December. According to Alphabet, Gemini outperforms OpenAI's most advanced GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, it's capable of interpreting and generating text content, images, videos, and computer code more accurately.\n\nAlphabet announced the release of Gemini 1.5, which is even more advanced, in February. The company says it's far better at \"in-context learning,\" meaning it can learn new skills from users' prompts without needing additional fine-tuning from developers. In one test, Alphabet gave Gemini 1.5 a grammar manual for a rare language called Kalamang -- which has fewer than 200 speakers worldwide -- and it could translate it at a similar level to human subjects who used the same learning material.\n\nGemini is now available as a standalone chatbot, but its technology is also woven into the traditional Google Search engine to feed users text-based responses in their search results. That reduces the amount of time users have to spend clicking through to third-party web pages for the information they need, striking a balance between traditional search and the chatbot experience.\n\nAckman is sitting on big gains, but Alphabet stock can still go higher\n\nAckman bought the bulk of Pershing Square's Alphabet position in the first quarter of 2023, at an estimated average price of $96.56. That implies he's sitting on a 60% gain based on the stock's current price of $154.85. Ackman added to his holdings in the second and third quarters of 2023, and he's sitting on a profit on those positions, too. But it isn't too late for investors to follow his lead, because the stock is still relatively cheap.\n\nAlphabet generated a record $307.4 billion in revenue in 2023, with $5.80 in earnings per share (that is, profit). The latter places Alphabet stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7. That means Alphabet is the second-cheapest stock among the six U.S. tech giants valued at $1 trillion or more: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe advertising dollars generated by Google Search still account for most of Alphabet's revenue. However, Google Cloud is the company's fastest-growing segment thanks to its growing portfolio of AI services. Businesses and developers can access the latest data center infrastructure and ready-made large language models, including Gemini, on Google Cloud to build their own AI applications.\n\nAlphabet is also weaving Gemini into its other products, such as Google Docs and Gmail, offering a productivity boost to customers who can now use AI to rapidly craft content in those applications. Longer-term, Alphabet is reportedly negotiating with Apple to make Gemini the default AI chatbot on that company's devices, including the iPhone. Details are scarce, but it could be an incredible opportunity, considering Apple has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices worldwide.\n\nI think Ackman made a spectacular bet on Alphabet, and his $1.9 billion position is likely to continue to grow in value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Granth Vanaik\n\n(Reuters) - Google will invest $1 billion to improve digital connectivity between the U.S. and Japan through two new subsea cables, the Alphabet-owned firm said on Wednesday amid a visit by the Japanese prime minister to boost ties between the countries.\n\nThe two subsea cables, Proa and Taihei, will improve connectivity between the U.S., Japan and multiple Pacific island countries and territories, Google said in a blog post.\n\n\"Building on the U.S.-Australia joint funding commitment for subsea cables last October, the United States and Japan plan to collaborate with like-minded partners to build trusted and more resilient networks and intend to contribute funds to provide subsea cables in the Pacific region,\" a United States-Japan joint statement said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Pacific region has become a great area of interest for China and the U.S., who are jostling for influence in the zone with competing offers for infrastructure and military partnerships.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has pushed for U.S. dominance in telecommunications services, seeing the industry as a key national security issue due to its control over information flows worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. pledged last year to jointly fund two undersea cables, to be built by Google, connecting the U.S. territory of Guam with hubs in Fiji and French Polynesia, and further branching out across remote Pacific Islands.\n\nGoogle said the Proa subsea cable would connect the U.S., Japan, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam, while the Taihei subsea cable would connect the U.S., Japan and Hawaii.\n\nAdditionally, Google said it would fund the construction of an interlink cable connecting Hawaii, the CNMI and Guam.\n\nThe tech giant also said it would work in collaboration with Japanese-based companies - including KDDI, Arteria Networks, Philippines-based Citadel Pacific and the CNMI - to improve the digital connectivity in the region.\n\nSubsea cables are the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world's data traffic.\n\n(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "content": "It’s been both fascinating and alarming to watch the generative AI explosion unfold. A new, interesting technology has captured the public’s imagination thanks to its ability to generate everything from text to video. But there are fears those same capabilities make it a potential threat to a host of jobs ranging from programmers and artists to human resources workers and financial professionals.\n\nThere’s little doubt generative AI will impact some jobs. According to Intel, we could eventually see the rise of AI technologies so powerful they’ll replace entire corporate departments. But the generative AI job-pocalypse won’t destroy every job it touches. As with all things, it’s a bit more complicated than that. And the truth is, there’s still a lot we don’t know.\n\n“It is going to be a major disruption that unfolds over many years, at least 10 years,” Columbia Business School professor Daniel Keum told Yahoo Finance. “And it'll create losers and winners. But what that exactly looks like, we don't know.”\n\nAccording to experts, generative AI will make some jobs easier, while creating others. The thinking is similar to how the internet and e-commerce displaced some positions while helping to bring about entirely new categories of jobs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella are championing AI in the workplace. (AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“It might be an existential threat to a very narrow set of jobs just like any technology,” explained professor Sonny Tambe, co-director of The Wharton School’s AI at Wharton program.And we’ve seen these kinds of changes before.\n\n“Even something much more general purpose like, say, a tractor, has a large impact on a narrow set of jobs,” Tambe said. “For most of us, I think it is actually a really useful tool, but not an existential threat, necessarily.”\n\nWe still don’t know what jobs are most at risk\n\nAccording to a July Pew Research Center report, 19% of jobs will have some kind of exposure to generative AI. That means AI will augment some parts of those positions, though not necessarily replace them.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperts I spoke with said customer service workers, tax preparers, and others could face pressure as companies begin using generative AI-powered chatbots to answer customer queries or instantly fill documents. However, if you’ve used a chatbot to try to get a comprehensive answer to questions about anything from your health insurance to how to return a shirt, you know they can be frustratingly ineffective.\n\nHarvard Business School professor Andy Wu says generative AI could lead to the creation of programs that respond to voice directions. According to Wu, users could someday control complex apps like Adobe’s (ADBE) Photoshop using natural language instructions, meaning rather than clicking through menus to edit photos, they’ll simply be able to tell apps how they want an image to look.\n\nThat could help photo editors by making their jobs easier or give middle managers an easy reason to replace them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays shows off the company's latest AI chips at Nvidia GDC 2024. (Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, many of these tools are still flawed as well. Generative AI images feature glaring errors like people with oddly placed hands or Google’s multicultural Nazis. Generative AI chatbots are also prone to hallucinations, a fancy term for errors that seem authoritative. Even AI transcription apps often pick up the wrong words.\n\nNew jobs will emerge\n\nJust as AI is all but certain to impact some jobs, it will also help create new opportunities. Take the Photoshop app example. By making apps and services more easy to access, more people can begin using them, bringing more creativity into various fields.\n\nWith the advent of blogs and social networks, more people than ever can share their thoughts with the world, something you previously needed a media organization to do.\n\nAnd with the development of large graphics engines from the likes of Unity and Epic, individual programmers can develop their own games rather than relying on an entire fleet of developers. That doesn’t mean programmers for big-name games have gone away, but rather that gamers can now get access to both highly polished major game releases and independent games.\n\nIt will take time before we feel the full impact of AI\n\nWhether good or bad, it’ll likely be some time before we feel the full force of generative AI’s impact on the job market. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“If you look at the data, less than 10% of US firms report that they've adopted [generative AI] in some fashion, and probably still in an experimental phase,” Pew Research Center senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar told Yahoo Finance. “So we don't know. It’s too early to say which way things are going.”\n\nOf course, if you listen to Big Tech companies ranging from Nvidia and Microsoft to Google and Intel, we’ll start feeling generative AI’s changes any day now. But the reality is that it will still take years, if not more, to sort out the technology’s impact on the job market.\n\nRemember how self-driving trucks were supposed to steal truckers’ jobs? That’s still far from reality. And early predictions that self-driving cars would be ferrying us around by now? Those have fallen decidedly flat.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department is scrutinizing whether artificial intelligence companies have overlapping executives or directors, an arrangement that can violate US antitrust law, a senior agency official said Wednesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nThe Justice Department is “on the lookout for AI competitors sharing board members,” Andrew Forman, deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, said at a conference in Washington. Taking quick action to enforce rules while the industry is still developing can have competitive benefits, he said, “and that’s something that we’re particularly focused on.”\n\nUS antitrust law bars so-called interlocking directorates, in which individuals or entities sit on the board of directors for two companies that directly compete with one another. The Biden administration has stepped up enforcement against these interlocks, forcing directors to step down from the boards of companies such as Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Nextdoor Holdings Inc.\n\nThe AI industry has spurred particular concern among antitrust enforcers because many of the most promising startups depend heavily on the old guard of tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\n\nOver the past several months, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have spent billions of dollars investing in AI startups — a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world’s cloud-computing giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Windows maker has subsequently invested 15 million euros in French AI startup Mistral and hired Inflection co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, along with most of that startup’s 70 employees.\n\nGoogle committed to back AI startup Anthropic with $2 billion in October, and Amazon agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion last year. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business.\n\nThe Biden DOJ’s enforcement efforts have unwound or prevented interlocks involving at least two dozen companies.\n\nThe Justice Department has previously said it has opened a number of probes into competition in artificial intelligence.\n\n(Adds DOJ enforcement numbers. An earlier version corrected Microsoft’s investment in Mistral.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Airbus and 15 other EU companies have criticised a proposal that would allow Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft to bid for highly sensitive EU cloud computing contracts.\n\nThe draft plan from Belgium, which currently holds the rotating European Union presidency, concerns a certification scheme (EUCS) to vouch for the cybersecurity of cloud services and help governments and companies in the bloc to pick a secure and trusted vendor for their business.\n\nThe proposal scraps so-called sovereignty requirements from a previous draft which obliged U.S. tech giants to set up a joint venture with an EU-based company to store and process customer data in the bloc to qualify for the EU cybersecurity label.\n\nThe Belgian plan will be discussed by cybersecurity experts from the 27 EU countries on March 15, which could pave the way for the European Commission to adopt the cybersecurity scheme in the northern hemisphere autumn.\n\nEU countries should reject this latest proposal without sovereignty requirements, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Airbus and the other 15 companies said in a joint letter to authorities in their countries and to senior Commission officials.\n\n\"The inclusion of EU-HQ and European control requirements in the main scheme is necessary to mitigate the risk of unlawful data access on the basis of foreign laws,\" they said in the letter seen by Reuters.\n\nWithout such requirements, European data could be accessed by foreign governments on the basis of their laws such as the U.S. Cloud Act or the Chinese National Intelligence Law, they warned.\n\nBig Tech is looking to the lucrative government cloud market to spur growth while the EU on the other hand fears illegal state surveillance and the dominance of U.S. cloud providers.\n\nThe EU companies said the EU cybersecurity label should follow the example of Europe's Gaia-X cloud computing platform created to reduce the EU's dependence on Silicon Valley giants and which has sovereignty requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey said the lack of sovereignty clauses could also hamper nascent EU cloud providers versus their bigger U.S. rivals.\n\n\"Removing such requirements from the scheme would seriously undermine the viability of sovereign cloud solutions in Europe – many of which are either in development or already available on the market,\" the companies said.\n\nSignatories to the joint letter include French power group EDF, French cloud services provider OVHcloud and Italian peer Aruba, Dassault Systemes, Germany's Ionos, Telecom Italia, Austria's Exoscale, French tech company Capgemini and Eutelsat.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "content": "Although Wall Street offers few guarantees, short-term volatility is one of them. Since the curtain opened on 2020, Wall Street's three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years (through 2023).\n\nWhen equities are getting whipsawed by uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to seek the safety of industry-leading stocks, such as the companies that make up the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPatient investors have gravitated to the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. Listed in descending order of current market cap (as of April 5, 2024), these seven titans are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two defining traits that have made the Magnificent Seven such popular holdings for investors. To start with, they're undeniable outperformers. Over the trailing decade, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a rock-solid 182%. Comparatively, Nvidia's stock has zoomed higher by approximately 19,230%, the shares of Amazon and Tesla have gained more than 1,000%, and Alphabet is bringing up the caboose with a gain of \"only\" 464% from its Class A shares (GOOGL). MSFT Chart\n\nThe other reason investors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven is because they all offer clearly defined competitive advantages or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure service platform Azure ranks second in global market share. Meanwhile, Windows remains the clear leader in desktop operating systems. Apple's iPhone has accounted for a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable versions in 2020. Apple also has the largest share repurchase program on Wall Street. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for a 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon sits at the top of the pack in e-commerce and among cloud infrastructure service platforms. Its e-commerce marketplace oversaw nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) gobbled up a 31% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the September-ended quarter. Alphabet's Google has a virtual monopoly in global internet search, with a 91% share in March 2024. Alphabet is also the parent of the second-most-visited social network (YouTube) and the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms' social media networks attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) during the December-ended quarter. This includes Facebook, which alone lured in 3.07 billion MAUs. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's been generating a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced almost 1.85 million EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors have been selling all but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nBut in spite of the overwhelming success of the Magnificent Seven, many of Wall Street's most prominent billionaire investors began kicking these outperformers to the curb during the December-ended quarter.\n\nAll told, six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks were either jettisoned from billionaires' portfolios or meaningfully pared down, including:\n\nNvidia: Eight highly successful billionaire money managers reduced their positions in this AI titan, with Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold), Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold), and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) leading the way. Microsoft: Seven accomplished billionaires were sellers of Microsoft stock in the December-ended quarter, including Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares sold) and Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares sold), who both closed out their respective funds' positions. Alphabet: Seven top-tier billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Alphabet during the fourth quarter. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont (3,302,342 shares sold), Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel (3,113,001 shares sold), and Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman (1,278,300 shares sold) were the respective top sellers. Meta Platforms: Six tenured billionaires gave shares of Meta the boot in the quarter ended in December. The top sellers included Jeff Yass of Susquehanna (3,037,082 shares sold) and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global (1,430,767 shares sold). Apple: Four respected billionaire money managers reduced their stakes in Apple during the fourth quarter. This included Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who oversaw the sale of a little over 10 million shares of Apple. Tesla: A total of three well-known billionaire investors sold shares of EV maker Tesla in the final quarter of 2023. Billionaires John Overdeck and David Siegel, who co-founded Two Sigma Investments, saw their funds sell all 1,015,385 shares of Tesla they'd owned as of the previous quarter.\n\nThe one name missing from this list, and the only Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires are absolutely piling into, is e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the fourth quarter, eight billionaires added shares of Amazon to their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why billionaire investors can't stop buying Amazon stock\n\nIf you're wondering why billionaires are buying shares of Amazon stock while paring down or exiting their stakes in the other Magnificent Seven stocks, look no further than Amazon's trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments: AWS, advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates very low margins. The bulk of the cash flow and operating income Amazon produces come from its trio of ancillary segments.\n\nNone of these segments is more important than AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit sales growth should be the expectation for AWS. Even though this segment only accounted for a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it provided about two-thirds of its operating income.\n\nAmazon's advertising operations are another source of sustained growth. In a typical month, Amazon's website is the destination for well over 2 billion visitors, many of whom are motivated shoppers. This makes Amazon one of the primary platforms that merchants want to target when getting their message(s) in front of consumers.\n\nThe third key operating division is subscription services. The last time Amazon updated its global Prime subscription count was April 2021, when then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company had surpassed 200 million. With Amazon gaining the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, there's a high likelihood this subscription total has jumped further.\n\nCollectively, the lure of these higher-growth segments is their cash flow generation. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock. Patient investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for just 13 times consensus cash flow in 2025. Even approaching its previous all-time high, Amazon stock is historically inexpensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven,\" All Eyes Should Be on the \"Fab Four\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the broader market last year. This group of the world's largest technology companies impressed with 2023 returns ranging between 48% and 238%. That's impressive for companies already worth trillions of dollars in some cases!\n\nBut 2024 has represented a changing of the guard of sorts. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have hit some headwinds. The remaining group of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) continue to rally, resembling a new group, a \"Fab Four\" that continues to carry the market to all-time highs.\n\nCan they continue to separate themselves from the pack?\n\nForget the Magnificent Seven and embrace the Fab Four. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA changing of the guard in 2024\n\nApple, Tesla, and Alphabet haven't kept up the pace since 2024 began. Alphabet's year-to-date gains have \"only\" tracked the S&P 500, while Apple and Tesla have started to slide. Apple and Tesla are reporting hiccups in their growth efforts. Tesla's deliveries began 2024 with a thud, while Apple is dealing with weakness in China, a vital market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Alphabet is experiencing its first threat to its monopoly on search engine traffic from generative artificial intelligence (AI). AAPL Chart\n\nThese massive companies can't maintain these tremendous investment returns if they don't deliver the performance to back up those high expectations. Analysts have dramatically soured on Tesla's near-term growth outlook, and Apple's valuation got too hot for the growth it was putting on the table.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" enjoy growth tailwinds\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven form the Fab Four, thanks primarily to expected tailwinds from artificial intelligence over the coming years. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, which are needed to power the massive computer systems that run AI. Amazon and Microsoft operate the world's two largest cloud platforms, the underpinnings of the internet, and what will be various AI applications. Lastly, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI for digital advertising while investing heavily in augmented reality.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth these opportunities will create, calling for annualized long-term earnings growth ranging from 15% to 35% over the next three to five years.\n\nValuations say the momentum can continue\n\nHow much you pay for a stock always matters. It's not that Tesla, Alphabet, and Apple can't succeed in the future, but their valuations have become too disconnected from what the market expects growth to look like.\n\nInvestors can use the PEG ratio to compare a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth to determine whether shares are still a good value. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf you use the data from the above charts, the Fab Four have the following PEG ratios:\n\nNvidia: 1 Amazon: 1.9 Microsoft: 2.4 Meta: 1.3\n\nThe lower the PEG ratio is, the better the value. I generally look to buy when PEG ratios are under 1.5, so Nvidia and Meta remain excellent deals if they can deliver the growth analysts expect from them. Amazon is a bit more expensive but is a more capital-intensive company. If you price the stock to its operating cash flow, its valuation is still below its decade average. Admittedly, Microsoft is beginning to look expensive, so investors may want to think twice before buying shares.\n\nAll the companies in the Magnificent Seven are among the best in their respective industries and could easily be long-term winners. But the cream eventually rises to the top, which could be Nvidia and Meta Platforms based on the numbers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee\n\nSTOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies.\n\nThe early results come after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act, which aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers from a \"choice screen.\"\n\nBrowsers are software that help users connect to the internet and are traditionally offered by big technology companies like Apple and Google for free in exchange for tracking which websites consumers visit and selling advertisement to them.\n\nIn mobile devices that run Android, Chrome browser comes as default and iPhones with Safari, making them the dominant browsers in the market.\n\nCyprus-based Aloha Browser said users in the EU jumped 250% in March - one of the first companies to give monthly growth numbers since the new regulations came in.\n\nFounded in 2016, Aloha, which markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers owned by big tech, has 10 million monthly average users and earns money through paid subscriptions, rather than selling ads by tracking users.\n\n\"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,\" Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview.\n\nNorway's Vivaldi, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have also seen user numbers rise following the new regulation.\n\nU.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its bigger rival, Norway-based Opera are also seeing growth in users, but said the choice screen rollout is still not complete.\n\n\"We are experiencing record user numbers in the EU right now,\" said Jan Standal, vice president at Opera, which counts over 324 million global users.\n\nStory continues\n\nCHOSEN ONES\n\nUnder the new EU rules, mobile software makers are required to show a choice screen where users can select a browser, search engine and virtual assistant as they set up their phones.\n\nPreviously, tech companies such as Apple and Google loaded phones with default settings that included their preferred services, such as the voice assistant Siri for iPhones. Changing these settings required a more complicated process.\n\nApple is now showing up to 11 browsers in addition to Safari in the choice screens curated for each of the 27 countries in the EU, and will update those screens once every year for each country.\n\nWhile DuckDuckGo and Opera are offered in Apple's list in all 27 countries, Aloha is in 26 countries, Ecosia is in 13 and Vivaldi in 8.\n\nGoogle is currently showing browser choices on devices made by the company and said new devices made by other companies running Android operating system will also display choice screen in the coming months.\n\nA Google spokesperson said they do not have data on choice screens to share yet.\n\nAs iPhones have a bigger market share than Google-branded phones, the growth for smaller browsers is currently coming at the cost of Safari.\n\nOpera said most of the positive trends are from people making Opera the default browser on their iPhones.\n\nBut browser companies criticized how Apple and Google rolled out the new features which they described as slow and clunky, and they believe are slowing the migration of mobile users to new browser choices.\n\nMozilla, which owns Firefox browser, estimates that only 19% of iPhone users in the region received an update in a roll-out that appeared much slower than previous software updates, the company said.\n\nIn iPhones, users can see the choice screen only when they click Safari, and then users are shown a list of browsers with no additional information, said Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, CEO of Norway's Vivaldi.\n\n\"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name,\" he said.\n\nThe complicated design has led European Commission to start a non-compliance investigation into whether Apple may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm and Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by Kenneth Li and Daniel Wallis)",

        "title": "Longtime AI critic Gary Marcus sees a ‘Shakespearean tragedy’ as widespread scraping of copyrighted data comes to light in bombshell report",
        "content": "Gary Marcus is a leading AI researcher who’s increasingly appalled at what he’s seeing. He founded at least two AI startups, one of which sold to Uber, and has been researching the subject for over two decades. Just last weekend, the Financial Times called him “perhaps the noisiest AI questioner” and reported that Marcus assumed he was targeted by a critical Sam Altman post on X: “Give me the confidence of a mediocre deep-learning skeptic.”\n\nMarcus doubled down on his critique the very next day after he appeared in the FT,writing on his Substack about “generative AI as Shakespearean tragedy.” The subject was a bombshell report from the New York Times that OpenAI violated YouTube’s terms of service by scraping over a million hours of user-generated content. What’s worse, Google’s need for data to train its own AI model was so insatiable that it did the same thing, potentially violating the copyrights of the content creators whose videos it used without their consent.\n\nAs far back as 2018, Marcus noted, he has expressed doubts about the “data-guzzling” approach to training that sought to feed AI models with as much content as possible. In fact, he listed eight of his warnings, dating all the way back to his diagnosis of hallucinations in 2001, all coming true like a curse on Macbeth or Hamlet manifesting in the fifth act. “What makes all this tragic is that many of us have tried so hard to warn the field that we would wind up here,” Marcus wrote.\n\nWhile Marcus declined to comment to Fortune, the tragedy goes well beyond the fact that nobody listened to critics like him and Ed Zitron, another prominent skeptic cited by the FT. According to the Times, which cites numerous background sources, both Google and OpenAI knew what they were doing was legally dubious—banking on the fact that copyright in the age of AI had yet to be litigated—but felt they had no choice but to keep pumping data into their large language models to stay ahead of their competition. And in Google’s case, it potentially suffered harm as a result of OpenAI’s massive scraping efforts, but its own bending of the rules to scrape the very same data left it with a proverbial arm tied behind its back.\n\nStory continues\n\nDid OpenAI use YouTube videos?\n\nGoogle employees became aware OpenAI was taking YouTube content to train its models, which would infringe both its own terms of service and possibly the copyright protections of the creators to whom the videos belong. Caught in this bind Google decided not to denounce OpenAI publicly, because it was afraid of drawing attention to its own use of YouTube videos to train AI models, the Times reported.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Fortune the company had “seen unconfirmed reports” that OpenAI had used YouTube videos. They added that YouTube’s terms of service “prohibit unauthorized scraping or downloading” of videos, which the company has a “long history of employing technical and legal measures to prevent.”\n\nMarcus says the behavior of these big tech firms was predictable because data was the key ingredient needed to build the AI tools these companies were in an arms race to develop. Without quality data, like well-written novels, podcasts by knowledgeable hosts, or expertly produced movies, the chatbots and image generators risk spitting out mediocre content. That idea can be summed up in the data science adage “crap in, crap out.” In an op-ed for Fortune Jim Stratton, the chief technology officer of HR software company Workday, said “data is the lifeblood of AI,” making the “need for quality, timely data more important than ever.”\n\nAround 2021, OpenAI ran into a shortage of data. Desperately needing more instances of human speech to continue improving its ChatGPT tool, which was still about a year away from being released, OpenAI decided to get it from YouTube. Employees discussed the fact that cribbing YouTube videos might not be allowed. Eventually a group, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, went ahead with the plan.\n\nThat a senior figure like Brockman was involved in the scheme was evidence of how crucial such data-gathering methods were to developing AI, according to Marcus. Brockman did so “very likely knowing that he was entering a legal gray area—yet desperate to feed the beast,” Marcus wrote. “If it all falls apart, either for legal reasons or technical reasons, that image may linger.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for OpenAI did not answer specific questions about its use of YouTube videos to train its models. “Each of our models has a unique dataset that we curate to help their understanding of the world and remain globally competitive in research,” they wrote in an email. “We use numerous sources including publicly available data and partnerships for nonpublic data, and are exploring synthetic data generation,” they said, referring to the practice of using AI-generated content to train AI models.\n\nOpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati was asked in a Wall Street Journalinterview whether the company’s new Sora video generator had been trained using YouTube videos; she answered, “I’m actually not sure about that.” Last week YouTube CEO Neal Mohan responded by saying that while he didn’t know if OpenAI had actually used YouTube data to train Sora or any other tool, if it had that would violate the platform’s rules. Mohan did mention that Google uses some YouTube content to train its AI tools based on a few contracts it has with individual creators—a statement a Google spokesperson reiterated to Fortune in an email.\n\nMeta decides licensing deal would take too long\n\nOpenAI wasn’t alone in facing a lack of adequate data. Meta was also grappling with the issue. When Meta realized its AI products weren’t as advanced as OpenAI’s, it held numerous meetings with top executives to figure out ways to secure more data to train its systems. Executives considered options like paying a licensing fee of $10 per book for new releases and outright buying the publisher Simon & Schuster. During these meetings executives acknowledged they had already used copyrighted material without the permission of its authors. Ultimately, they decided to press on even if it meant possible lawsuits in the future, according to the New York Times.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta’s lawyers believed if things did end up in litigation they would be covered by a 2015 case Google won against a consortium of authors. At the time a judge ruled that Google was permitted to use the authors’ books without having to pay a licensing fee because it was using their work to build a search engine, which was sufficiently transformative to be considered fair use.\n\nOpenAI is arguing something similar in a case brought against it by the New York Times in December. The Times alleges that OpenAI used its copyrighted material without compensating it for doing so, while OpenAI contends its use of the materials is covered by fair use because they were gathered to train a large language model rather than because it’s a competing news organization.\n\nFor Marcus the hunger for more data was evidence that the whole proposition of AI was built on shaky ground. In order for AI to live up to the hype with which it’s been billed it simply needs more data than is available. “All this happened upon the realization that their systems simply cannot succeed without even more data than the internet-scale data they have already been trained on,” Marcus wrote on Substack.\n\nOpenAI seemed to concede that was the case in written testimony with the U.K.’s House of Lords in December. “It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,” the company wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Google is building its own AI chips—and it’s a warning shot at Nvidia and Intel",
        "content": "Google announced a proprietary chip Tuesday that could help the company cut back its reliance on heavyweight chipmakers and gain a foothold in the increasingly competitive AI race.\n\nThe new chip, dubbed Axion, will help handle the massive amount of data used by AI applications, Google said in a Tuesday statement. It’s designed to be grouped into clusters of thousands of chips to improve performance, the Wall Street Journalreported.\n\nThe new chips—which are central processing units, or CPUs—are reportedly 30% better than already available “general-purpose” chips that use similar circuitry made by the U.K.-based semiconductor and software company Arm, the company said in a statement. Although Google had previously made other chips for its different business segments, this is its first meant to support AI in data centers.\n\nCustomers of the Alphabet subsidiary will be able to access Axion through Google’s cloud business later this year, but will not be able to buy them directly, according to the Journal. The company’s vice president overseeing proprietary chips, Amin Vahdat, told the outlet that it wants to take a different approach.\n\n“Becoming a great hardware company is very different from becoming a great cloud company or a great organizer of the world’s information,” Vahdat said.\n\nBy not selling directly to customers, Google is avoiding direct competition with its longtime partners—and dominant chipmakers—Intel and Nvidia. Instead, Vahdat said, the company sees its entry into the chip market as a positive for everyone in the industry.\n\n“I see this as a basis for growing the size of the pie,” Vahdat said.\n\nAs the hypercompetitive race to enable AI heats up, Google’s rivals likely don’t share that vision. On Tuesday, Santa Clara, Calif.–based semiconductor company Intel released the artificial-intelligence-focused chip Gaudi 3. Intel says the new chips will be available by the third quarter, and can be used to train large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The company claims the Gaudi 3 chips have an edge over Nvidia’s competing chip, the H100.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, announced the new generation of its popular H100 chip in November and plans to release it later this year. Still, shares of Nvidia closed down 2% on Tuesday following the news. The company has seen its stock skyrocket about 75% since the start of the year on outsize demand for its powerful H100 chips, but is facing increasing competition.\n\nShares of Google parent company Alphabet jumped as much as 2.4% on the day following news of the new chip before paring back gains. The stock closed up 1.28% at about $158.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "On Tuesday, Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY) and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud announced a collaboration to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to support radiologists.\n\nAs part of the collaboration, Bayer will further develop its platform to accelerate the development and deployment of AI-powered healthcare applications with a clear focus on radiology, using Google Cloud’s technology, including its generative AI (gen AI) tools.\n\nThe collaboration aims to help organizations overcome many challenges to building scalable and compliant AI-powered medical imaging software products using leading data security capabilities and accelerate the development of impactful solutions.\n\nMedical imaging data accounts for about 90% of all healthcare data. It is a highly complex and rich clinical data modality and a critical tool for diagnosing patients.\n\nBillions of medical images get scanned globally each year, and this number continues to grow, increasing the workload for radiologists and other healthcare professionals tasked with handling and interpreting these images for clinicians and patients.\n\nThe platform’s generative AI flags anomalies within images for radiologists to look at, and it can also pull up relevant information from that patient’s medical history, Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, told CNBC.\n\nSuppose a patient comes in for an annual breast cancer screening, for example. In that case, the platform can detect current problems, compare the image to prior screenings, and summarize that information, he said.\n\nThe goal is to give radiologists the necessary information and save them from spending 15 or 20 minutes searching through patient records, Kurian said.\n\nHealthcare and life science companies will be able to deploy gen AI medical solutions standardized for flexible integration across compatible healthcare systems and analyze field data for insights, bias detection, and continuous improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe platform is built on Google Cloud and uses tools like Vertex AI, BigQuery, Healthcare API, and Chronicle.\n\nThe first version of the Bayer’s platform for extended testing will be available later this year in the EU and U.S.\n\nPhoto by Pixels Hunter on Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google Partners With European Conglomerate Bayer For New AI-Powered Solutions For Radiologists originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Google Shows AI Model Is Enterprise-Ready After Gemini Mishaps",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Google unveiled a host of updates to its artificial intelligence offerings for cloud computing customers, emphasizing that the technology is safe and ready for use in the corporate realm, despite recent stumbles in consumer-facing tools.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrumpism Is Emptying Churches Iran’s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Ukraine Says It’s Behind Blaze on Russian Warship in Baltic Sea Billionaire Geiger, Blackstone Near L’Occitane Deal Yellen Junks 200 Years of Economics to Block China Clean Tech\n\nAt the company’s annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian showed off how Google’s most powerful AI model, Gemini, can be used to create advertisements, ward off cybersecurity threats and spin up short videos and podcasts. The company also touted a new chip designed to handle the massive AI workloads and control the associated rising costs.\n\nCorporate customers will be able to peg Gemini’s query responses to reliable sources of information, known as grounding. The company is rolling out the use of Google search results as a source for the AI model’s answers, thereby providing greater accuracy and freshness, Kurian said.\n\n“Enterprises have been piloting with us a number of scenarios with generative AI; now they’re deploying them in production,” Kurian said in an interview with Bloomberg ahead of the announcements. “The capabilities to do things like grounding, improving correctness of answers — all of those, step by step, people have gotten comfortable, they’re seeing value, and they’re deploying as a result.”\n\nGoogle, a unit of Alphabet Inc., trails Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in cloud computing, but the market is one of the tech giant’s best bets for growth as its core search advertising business matures. Google reported the first full year of profitability at its cloud unit in 2023 and hopes to use its prowess in AI to close the gap with rivals. After OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022 and was quickly embraced by the general public, Google and its cloud competitors see 2024 as the year the technology conquers the corporate world.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of the battle for AI superiority relies on having powerful semiconductors that are able to handle all the data being processed. Google is following Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft in designing its own microprocessors using technology from UK-based chip designer Arm Holdings Plc. The company announced Tuesday that it would roll out a new central processing unit, called Axion, that’s built with data centers in mind. Google said the chip will perform better and be more energy efficient than existing models. Kurian called the technology \"a major new advance.\"\n\nGoogle has been developing its own custom silicon since 2015. But Axion represents Google’s aim to control its own destiny in semiconductors and reduce dependence on third-party vendors. The move further narrows the opportunity for its traditional chip providers — Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — and adds to Arm’s foothold in the lucrative data center market. Google also announced that it would deepen its partnership with Nvidia Corp., which has established a commanding lead in AI chips.\n\nGoogle’s chief rival in artificial intelligence, the Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI, is also courting corporate customers. OpenAI now has more than 600,000 people signed up to use ChatGPT Enterprise, up from around 150,000 in January, Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap said last week.\n\nGoogle’s enterprise push follows some embarrassing setbacks in the consumer market. In February, its flagship artificial intelligence product Gemini, which ingests enormous volumes of digital media to train software that predicts and generates content in response to a prompt or query, was roundly criticized after it spit out historically inaccurate images. CEO Sundar Pichai blasted the responses as “completely unacceptable,” and the Mountain View, California-based company stopped accepting prompts for people in its image generator while it works to address the concerns.\n\nYet Kurian presented generative AI in the enterprise space as a very different story. Businesses can use Gemini to create images for advertising campaigns, but the pro tool comes with 19 different controls to help marketers ensure that the content is in keeping with their brand, Kurian said.\n\nDespite the fallout over the Gemini images, Google Cloud has continued to allow corporate customers to generate images of people using the enterprise version of the tool — and no customers have complained about the results, Kurian said.\n\n“We had zero, zero issues with the reported issues that people had on the consumer side with Gemini for Workspace,” he said. “There was not a single customer affected by it because we have capability in our enterprise platform for the company to control various elements of factuality, safety, model safety, responsibility.”\n\nThose controls will now be augmented by the ability for corporate clients to ground Gemini’s responses in Google search. When this feature is enabled, the AI model will produce citations for every sentence of its outputs, based on its retrieval of information from Google search results. In a demonstration with Bloomberg on Friday, hours after an earthquake struck New Jersey, a Google employee showed how the default version of the model stated that there had been no recent earthquakes in the area; the version of the model grounded in Google search results correctly gave the magnitude of the temblor and said there had been no major reports of damage.\n\nCorporate clients can also ground the model’s responses in their company’s data, or even a specific portion of an employee manual — in contrast to the consumer version of Gemini, which is more a one-size-fits-all tool.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s app developer platform, called Vertex AI, is adding new features underpinned by Gemini 1.5 Pro, which Google has said has the “longest context window” of any large-scale AI model. Gemini 1.5 Pro can process up to 1 million “tokens” — essentially, words or pieces of words — at a time, according to the company, including audio. That means developers can ask the AI model for responses based on hundreds, or potentially thousands, of images, videos, documents and audio files.\n\nIn a demonstration for Bloomberg, a Google Vertex AI product leader showed how Gemini 1.5 Pro works with Google Workspace. Cloud customers can upload marketing images and other media to Google Drive and ask the AI model to create new content such as a slideshow or a podcast based on a brand’s style. Users can also ask the AI model for “live images,” a four-second moving image showing a particular product within a scene. For example, Nenshad Bardoliwalla, the Vertex AI product leader, generated an image of a yellow camping tent against the backdrop of a gently babbling brook. Google said the images generated by its Vertex AI platform would include digital watermarks to signal they were generated by AI.\n\nWhile last year Google touted how its AI tools could be used to complete everyday corporate tasks such as composing email and marketing copy, this year the company extended their capabilities to include more behind-the-scenes work.\n\nThe company also rolled out a series of Gemini applications for cybersecurity, which Google says will help clients analyze threats and address potential vulnerabilities. The features build on Google’s $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant in 2022. Google’s AI-powered security features can help companies be more proactive about combating bad actors, said Eric Doerr, vice president of cloud security engineering. “What otherwise would be very manual research tasks” can be aided by AI, he said.\n\nGoogle was keen to point out how it works with the burgeoning crop of AI startups, which it sees as a key source of cloud business. Many of the most prominent young AI companies were founded by former Google employees, and they make for desirable clients given the tremendous amount of computing power they require.\n\nGoogle Cloud has seen an increase in business from startups using its platform to build generative AI apps and services, Kurian said. More than 60% of generative AI startups that have raised funding are now paying for Google’s cloud computing services, Kurian said. Of those valued at more than $1 billion — colloquially referred to as “unicorns” — 90% are Google Cloud customers, up from 70% in August, he said. New clients include AssemblyAI, a company building AI models for transcription, and Writer, a startup focused on custom generative AI apps like chatbots.\n\nCompetition for such clients is fierce, and many of the startups use multiple cloud providers. Amazon said more than 5,000 generative AI startups were customers of its AWS platform as of September.\n\nKurian said the product updates flowed from close collaboration between his cloud unit and Google DeepMind, the company’s premiere AI lab, led by Demis Hassabis. The lab was the product of the merger of two research groups last year, a move Google made to bring its full talent to bear in the intensifying AI race. Engineers from the cloud and research organizations work closely together — in some cases sitting side by side — to sharpen product focus, Kurian said.\n\n“That collaboration is up and down the organization,” Kurian said. “We’ve got a super close working relationship in the Bay Area, in London, in Seattle with the DeepMind team.”\n\n—With assistance from Ian King.\n\n(Updates to add new efforts around AI chip Axion.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Alphabet (GOOGL) closed at $154.85, marking a +1.54% move from the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.04%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.03%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.03%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the internet search leader had gained 12.62% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Alphabet will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Alphabet to post earnings of $1.49 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $65.95 billion, up 13.57% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.77 per share and revenue of $290.4 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.72% and +13.21%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower within the past month. Alphabet is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at valuation, Alphabet is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.51. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.51, so one might conclude that Alphabet is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.41. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Internet - Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.82 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, putting it in the top 23% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.49, signifying a 27.35% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.57% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.77 per share and revenue of $286.48 billion, which would represent changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

        "title": "George Soros’ Favorite Picks: 3 Stocks the Billionaire Keeps Buying",
        "content": "George Soros’ hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund’s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price.\n\nWhat follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC.\n\niShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) An investor's analyzing the russell 2000 etf fund on a screen. A phone shows the prices of Russell 2000. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.\n\nWhile the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of “small-cap.” The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market’s top performers over the past year, it’s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAerCap Holdings (AER) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn’t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months.\n\nThe Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street’s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view.\n\nSoros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far.\n\nWall Street’s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, “Given the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant’s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97.\n\nAlphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundationsold off their respective stakes.\n\nIt’s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet’s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars.\n\nAlso, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has undoubtedly helped many of its early investors retire as millionaires.\n\nThe stock IPO'd at $85 in 2004, opened at $100, and closed its first day of trading at $100.34, so an ordinary investor could have easily bought the stock around $100 a share at the time of its debut. The company would later enact two stock splits, a nearly 2-to-1 split in March 2014 and a 20-to-1 split in July 2022. So if you bought what was then Google stock at $100 the first day it traded, you would have a split-adjusted cost basis of around $2.50 and a $20,000 investment would be worth close to $1.2 million today.\n\nAlphabet may not generate the same eye-popping returns it did in its first 20 years as a public company, but it still can be a core holding that can help you retire a millionaire.\n\nNot just a search giant\n\nNot surprisingly, Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine. Google has become synonymous with search, leading to an estimated 90% global market share. Google is a cash cow for the company, with the search engine generating $175 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of nearly 8% from 2022.\n\nThe solid revenue increase came despite 2023 being a relatively slow year for advertising growth as many advertisers were cautious with their ad budgets given uncertainties over the economy. However, search revenue often tends to be less economically sensitive compared to other types of advertising. The reason is that this type of advertising is performance-based and thus has a more measurable impact on sales.\n\nHowever, search isn't Alphabet's fastest-growing segment -- that title belongs to its cloud business, which grew its 2023 revenue by 26% to $33.1 billion. Google Cloud is a business with a lot of fixed costs in terms of data centers and engineering, so scale matters. The segment just turned profitable in 2023, but it is now set to grow its profitability at a quicker pace than revenue given the operating leverage in the business.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet's other big business is YouTube, which generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up 8%. Like Google, it also gets much of its revenue from advertising. However, the company's YouTube Premium and Music services just surpassed 100 million subscribers. Both services offer ad-free content and contributed about $15 billion of YouTube's revenue.\n\nOne of the strengths of the YouTube video platform is that it does not have the upfront content costs of other video services, instead opting for a revenue-sharing model with content creators. This has helped the company avoid many of the profitability issues that have plagued other streaming services. The company is also looking to compete with TikTok through YouTube Short videos by incentivizing creators to use the platform. Monetization of YouTube Shorts is still early, but represents a large potential opportunity given the platform's over 2 billion monthly users.\n\nAI opportunity and an inexpensive stock\n\nGiven its dominant position in search and strong cloud and YouTube businesses, Alphabet is trading at an inexpensive valuation despite trading near an all-time high. It trades at a forward P/E of about 22.5 times and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of just 12.5 times. The latter metric takes into consideration the company's large net cash position of $97.7 billion and removes any non-cash items. This alone makes the stock a buy. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, the big reason to own Alphabet over the long term, and why it could help you retire a millionaire, is its underrated position in artificial intelligence (AI). The company is currently seeing the most beneficial impact from AI in its cloud service business, where it has credited AI for helping it win and expand deals last quarter.\n\nHowever, there is some fear among investors that AI could disrupt Google's search dominance. So far there has been little indication of this happening. Traditional linked-based search results will likely continue to be the best way to serve users actively looking to buy a product or service. This represents only about 20% of searches done on Google, and it's the only time the company serves up ads. AI, meanwhile, could help the company profit from the 80% of searches for which it does not provide ads. For example, AI could provide Alphabet the opportunity to profit from questions answered using AI, either through brand advertising or a subscription service.\n\nThe landscape is evolving with AI, but companies will undoubtedly find new ways to profit from its uses and capabilities. Twenty years ago Google was only a search engine that IPO'd with a $23 billion market cap. Today, the company owns two non-search businesses that generate over $30 billion a year in revenue in Google Cloud Services and YouTube, along with its powerful search business. While it's difficult to predict where a stock will be in the next 20 years, Alphabet should be viewed as a core holding that can help power your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tesla (TSLA) to Unveil Its Much-Awaited Robotaxi on Aug 8",
        "content": "Tesla, Inc. TSLA is poised to reveal its robotaxi on Aug 8, 2024, per Elon Musk’s post on X. The robotaxi reportedly utilizes TSLA’s latest vehicle platform.\r\n\r\nDuring a 2023 event revealing the company’s third Master Plan, Musk hinted at the potential of a Tesla robotaxi, even showcasing a fully concealed vehicle. A few years ago, Musk conjectured that Tesla owners could generate income by sending their autonomous cars for pickups and drop-offs.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Musk’s predictions regarding the actual availability of self-driving vehicles remain overdue.\r\n\r\nIn April 2019, Tesla planned to start operating its robotaxis by 2020. The car was expected to last for 11 years and drive one million miles, helping the company and car operators earn a profit of $30,000 each year. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, Elon Musk told Tesla’s shareholders that the cars manufactured by the company will become fully autonomous within three years. In 2016, he suggested that by the end of the following year, sending one of its vehicles on a cross-country drive would not require any human intervention.\r\n\r\nTesla is yet to deliver a technology that can transform its cars into level 3 automated vehicles. The automaker offers advanced driver assistance systems, comprising a standard Autopilot option or a premium Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) option. Notably, the FSD subscription is priced at $199 per month for U.S. customers or alternatively available at a one-time upfront payment of $12,000.\r\n\r\nMusk admitted that his track record for predictions can sometimes be significantly off the mark but he eventually gets things done.\r\n\r\nIn a drive to boost end-of-quarter sales, Musk recently made it necessary for sales and service personnel to install and demonstrate FSD for customers prior to handing over the keys.\r\n\r\nTesla’s premium option still requires drivers to stay attentive all the time and take control of the steering and brake whenever required.\r\n\r\nTSLA’s reveal date for a model should not be confused with the date of its commercial release. For example, the EV pioneer unveiled Semi in 2017 but did not commence the deliveries until December 2022.\r\n\r\nThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nBesides Tesla, Alphabet’s GOOG autonomous vehicle unit Waymo and General Motors’ GM subsidiary, Cruise, are working on self-driving ride-sharing services.\r\n\r\nWaymo currently operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles and is ramping up production in Austin, TX. It has signed a multi-year partnership with Uber and will provide its robotaxi to the food delivering company to deliver food in Arizona.\r\n\r\nGM Cruise has halted its testing work on its self-driving car following an accident. The company is currently under regulatory scrutiny. While General Motors remains committed to Cruise, it aims to reduce the expenses of its self-driving arm by about $1 billion in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "YouTube TV challenged cable by doing one simple thing — imitating it",
        "content": "More viewers are cutting the cord in favor of less expensive streaming packages. But Alphabet-owned YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) has seen success by mimicking the one thing consumers seem to be ditching.\n\nYouTube TV, the internet pay-TV service that allows viewers to watch live channels and access local broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC, first launched in 2017. Since then, its breadth of content as well as its price of just over $70 per month has made it attractive to consumers looking for a cheaper replacement for their cable packages.\n\n\"We hear from our users that they want to be able to watch all their favorite content in one place, and they want to be able to manage all of their subscriptions in one place,\" Christian Oestlien, vice president of product management at YouTube, told Yahoo Finance. \"There's a bit of this subscription fatigue.\"\n\nAccording to Nielsen's latest TV viewing report, YouTube, which also includes the main digital platform, notched its 13th consecutive month as the most-watched streaming service on television screens during the month of February.\n\nIn total, YouTube jumped to a platform-best 9.3% of total US TV viewing, up from the prior-year period's 7.9%. It also delivered a sizable beat compared to Netflix's 7.8% market share.\n\nBroadcast and cable continued to see yearly declines, contributing to a combined 50.9% of overall TV viewing — down from 54% in February 2023.\n\nIt's a significant feat for YouTube considering the fragmented media landscape.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Additionally, 68% of consumers surveyed pay for either a TV subscription or live streaming TV plan to access channels not available on streaming.\n\nYouTube TV has capitalized on that demand.\n\nThe platform is now the largest pay-TV streamer on the market after recently surpassing 8 million subscribers at a price point of $72.99 a month. Disney's Hulu + Live TV (DIS), which costs $76.99 a month, is the next closest competitor with 4.6 million subscribers as of the quarter ending Dec. 30.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We have the ability to deliver that complete experience,\" Oestlien said, referencing the success of not only YouTube TV, but also the popularity of the platform's digital arm with features like YouTube Shorts, a competitor to Instagram Reels and TikTok, along with viral content creators like Mr. Beast. \"I think it's resonated with consumers.\" YouTube TV first launched in 2017 and has since contributed to YouTube's rise to the top of the Nielsen ratings charts. (Dado Ruvic/REUTERS/Illustration/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nFor Alphabet, YouTube has become an increasingly important segment of the company with revenue from its annual subscription services, which includes YouTube TV, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music, and Google One cloud storage, amounting to $15 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's Q4 earnings call in January.\n\nMoffettNathanson emphasized YouTube's importance in a note published on March 28, arguing it's the tech giant's second-most-important business to date — just behind its generative artificial intelligence efforts.\n\n\"With the growing success of their two leading subscription services (YouTube TV and YouTube Music), YouTube’s revenue growth accelerated by an estimated 17% in 2023 — almost double the 2022 growth rate,\" analyst Michael Nathanson wrote. \"If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $375 to $400 billion.\"\n\nMoffettNathanson expects YouTube to generate 16% margins by 2026 with operating profits expected to double to $11 billion. To compare, Netflix reported full-year 2023 operating margins of 21%.\n\n'Sports underpins the entire experience'\n\nSports has served as the anchor to YouTube TV's success, especially after it secured the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket in late 2022.\n\n\"For YouTube TV, sports underpins the entire experience,\" Oestlien said. \"Sports has always been a really critical component of what I think makes YouTube TV special.\"\n\nSunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide, is currently available as an add-on package on YouTube TV or as a standalone à la carte service on YouTube Primetime Channels.\n\nOestlien categorized the Sunday Ticket launch as a \"great moment\" for the company, adding the package has served as a key driver for increased word-of-mouth subscriptions as more consumers cut the cable cord: \"It was something that really captured people's attention.\"\n\nBut YouTube will face more competition in sports going forward.\n\nMost recently, Disney's ESPN (DIS) announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Fox (FOXA) to launch a new sports streaming service sometime this fall.\n\nThe unnamed platform, which is expected to be priced \"in the higher ranges\" of current $40 to $50 a month estimates, will bring together the three companies' respective slates of sports networks and target YouTube TV's core demographic of \"cord cutters\" and \"cord nevers.\"\n\nESPN will also debut a separate fully over-the-top sports streaming service in 2025.\n\nOestlien shrugged off the increased competition. Rather, he said the upcoming launches could open up more partnership opportunities for YouTube TV.\n\n\"A lot of the platforms that you would think would be competitors of ours are actually some of our closest partners,\" he said. \"The three companies that are partnered in this new streaming service are all really good partners of ours that we interact with on a daily basis. I'm personally really excited to see them leaning into offering more consumer choice.\"\n\nStill, the competition is only expected to grow with upcoming sports rights renewals on the horizon for prominent leagues like the NBA.\n\nExperts say tech giants like YouTube have the upper hand in negotiations over traditional players, which have seen linear revenue plummet amid the cord-cutting phenomenon.\n\n\"YouTube and these other Big Tech companies are sitting on a lot of cash,\" said Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at Qvest, a media and entertainment-focused consulting company. \"They have the ability to pounce on these things and have so much more flexibility because they're not burdened by a ton of debt. They also have the hardware and the infrastructure to support all of this [live streaming programming.]\"\n\nOestlien wouldn't give specifics on YouTube's current negotiations. But he did emphasize the opportunity within the growing sports streaming marketplace.\n\n\"It's going to be a really fluid market for the next several years and that's only going to benefit consumers,\" he said of upcoming media rights renewals. \"Hopefully, YouTube can play a big part there.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital wallet market on the back of new Google Wallet features. Per The Business Research Company report, the digital wallet market is expected to hit $47.7 billion in 2024 and reach $97.54 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 19.6% between 2024 and 2033.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company recently unveiled a new “Automatically add linked passes” feature to Google Wallet.\r\n\r\nThis new feature is an addition to the \"Passes\" sub-section in Google Wallet settings on Android. It allows providers to automatically add event tickets, promotions and offers to existing passes.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Auto Linked Passes feature also allows providers to send additional passes to users with existing passes in their Google Wallet and pre-link passes to primary passes.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle Wallet in Focus\n\nApart from the Auto Linked Passes feature, Google recently added a new “Verification settings” feature in Google Wallet for Android, enabling users to choose whether to verify their identity when using payment methods and passes.\r\n\r\nThis new feature leads to a \"Transit payments\" option that enables user identity verification before paying with a credit or debit card.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also announced Google Wallet updates to support open-loop payment systems, providing a dedicated page for recent activity and ride history, showing saved fare caps, connected payment methods and network-specific offerings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company announced an update to its Wallet app for Wear OS, enabling users to access their loyalty cards.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the latest update, Google Wallet on Wear OS now supports all loyalty cards stored on phones or Google Accounts, appearing after payment methods. The users can tap on a QR or barcode to view details, scroll down for more information and use shortcuts like “Open on phone” or “Delete pass” on their smartwatches.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have gained 43.3% in the past year, compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 43.1%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $290.4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nGrowing Google Wallet efforts will aid Alphabet to compete well with the likes of Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making strong efforts to boost their presence in the booming digital wallet space.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s addition of a cryptocurrency wallet to its Edge Wallet remains noteworthy. This feature provides real-time updates on cryptocurrency value fluctuations and logging transactions for effective monitoring.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Microsoft Wallet app securely saves card numbers with expiry dates and CVV codes, ensuring the protection of payment information for shopping or payment gateways.\r\n\r\nApple, on the other hand, is enjoying the growing momentum of Apple Wallet with the addition of new features.\r\n\r\nNotably, Apple Pay orders can now be attached to receipts as PDF or image files, allowing customers to track payment in the Wallet app and to confirmation emails.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is AMETEK AME, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of AMETEK have increased 3% in the past year.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Are Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) bull market is here.\n\nFollowing the launch of ChatGPT, the power of generative AI technology has become clear, and tech companies are racing to take advantage of it, both to find better ways to serve their customers and to make their operations more efficient.\n\nInvestors have also caught on to this trend, and investor enthusiasm is a big reason why tech stocks have soared since the beginning of 2023, with the \"Magnificent Seven\" leading the way.\n\nLet's take a look at a few of the companies leading the AI race. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's impossible to talk about generative AI without mentioning Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been at the center of the AI revolution, as they're the most valued piece of infrastructure in running AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia prepared for this moment years ago, building out its capabilities in AI and partnering with companies like OpenAI, and it's paid off. The company has an estimated 98% market share of the data center GPU market, and its technological leadership and soaring demand for its components have led to a shortage and given it tremendous pricing power.\n\nNvidia's recent results speak for themselves, and explain why the stock has jumped more than 400% since the beginning of 2023, making it the third-most-valuable company in the world behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, driven by 409% growth in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 769% to $12.3 billion, giving it a profit margin above 50%.\n\nNvidia's growth rate will slow down, but the company has a solid lead in AI technology, which should mean it remains a winner.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhile Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, Microsoft has established itself as the leader in AI software.\n\nBecause of its partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion, and its diversification across multiple tech platforms, Microsoft has the ability to deploy AI capabilities across multiple product lines, and that's what it's doing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the help of OpenAI, Microsoft has added AI technology to products like Azure cloud computing, GitHub code repository, Microsoft Office, and Bing search engine, and it's deployed its AI Copilot chatbot across those products and others.\n\nThose efforts are having an impact on the business already. For example, management said in its most recent quarter that six points of Azure's 30% revenue growth came from AI.\n\nMicrosoft also has no intention of taking its foot off the gas. The company recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, who is considered one of the top minds in AI. It also hired several of its employees from Inflection AI after the AI start-up folded.\n\nMicrosoft and CEO Satya Nadella have bet big on AI, and the company will continue to look for new ways to leverage the new technology.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) hasn't gotten as much attention as Nvidia or Microsoft in the AI race, but it deserves to be recognized as one of the leaders.\n\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired the AI lab DeepMind in 2014 and recently merged it with Google Brain. It's also been developing its own AI technologies for roughly a decade.\n\nAlphabet has been less aggressive than Microsoft in AI, but the Google parent quickly responded to the launch of ChatGPT with its own chatbot, Bard. That has evolved into Gemini, which may be the closest challenger to ChatGPT today.\n\nAlphabet's investments in its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary shouldn't be overlooked either. While self-driving cars have largely been a disappointment thus far, Waymo appears to be the leader in the emerging technology, and its driverless vehicles are now on the road, ferrying passengers in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.\n\nThe company also uses AI to improve search results on both Google Search and YouTube and to offer increased functionality in Google Cloud.\n\nMuch like its rival Microsoft, you can expect Alphabet to look for new ways to integrate AI in its products as it's bet big on the booming technology and plans to be a leader.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Google's contemplated mega deal would prompt new fight with regulators",
        "content": "By Milana Vinn and Anirban Sen\n\n(Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet's contemplated acquisition of marketing software company HubSpot would likely spark opposition from regulators even as many experts agree it would not curb competition, and would require the technology giant to open a new front in its battle with antitrust watchdogs.\n\nReuters reported last week that Google was mulling an offer for HubSpot, which has a market value of $34 billion. Google has been weighing the antitrust risks of a potential deal and has yet to decide if it will make an offer.\n\nNearly a dozen antitrust experts and industry analysts said in interviews and analyst notes that it was unlikely that an acquisition by Google would hamper competition.\n\nThey said this is because the so-called customer relationship management (CRM) software sector in which HubSpot operates is already served by several major players, including Salesforce, Adobe, Microsoft and Oracle. Google does not compete in CRM, and the acquisition could make HubSpot a more formidable player thanks to Google's cloud-computing resources, improving offerings and prices for customers, they added.\n\nAccording to technology researcher Gartner, HubSpot, which focuses on smaller customers, had a 4.9% market share in 2022 in the CRM marketing software industry, while Salesforce and Adobe each held a 15% share.\n\nYet these experts also said it is very likely that a Google deal for HubSpot would trigger challenges from U.S. and European antitrust regulators, given their growing aversion to technology giants getting bigger through acquisitions.\n\nThey added that Google would have to be willing to argue for the merits of the deal in a long court battle, and would need to convince HubSpot to do the same.\n\n\"My initial reaction is such a deal would face a pretty tough reception from the antitrust regulators,\" said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the U.S. Senate antitrust subcommittee who now runs his own advisory firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle and HubSpot did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGoogle already faces several antitrust challenges, including two lawsuits from the United States Department of Justice. One accuses it of abusing its position as online search leader, while the other alleges it is monopolizing the market for digital advertising.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe regulatory terrain for Google is also hostile in Europe. It is among technology firms probed by the European Union for potential breaches of the new Digital Markets Act, a directive that makes it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores.\n\n\"This transaction has not been formally notified to the Commission. If a transaction constitutes a concentration and has an EU dimension, it is always up to the companies to notify it to the Commission,\" said a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which has fined Google in the past for anticompetitive practices in online search.\n\nCASH PILE\n\nThe intensity of the antitrust scrutiny has dissuaded most technology giants from pursuing mega deals. The last major acquisition completed was Microsoft's $69 billion deal to buy \"Call of Duty\" maker Activision Blizzard, which the maker of the Xbox console managed to get past Britain's regulators only after it agreed to give up streaming rights for Activision's games.\n\nIn December, Adobe shelved its $20 billion deal for cloud-based designer platform Figma, citing \"no clear path\" for antitrust approvals in Europe and Britain. The regulators fretted about the ability of Figma's smaller rivals to compete.\n\nPrior to its HubSpot deliberations, Google had steered clear of large acquisitions. Its biggest-ever deal, the purchase of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, came more than a decade ago. It has kept its dealmaking small, showing an affinity toward acquisitions in advertising with purchases such as DoubleClick and AdMob.\n\nWhat has pushed Google toward a big deal is its swelling cash pile of $110 billion and the need to better deploy capital to generate returns. While it is investing heavily in artificial intelligence like its peers, its shareholder returns have lagged those of other players in this space such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms over the last few months.\n\nWilliam Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School, said Google's dominance in online search tainted it in the eyes of regulators even in areas where the company does not compete, such as CRM software.\n\n\"If you slam the door shut on mergers that could permit a nonparticipant or a weaker participant to get a bigger foothold in the market, you've withdrawn an important potential source of rivalry in the market,\" Kovacic said.\n\n(Reporting by Milana Vinn and Anirban Sen in New YorkEditing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew Lewis)",

(Reuters / Reuters)\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nSpot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows are anticipated to remain robust leading up to the Bitcoin halving, according to analysts.\n\nBitcoin halving means the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created and therefore lower the available amount of new supply. Bitcoin last halved on 11 May 2020, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 BTC. The next halving expected around 20 April will bring the block reward down to 3.125 BTC.\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment said that Bitcoin ETF volume has not slowed down since the asset’s mid-March all-time high.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as UK shop insolvencies hit five-year high\n\n“It is a likely foregone conclusion that high activity should continue leading up to the April halving, but it will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterwards.”\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nShares in Elon Musk’s EV maker were almost 4% higher in premarket trading as the company drops prices in an attempt to clear out its biggest ever inventory stockpile.\n\nTesla is cutting rear-wheel-drive Model Y prices by $4,600 (£3,643). The Model Y Long Range and Model Y Performance will see $5,000 price cuts, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTesla is offering the deals after producing 46,561 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter, adding more cars to inventory than ever before.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nLast quarter, Tesla posted its first annual sales decline since the pandemic — a drop that was significantly worse than expected. The company blamed a weak Chinese economy, arson at its German factory and supply constraints because of escalating conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe stock has dropped 31% this year, the second-worst showing on the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is setting up an artificial intelligence lab in London, in the latest boost to the city as an AI hub.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company said Microsoft AI London would help drive its work in advance “state-of-the-art language models” and in creating “world-class tooling for foundation models.”\n\nBased in the firm’s Paddington offices, the new AI hub will work on consumer AI projects and will be led by Jordan Hoffman, a former scientist at Google’s (GOOG) DeepMind lab.\n\nRead more: Rental costs set to outpace wage growth in UK\n\nCompanies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent.\n\nMicrosoft said it would be “actively hiring” employees to work on the most “challenging AI questions of our time” in the coming weeks and months, although did not say how many jobs would be created.\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nBoeing shares slipped in premarket trading as the company is yet again under the spotlight for safety concerns after an engine cover fell off during take-off in Denver, US.\n\nUS airline regulators have launched an investigation after the part came off and struck the wing flap. Flight 3695 — with 135 passengers and six crew members aboard — rose to about 10,300ft (3,140 metres) before returning safely 25 minutes later to Denver.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) said its maintenance teams would review the Boeing 737-800 after its cowling, which covers the plane's engine, fell off. The airline confirmed it was responsible for maintenance of such parts.\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,\" a statement said.\n\nBoeing is overhauling its leadership amid its most significant safety crisis in years, announcing sweeping changes that included the departure of its chief executive Dave Calhoun at the end of the year.\n\nWatch: Ether-bitcoin ratio to flash death cross: What does it mean for altcoins?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Adds details of proposal, background, no immediate tech company comments, paragraphs 4-5, 7-10)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - Two key U.S. lawmakers said on Sunday they struck a deal on draft bipartisan data privacy legislation that would restrict consumer data that technology companies can collect and give Americans the power to prevent selling of personal information or compel its deletion.\n\nThe agreement between Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, would give individuals control over use of their personal information and require disclosure if data has been transferred to foreign adversaries.\n\nCongress has been debating online privacy protections since at least 2019 amid concerns about use of data by social media companies including Meta Platforms' Facebook, Alphabet's Google and ByteDance-owned TikTok, but have been unable to reach agreement.\n\nAides told reporters on Sunday they hoped to advance legislation soon. Meta, TikTok and Google could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn a joint statement, the lawmakers said the plan gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general broad authority to oversee consumer privacy issues and establish \"robust enforcement mechanisms to hold violators accountable, including a private right of action for individuals.\"\n\nThe bill does not ban targeted advertising but gives consumers the ability to opt out of it. The FTC would create a new bureau focused on privacy and could issue fines for privacy violations which would also cover telecommunications companies.\n\nIn 2019, Facebook agreed to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve an FTC probe into its privacy practices, triggered by allegations Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree. The FTC now wants to tighten that existing privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial-recognition technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, ByteDance agreed to a $92 million class-action settlement regarding data privacy claims from some U.S. TikTok users. Reuters reported last month that the FTC could soon resolve its investigation into TikTok over allegedly faulty privacy and data security practices.\n\nGoogle and its YouTube unit in 2019 paid $170 million in a settlement with the FTC and New York to resolve allegations it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children.\n\nU.S. lawmakers Cantwell and Rodgers added: \"This bipartisan, bicameral draft legislation is the best opportunity we’ve had in decades to establish a national data privacy and security standard that gives people the right to control their personal information.\"\n\nThe measure would allow people to opt out of data processing if a company changes its privacy policy. It requires \"affirmative express consent before sensitive data can be transferred to a third party.\"\n\nConsumers could sue \"bad actors who violate their privacy rights - and recover money for damages when they’ve been harmed\" and would stop \"companies from using people’s personal information to discriminate against them,\" the statement said.\n\nThe bill would require \"annual reviews of algorithms to ensure they do not put individuals, including our youth, at risk of harm, including discrimination.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Bill Berkrot and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Meet the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Over the Last Month (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven large, tech-focused companies. Due to a combination of their size, underlying fundamentals, and growth, these companies led the market rally in 2023. They have also contributed the bulk of the S&P 500's gains in 2024.\n\nHowever, something has changed over the last month. One of the three Magnificent Seven stocks that had been down year to date is suddenly up -- a lot -- over the last month.\n\nHere's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has suddenly become the hottest Magnificent Seven stock and why it remains a great value even though it is hovering around a 52-week high. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn and out of favor\n\nIt has been a wild ride for Alphabet stock in 2024. In late January, it was around the same price it is today -- above $150 a share. But in early March, it fell to the low $130 per-share range due to investor pessimism regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- specifically, Google Gemini AI and its inaccuracies.\n\nBut then, in mid-March, news surfaced that Alphabet was in talks with Apple to license Gemini AI in iPhones, putting a much-needed stamp of approval on Alphabet's AI endeavors. The stock rose as much as 7.7% on March 18, which contributed to its over 12% gain in the past month. GOOGL Chart\n\nPartnering with Apple would be a huge deal for Alphabet. Despite owning various differentiated businesses, like Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android, Alphabet still depends on ads for the vast majority of its revenue. The more it can diversify its business away from ads, the wider its moat and the more levers it can pull to unlock growth.\n\nAt least in the short term, Alphabet stock has moved in and out of favor with Wall Street based on its perceived AI aptitude and potential. In reality, this is a company that has been monetizing AI for some time and has a massive research and development budget and cash to invest in innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's a target on Alphabet's back\n\nWith so many growth narratives flooding the market, it can be easy to get caught up in implied-growth trajectories and overlook the companies that have already accomplished so much and are earning a ton of profit. In other words, outweighing the unknown and discounting proven winners.\n\nAlphabet is a proven winner, but there are question marks surrounding how it will stay a winner in the midst of so much competition.\n\nGoogle Search and YouTube rely on complex AI-driven algorithms. But platforms like TikTok and Meta Platforms' Instagram Reels have been cited as alternative search engines to Google by younger generations like Gen Z.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud is third behind Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud-infrastructure market share.\n\nAndroid is still the dominant operating system globally, but iOS is bigger in core areas like the U.S., and Apple has more control over its hardware and software integration than Alphabet.\n\nInvert your thinking\n\nThe glass-half-empty outlook on Alphabet is that it is a market leader across many different industries but that all of its industries are ripe for disruption.\n\nIt has been the leader in search for decades, but can it maintain pole position in the face of mounting competition from short-video platforms or new competition remains to be seen?\n\nConsumers have more entertainment options than ever, so will YouTube lose market share to other streaming sites?\n\nWill Google Cloud be able to take market share against its larger peers?\n\nThese are all valid questions.\n\nWhen you like a company, it's always good to consider the counterargument. Charlie Munger used to talk about the inversion process as a way to expand a line of thinking. Before buying a stock, we usually think about the reasons why the company is a good investment. But inversion would involve thinking about all the reasons why folks would want to sell the stock, why it could go lower, underperform the market, etc.\n\nThere's usually a halfway decent counterargument to even the best stocks. But sometimes, even bad counterarguments can become dominant market sentiment if the market is pessimistic on a stock as it had been on Alphabet relative to the rest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAlphabet is a good value\n\nAlphabet has an established, cash-cow business model and plenty of ways to monetize AI. It is no stranger to competition, as there are always other companies that want a slice of a high-margin industry.\n\nIn Alphabet's favor is its inexpensive valuation. It has a mere 26.7 price-to-earnings ratio, slightly above Apple's 26.3 for the second-lowest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. It also has a 28.8 price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio, also second-lowest behind Apple in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAlphabet may not be the most exciting growth stock out there right now. But what it does have is a profitable business and room to take risks and unlock growth. Alphabet's deep pockets and track record of innovation are reason enough for the stock to not trade at a discount to the S&P 500 (like it does today).\n\nAlphabet stock should have never fallen as much as it did. And even now, it looks like a reasonable long-term buy for patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the darling of Wall Street for a while. The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023, and so far this year, its shares are up around 80%.\n\nBut analysts don't expect this sizzling momentum to continue. The consensus price target for Nvidia is barely above its current share price. Here are three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Wall Street thinks will soar more than Nvidia over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a laggard in 2024. It even lost the spot as the biggest company in the world, based on market cap, to Microsoft. However, analysts are more bullish about Apple than any other Magnificent Seven stock right now.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Apple reflects an upside potential of over 9%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April, 32 rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The others recommend holding the stock.\n\nIt might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26.\n\nAnalysts, though, could be anticipating a catalyst with Apple's June developer conference. The company is widely expected to unveil its generative AI strategy at the event.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't delivered Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns. However, the e-commerce and cloud services leader nonetheless pleased investors with a gain of 80% last year and a 20% jump so far this year.\n\nWall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nGenerative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) jumped 58% in 2023. The stock is up over 10% year to date in 2024. Like Apple and Amazon, Alphabet still has more room to run in Wall Street's view.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nAlphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business.\n\nWhy Wall Street could be right\n\nYou can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too.\n\nNvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds.\n\nWall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Superb Growth Stocks to Buy in Today's Bull Market",
        "content": "Investors have been eager for a new bull market, and when multiple indexes high new all-time highs in early 2024, they got final confirmations that new bull markets were well underway. While not all stocks are fully contributing to the growth of today's bull market at the moment, companies with wide moats and demonstrable financial strength are steadily making their way to the top.\n\nIf you're looking for two superb growth stocks to scoop up in the wake of this current bull market, here are two names you won't want to overlook.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is a veteran player in the tech space, but that doesn't mean its growth opportunity is anywhere close to ending. The company's flagship search engine, Google, accounts for roughly 40% of all digital advertising revenue generated in the entire world. However, the digital advertising market is still growing at an elevated pace and it's on track to reach a global valuation of $1.2 trillion by the year 2030. That means it's expected to generate a compound annual growth rate of approximately 16% from its current valuation.\n\nIn the full year 2023, Alphabet brought in total revenue of about $307 billion while net income came to approximately $74 billion. Those two figures represented increases of 9% and 23%, respectively, from 2022. Digital advertising through Google Search still accounts for the lion's share of the company's revenue. Case in point: Alphabet brought in fourth-quarter revenue of $86 billion, about $48 billion of which came from the Google search engine.\n\nWhile search brings in the majority of revenue, other segments account for more and more of Alphabet's revenue growth. One example is YouTube, which brought in advertising revenue of $9.2 billion in the final three months of 2023, a healthy 16% bump from what it reported in the same quarter in 2022. Subscriptions are also a growing piece of the pie for Alphabet. The company's subscriptions, platform, and devices business brought in revenue just shy of $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 23% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also making its own impressive strides in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Gemini is Alphabet's large language model (LLM) chatbot and it is designed to work in mediums ranging from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini is available in different versions and tiers so organizations of various sizes can choose what works for their unique needs. Alphabet launched the latest iteration of its AI model Gemini 1.5 in February, just a few months after the initial version launched. There is a wide variety of use cases for these models, and Gmail and Google Docs already have Gemini incorporated in some capacity.\n\nAccording to a Financial Times report on April 3, Alphabet may even be contemplating an AI-powered search engine that would feature a subscription-based paywall. The expansive footprint Alphabet has maintained in the search engine market through the decades continues to drive its business forward. The company's focus on widening its subscription-based offerings is a wise move as it seeks to diversify in a competitive space that is rapidly evolving as the AI boom continues. For long-term investors, Alphabet still looks like a no-brainer stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\n2. Pinterest\n\nPinterest(NYSE: PINS) has had a turbulent few years following a significant uptick in growth during the early months of the pandemic. In the difficult macro period that has followed the height of the pandemic, a deceleration in advertising spend -- Pinterest's bread and butter -- has posed challenges.\n\nA combination of unfavorable comparisons in revenue and user growth to the heightened pandemic period, along with a general slowdown in these areas, also dampened investor enthusiasm about the business. And, the challenging economic landscape has caused companies to be more cautious with where they put advertising dollars, a trend that Pinterest can't control but which will recover slowly as macro conditions improve.\n\nPinterest's free-to-use website and mobile app provide millions of users all over the world with inspiration on everything from recipes to travel to home decor, but these platforms are also a prime source of advertising space for brands. The company makes money by selling ad space to merchants across a range of industries and placing those ads in the forms of videos and images among the rest of the \"pins\" that users peruse to look for inspiration on any given topic.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Pinterest had 498 million monthly active users around the globe, a solid increase of 11% compared to the end of 2022. Revenue for the year totaled $3 billion, up 9% from 2022. Globally, average revenue per user (ARPU) rose just 1% in the 12-month period. However, broken down by region, ARPU rose 5% in the U.S. and Canada, 15% in Europe, and 17% in the rest of the world last year.\n\nWhile the company reported a net loss for the year on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), it reported positive net income in both the third and fourth quarters of 2023: $7 million and $201 million, respectively. The company seems to be inching back to a healthy level of growth after a series of bumpy financial reports, and investors have taken notice. Pinterest is trading up about 30% from one year ago at the time of this writing. Now could be a good time to scoop up a few shares of the social media stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "20 Most Democratic Countries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 20 most democratic countries in Asia. You can skip our detailed analysis on global corporations that promote democracy and head over directly to the 5 Most Democratic Countries in Asia.\n\nThe question of whether democracy leads to economic growth continues to remain a talking point as China advances on the world stage after its spectacular rise over the last few decades, coupled with oil-rich monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council exhibiting high levels of economic prosperity. On the other hand, India’s economy also continues to thrive, despite right-wing populism polarizing the country.\n\nHowever, a research in 2016 co-authored by professors at MIT, Harvard, and Columbia found that democratization leads to economic growth. The study examined several countries that transitioned to democracy between 1960 and 2010, and the results showed that these countries experienced a 20% increase in their GDP in the first 25 years following their shift to democracy from nondemocracy.\n\nSeveral large multinational corporations have recently committed themselves to advancing democratic values across the world. Last year, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the White House’s Summit for Democracy pledged support of up to $2 million for human rights defenders, who regularly face online harassment and physical threats over their commitment to uphold freedom of speech. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be allocating these funds to set up safety helplines for vulnerable individuals. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also announced plans to roll out over 100,000 Titan security keys to high-risk users, such as journalists and activists to protect them from online cyber attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) works with researchers on sharing data related to internet closures in different parts of the world. The company is connected to more than 11,000 networks worldwide, and collaborates with organizations such as Access Now and the Internet Society to keep track of internet shutdowns. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) regularly consults members of the civil society as well to make sure that all product developments and technologies enhance privacy and are consistent with protecting human rights.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2020, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) partnered with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to widen its protection systems to ensure free and fair elections outside the United States as well. As part of the agreement, the company has since then provided services to six electoral bodies outside the US, including in Canada, North Macedonia, and Kosovo.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in collaboration with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) trains journalists on digital safety and cybersecurity, with an emphasis on how governments abuse state power to steal elections. The program started in October 2022 in Tunisia, before expanding to Serbia later during the same year. 29 journalists benefited from this joint initiative of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IFES in these two countries. According to the IFES, the training program has received high demand from several other countries as well, and it plans on expanding this to those regions in the near future in partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 20 Most Democratic Countries in Asia\n\nCopyright: yunlutas / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 20 most democratic countries in Asia are ranked based on averaging countries’ rankings on the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)’s Democracy Index 2023 and V-dem Institute’s Democracy Report 2024. Asia’s most democratic countries are listed in ascending order of their average ranking scores.\n\nBefore we get started, it is important to mention that the state of democracy in Asia continues to regress. Only three Asian countries qualified as ‘full democracies’ in the EIU’s latest index, with most others being categorized as flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. There were also countries in the continent that practiced democracy on paper, but were considered authoritarian due to their extreme violations and erosion of democratic freedoms and values.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the Top 15 Democratic Socialist Countries In Europe.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet’s now head over to the list of the most democratic countries in Asia.\n\n20. Turkiye\n\nAverage Ranking: 121\n\nWe begin our list with Turkiye, which is categorized as a hybrid regime by the Economist Intelligence Unit and has been criticized for its lack of civil liberties. Despite that, it remains a vibrant democracy with hope for improvement in the future; a glimpse of which was witnessed in the opposition’s stunning victories in Istanbul and Ankara in this week’s local elections.\n\n19. Pakistan\n\nAverage Ranking: 118.5\n\nPakistan is the fifth largest democracy in the world, but has seen its ranking suffer heavily in the last two years, due an increase in military interference in the running of the country. It was ranked 118th on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index 2023 and took 119th spot on V-Dem’s 2024 Democracy Report.\n\n18. Hong Kong\n\nAverage Ranking: 111\n\nHong Kong has been described as a hybrid regime by The Economist, ranking the special administrative region of China on 88th spot in its Democracy Index. It is ranked 134th in V-Dem’s Democracy Index. Beijing’s tightening grip over Hong Kong over the last few years have dimmed hopes about the region becoming a full democracy.\n\n17. Bangladesh\n\nAverage Ranking: 110.5\n\nBangladesh’s democratic credentials have been taking a hit since the last few years, as the current ruling party led by PM Hasina Wajid continues to strengthen its hold over the country by crushing the opposition. The US State Department recently expressed concerns over the fairness of elections held in the country earlier this year.\n\n16. Thailand\n\nAverage Ranking: 89\n\nSince the initiation of Thailand’s constitutional era in 1932, it has been ruled by serving and retired military officers for more than six decades, with elected prime ministers seeing only 25 years of rule. The country dropped 8 ranking spots in EIU’s latest index, from 55th in 2022 to 63rd in 2023. It is ranked 115th on V-Dem’s 2024 Democracy Report. There is a long way to go for Thailand to improve its democracy rankings.\n\n15. Singapore\n\nAverage Ranking: 81.5\n\nNext on our list of the most democratic countries in Asia is Singapore, which has been ranked 69th and categorized as a flawed democracy by the Economist Intelligence Unit, while it took 94th spot in V-Dem’s democracy report. Singapore has a parliamentary form of government, led by the prime minister and his cabinet.\n\n14. Armenia\n\nAverage Ranking: 81\n\nThe loss of the Nagorno-Karabakh region to Azerbaijan led to a complete collapse of support for the political government in Armenia, which resulted in it dropping two positions in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s rankings. Despite that, Armenia is the most democratic country in the Caucasus, and among the most democratic countries in Asia.\n\n13. Philippines\n\nAverage Ranking: 77.5\n\nThe Philippines is one of Asia’s oldest and vibrant democracies, with a presidential form of government where the public elect their head of state. The countries’ democracy has been widely acclaimed for its electoral processes, political participation, and civil liberties. Efficient functioning of the government is an area the Philippines lacks at, according to the EIU and V-Dem.\n\n12. Nepal\n\nAverage Ranking: 77\n\n2023 was a good year for Nepal’s democracy as it climbed three positions on EIU’s index, and also showed improvement on all democratic indicators considered by V-Dem in its democracy report. Nepal abolished monarchy in 2008, and has a representative, multi-party democracy.\n\n11. Bhutan\n\nAverage Ranking: 76\n\nDespite being new to democracy, Bhutan is among the most democratic countries in Asia. The country had its first ever parliamentary elections in 2008, and recently concluded its fourth general elections in December last year, with an impressive turnout of 63%.\n\n10. Sri Lanka\n\nAverage Ranking: 74.5\n\nSri Lanka’s democracy has suffered a setback with the 2022 political and economic crisis, which resulted in the collapse of the government led by the Rajapaksa brothers. The country is still in the process of recovering from the crisis. It was ranked 70th by the EIU and 79th by V-Dem in their democracy indices.\n\n9. India\n\nAverage Ranking: 72.5\n\nIndia is the largest democracy in the world, with about 969 million voters set to cast their vote in the upcoming general elections starting this month. Despite the rise of right-wing populism in India, the country remains a robust democracy and has introduced electronic voting machines to enhance polling transparency and election fairness.\n\n8. Indonesia\n\nAverage Ranking: 71.5\n\nIndonesia is the third largest democracy in the world. The country was ranked 56th and categorized as a flawed democracy by the EIU in its 2023 Democracy Index, dropping two positions compared to the previous year. It was listed 87th on V-Dem’s 2024 Democracy Report.\n\n7. Mongolia\n\nAverage Ranking: 70\n\nNext on our list of the most democratic countries in Asia is Mongolia, which has climbed seven positions on the EIU’s index to rank 59 this year, while it was ranked 81st in V-Dem’s democracy report. According to the EIU, the country fares well when it comes to electoral process and civil liberties, but there are areas of improvement when it comes to functioning of government.\n\n6. Malaysia\n\nAverage Ranking: 65\n\nMalaysia is one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia, known for its transparent electoral process and strong governance. It ranks sixth on our list of the most democratic countries in Asia. The country practices a parliamentary form of government headed by the prime minister.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Democratic Countries in Asia.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 30 Most Democratic Countries in the World 20 Least Censored Countries with Most Internet Freedom 8 Countries Ruled by Military Dictatorship in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Most Democratic Countries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Put Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 26% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Alphabet shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 26% to 29% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future EPS 100% free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$194b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nIs Alphabet Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nYou can't deny that Alphabet has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Of course, just because Alphabet is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article5 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nYet another stronger-than-expected jobs report published on Friday is further dampening investors’ hopes of seeing the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June. Analysts have started to predict that the Federal Reserve might further delay its first rate cut to avoid seeing a strong rebound in inflation down the road. Piper Sandler said in its fresh note that latest data is showing the US labor market is “even stronger than we thought and maybe getting stronger.” Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, also said in a note that investors are beginning to digest the possibility of not seeing three rate cuts this year. He thinks the Fed could cut rates twice this year, but it’s still early to say anything.\n\nPossibility of No Rate Cuts in 2024?\n\nMoving expectations from three rate cuts to two won’t be a big deal for the market, given the resilience of the labor market, strong household savings and the AI revolution that keeps pushing stocks higher. But what if the Fed kills the possibility of any rate cuts this year because of sticky inflation and strong hiring? A few months ago this would have sounded like an impossible thing to say. Today, it’s totally a possibility.\n\n\"If the economy is running the way it's running now through most of this year, then it might be likely that the Fed does not cut interest rates this year,” Saglimbene added.\n\nCan Smaller Companies Benefit from the AI Rally? Taking Guidance from History\n\nDespite this backdrop, more and more market experts have been saying that the AI-led rally that boosted large-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and many others, is starting to broaden out to smaller companies. They say for long-term investors it’s time to pile into small-cap stocks in the technology sector. Hartford Funds in a report last month said that historically, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks but this trend averages out and reverses after ten years. The report noted that small-cap companies have been trading at low forward P/E ratios when compared to their large-cap counterparts for years, and if we use history as our guide, a “switch to small-cap outperformance is due.”\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in High-Quality Small-Cap Stocks\n\nThe last thing any sane investor would want in this uncertain environment is volatility and turbulence. So why would it make sense to invest in penny stocks or small companies? After all small-cap stocks have become synonymous with volatility. Small-cap proponents say that not all small-cap stocks are equal. For long-term investors who want to make money investing, opportunities lie in the small-cap universe. A GMO report published in 2022 talked about the importance of investing high quality small-cap stocks. What are high quality small-cap stocks? According to GMO, which said it has been investing small-cap quality stocks since 2004 as part of its “Quality Strategy”, high quality companies have “high margins, high returns on capital, low debt, and stable fundamentals.” This is what the firm found out about high quality small-cap companies:\n\n“High-quality small cap companies have delivered stronger returns than the small cap universe, with lower volatility. Since 1976, small cap quality has outperformed the small cap asset class in the U.S. by 1.8% annualized and has also outperformed the all-cap U.S. market by 2.8% annualized. These more predictable, long-term winners are very often undervalued by the market, buried under the buzz of stocks long on narrative but short on fundamental stability.”\n\nPerformance of Small Companies So Far in 2024\n\nBut how have small-cap and micro-cap stocks been performing this year? Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT), which invests in small-cap technology stocks, is up just 5.80% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500’s return of 27%. So far this year, the ETF is down 3.56%. But artificial intelligence is doing its wonders in the small-cap space too, since smaller names like Super Micro and MicroStrategy, part of the small-cap focused Russell 2000, poste huge returns on the back of the AI wave. A recent Wall Street Journal report said, citing data from LSEG, that these two companies collectively accounted for about a third of the Russell 2000’s 5.2% return in the first quarter.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, it would be interesting to see which smaller tech companies hedge funds are investing in. In this article we first scanned Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds and their holdings and picked 11 penny technology stocks (trading under $5) with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "Summers Says Hot Jobs Data Show Neutral Fed Rate ‘Much Higher’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the surge in US payrolls in March illustrates that the Federal Reserve is well off in its estimate of where the neutral interest rate is, and cautioned against any move to lower rates in June.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Area Hit by Biggest Quake in 140 Years; Flights Disrupted Texas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 Billion Zimbabwe Replaces Battered Dollar With New Gold-Backed Currency Called ZiG Saudi Crown Prince MBS’s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest Falters Turkey Joins NATO Allies in Suspending Europe Arms Treaty\n\n“This was a hot report that suggested that, if anything, the economy is re-accelerating,” Summers said on Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin. Alongside other factors including an “epic” loosening in financial conditions, “it seems to me the evidence is overwhelming that the neutral rate is far higher than the Fed supposes,” he said.\n\nThe neutral rate is the theoretical level for the Fed’s benchmark that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed policymakers last month estimated it at around 2.6% — the median estimate of their forecasts. Summers reiterated his own view is that neutral is 4% or higher. That compares with the current target range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\n“There’s a slight element of restriction, but only a slight one” given the Fed’s current rate setting, said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV.\n\nEarlier this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his skepticism about the idea of using estimates of a neutral rate as a guide for policy. The question of what the neutral rate will be going forward “doesn’t really matter for policy today,” he said in answering questions at a Stanford University event.\n\nLast year, Powell said that it’s possible the short-term neutral rate might be higher than the long-term one, and also that the long-term one itself might be higher, but ultimately the calculation is “unknowable.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSummers, by contrast, said it’s important to have a guide-post in setting current policy. “There’s no way to judge what policy is without knowing what would be a neutral policy,” he said.\n\n“Saying ‘we don’t need to know what the neutral rate is’ is like saying you should drive your car on feel, without looking at the speedometer,” Summers said. “It is just a mistake,” he said, while noting that he hadn’t seen Powell’s specific remarks this week.\n\nThe former Treasury chief spoke after the March jobs report showed a 303,000 increase in payrolls that outstripped every economist’s forecast in Bloomberg’s survey, with the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.8% even as the size of the labor force expanded.\n\nRead more: US Jobs Roar Again as Payrolls Jump 303,000, Unemployment Drops\n\n“I don’t want to make a prescription for monetary policy in June, but on current facts and current trends, I think it would be an inappropriate act to cut rates” at that meeting, Summers said.\n\nFutures trading suggests traders are increasingly betting that September will be the most likely meeting for the Fed to start lowering rates. They also suggest doubts about whether policymakers will follow through on the three rate reductions for 2024 that were indicated in their projections, known as the dot-plot.\n\n“My best guess is that the right thing to do is going to be to stick where we are for considerably longer than the Fed dot-plot supposes,” Summers said. While it’s “certainly more likely than not that the next move will be down and should be down” in rates, there’s still “a real possibility that it should be up,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future China’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Eyes HubSpot (HUBS): Potential Deal Brewing?",
        "content": "According to market speculations, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL is reportedly considering a bold move into the realm of online marketing software by exploring the acquisition of HubSpot Inc. HUBS, a company valued at $35 billion. The potential deal comes at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the tech sector under the Biden administration.\r\n\r\nWith a substantial cash reserve of $110.9 billion as of December 2023, Alphabet is probably considering HubSpot as an opportunity to strategically deploy its resources and expand its market presence. Although discussions have taken place with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley, Alphabet has yet to formally submit an offer to HubSpot.\r\n\r\nHubSpot, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, specializes in providing sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses, leveraging digital channels such as blogs, search engines and social media. Its diversified offerings include customer relationship management (CRM) and payment services, making it an attractive asset for Alphabet.\r\n\r\nFrom Alphabet's perspective, acquiring HubSpot would not only bolster its presence in the burgeoning CRM software market but also provide a significant boost to its cloud computing business, intensifying competition with industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon. Additionally, Alphabet could potentially argue that this acquisition will enhance competition in the marketing and sales software sector, countering the dominance of players like Salesforce and Microsoft.\r\n\r\nFor HubSpot, an acquisition by Alphabet could offer access to greater resources and technological capabilities, enabling it to further innovate and expand its market reach. While neither company has confirmed the discussions, market speculations are driving investor interest, underscoring the potential significance of this deal for both companies in navigating the evolving landscape of the tech industry.\r\n\r\nShares of HubSpot surged 100.8% in 2023, driven by improved market demand across its portfolio on the back of a flexible business model and solid cash flow. With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears primed for a similar performance in 2024 as well and is likely to be a lucrative acquisition target for Alphabet.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold Nvidia and Alphabet Shares Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. Here Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers.\n\nHe correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest.\n\nIt raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA changing of the guard\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.\n\nThe sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million.\n\nIn this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead\n\nIn moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.\n\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.\n\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.\n\nThe company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.\n\nAnd with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.\n\nA timely investing lesson\n\nSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.\n\nThere's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.\n\nInfluential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "INSIGHT-Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data",
        "content": "By Katie Paul and Anna Tong\n\nNEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market.\n\nToday only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life.\n\nCEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.\n\nHe has discussed rates of between 5 cents and $1 dollar per photo and more than $1 per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought.\n\n\"We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more,' Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has.\n\n\"You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?\"\n\nPhotobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology.\n\nTech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice.\n\nAt the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,\" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training.\n\nReuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materializing, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent.\n\nOpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions.\n\nGoogle added that it would \"take immediate action, up to and including termination\" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation.\n\nMany major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly $2.5 billion now and forecast it could grow close to $30 billion within a decade.\n\nGENERATIVE DATA GOLD RUSH\n\nThe data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI \"foundation\" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as \"training\" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete.\n\nTech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as \"publicly available.\"\n\nTheir approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping.\n\nIn response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand.\n\nIn the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements.\n\nThe deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from $25 million to $50 million each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's Chief Financial Officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh \"flurry of activity\" in the past two months, he added.\n\nYahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public.\n\nA Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers.\n\nOpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organizations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details.\n\n'ETHICALLY SOURCED' CONTENT\n\nAn industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data.\n\nSeattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters.\n\nRates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay $1 to $2 per image, $2 to $4 per short-form video and $100 to $300 per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is $0.001 per word, she added.\n\nImages of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for $5 to $7, she said.\n\nDefined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as \"ethically sourced,\" as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added.\n\nOne of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts.\n\nThe priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity.\n\nTo fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said.\n\nHe said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities.\n\nHis company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymize and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added.\n\n'I WOULD FIND IT RISKY'\n\nWhile licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed.\n\nAI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent.\n\nPhotobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the \"unrestricted right\" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads.\n\n\"We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,\" he said.\n\nDefined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from \"platform\" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights.\n\n\"I would find it very risky,\" Braga said of platform content. \"If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem.\"\n\nPhotobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with \"select AI companies.\" In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models.\n\nAhead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations.\n\nThe FTC, which warned businesses in February against retroactively changing terms of service for AI usage, declined to comment on the Reddit inquiry or say whether it was looking into other training data deals.

(REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nChipmaker AMD fell victim to the broader tech rout in US stocks on Thursday, falling 8.3% by the closing bell as part of a selloff sparked by comments from Federal Reserve officials which cast doubt on imminent rate cuts.\n\nIndices took a bath after Minnesota Fed president Neel Kashkari suggested the Fed may not cut interest rates at all this year if inflation progress stalls.

        "content": "US technology giant Google has slapped two Chinese developers with a lawsuit in New York federal court, accusing them of defrauding about 100,000 people through fake cryptocurrency investment apps on the company's Play Store.\n\nAccording to the Google lawsuit that was filed on Thursday, Yunfeng Sun in Shenzhen and Hongnam Cheung in Hong Kong ran what is known as a \"pig-butchering\" scam since 2019 that involved uploading 87 bogus apps - purported to be cryptocurrency exchanges and other investment platforms - on Play Store to ensnare unwitting users in the US and Canada.\n\nThe fraudsters' scheme also involved initially developing a friendship or romantic relationship with the victims, and then persuading them to make investments through the apps they operate, the lawsuit said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe fraudulent apps ran by the two Chinese developers \"affected consumers across the globe\" and resulted in \"substantial financial losses\" to Google users, the US tech giant said in its lawsuit.\n\nWhile Google had made efforts to remove those apps, the company said the two defendants managed to create more apps using \"new aliases and infrastructure\", and by making \"repeated material misrepresentations\" regarding their identity and activities.\n\nGoogle's lawsuit shows the continued rise of pig-butchering scams around the world, which have duped tens of thousands of victims into making fraudulent investments online.\n\nAfter victims make several cryptocurrency investments through fake sites, they discover that any request to make a withdrawal or cash out their investment is denied, according to a recent FBI warning in the US. The scammers even request additional investments, taxes or fees for the victims to obtain their money. Once the victims' funds are exhausted, the scammer cuts off contact and vanishes with the money.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Asia, these fraudsters have became more prevalent since the Covid-19 pandemic. A large number of scammer from mainland China, for example, operate out of compounds in Southeast Asia and try to swindle people worldwide with fake investment schemes.\n\nGoogle claimed in its lawsuit that the two Chinese app developers would send \"wayward\" text messages to victims as a way to \"strike up a conversation\". After exchanging initial messages with the victims, the defendants \"shifted the conversations to other messaging platforms such as WhatsApp\".\n\nThey would also publish videos online that promoted the fraudulent investment apps, according to the lawsuit. After victims deposited money into the apps that purported to offer high returns, these bogus platforms would prevent them from withdrawing money through various schemes.\n\nSun and Cheung's apps, including one named TionRT that passed itself off as a cryptocurrency exchange, caused financial losses that ranged from US$100 to tens of thousands of dollars per individual victim, Google said.\n\nGoogle also alleged that it \"suffered economic damages\" of more than US$75,000 in investigating their scheme, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBeijing has recently ramped up its crackdown on pig-butchering operations in Asia. In 2023, Myanmar authorities handed more than 44,000 suspected online scammers to their Chinese counterparts in a joint law-enforcement action, China's state broadcaster CCTV said in a report in January.\n\nAnother 807 suspects were arrested in Myanmar last month, including 455 Burmese nationals and 354 Chinese nationals, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported earlier this month.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "YouTube Says OpenAI Training Sora With Its Videos Would Break Rules",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The use of YouTube videos to train OpenAI’s text-to-video generator would be an infraction of the platform's terms of service, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 Billion S&P 500 Falls 1% as Oil Jump Spurs Flight to Bonds: Markets Wrap Apple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car Fizzles Kim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios Biden Tells Netanyahu US Support Hinges on Protecting Civilians\n\nIn his first public remarks on the topic, Mohan said he had no firsthand knowledge of whether OpenAI had, in fact, used YouTube videos to refine its artificial intelligence-powered video creation tool, called Sora. But if that were the case, it would be a “clear violation” of YouTube’s terms of use, he said.\n\n“From a creator’s perspective, when a creator uploads their hard work to our platform, they have certain expectations,” Mohan said Thursday in an interview with Emily Chang, host of Bloomberg Originals. “One of those expectations is that the terms of service is going to be abided by. It does not allow for things like transcripts or video bits to be downloaded, and that is a clear violation of our terms of service. Those are the rules of the road in terms of content on our platform.”\n\nThere has been much public debate over what material OpenAI uses to train the AI models underlying popular content creation products such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. Sora and other generative AI tools work by sucking up all sorts of content from around the web and using that data as the foundation from which the tools can generate new content, including videos, photos, narrative text and more. As companies like OpenAI, Google and others race to develop more powerful artificial intelligence, they are looking to source as much content as possible to train their AI models to get better quality results. Google and YouTube are units of Alphabet Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft Corp., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month that she wasn’t sure whether Sora was trained on user-generated videos from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. The Journal reported this week that OpenAI has discussed training its next-generation large language model, GPT-5, on transcriptions of public YouTube videos, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMohan said Google adheres to YouTube’s individual contracts with creators before deciding whether to use videos from the platform in training the company’s own powerful AI model, Gemini.\n\n“Lots of creators have different sorts of licensing contracts in terms of their content on our platform,” Mohan said. Though “some portion of that YouTube corpus maybe being used” to train models like Gemini, Google and YouTube ensure that using the videos as training data for Google’s AI is “in concert with whatever the terms of service or the contract that that creator has signed” beforehand, he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane Tiger Woods’ Putter Choice Has Created an Asset Class\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Why HubSpot (HUBS) Stock Is Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of sales and marketing software maker HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) jumped 9.4% in the afternoon session after Reuters reported that Google expressed interest in acquiring the company. According to sources, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is in talks with investment bankers about a potential offer.\n\nFollowing the news, Wall Street analysts weighed in on the development, with Stifel analyst expressing reservations regarding the deal. \"We believe this would be heavily challenged by regulators given the DOJ already has two suits pending against the company across its Search business and its Ad Tech practices.\" Stifel also touched on the potential merits of the deal, noting, \"In our view, Google would be able to leverage its rich data assets that are aggregated across Gmail, its market-leading digital advertising products (Search, YouTube, network, etc.), and its small but growing Cloud business (Hubs might entice more GCP usage)....We also believe this acquisition could help Google's position in digital advertising with greater ability to leverage first-party data, all in one platform, as Google looks to purge third-party cookies on Chrome later this year.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy HubSpot? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nHubSpot's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 10 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago, when the stock gained 5.5% on the news that the company reported first-quarter results that exceeded analysts' billings, revenue, gross margin, free cash flow, and earnings per share (EPS) expectations. Customer growth also accelerated. In addition, management provided revenue and EPS guidance for the next quarter and full year above Consensus estimates. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company on an absolute basis and relative to SaaS peers, some of which stumbled and called out a difficult macro environment.\n\nHubSpot is up 22.4% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of HubSpot's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,080.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "title": "Tech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides when AGI is attained?",
        "content": "There’s a race underway to build artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can.\n\nAchieving such a concept — commonly referred to as AGI — is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft.\n\nIt's also a cause for concern for world governments. Leading AI scientists published research Thursday in the journal Science warning that unchecked AI agents with “long-term planning\" skills could pose an existential risk to humanity.\n\nBut what exactly is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained? Once on the fringe of computer science, it’s now a buzzword that’s being constantly redefined by those trying to make it happen.\n\nWhat is AGI?\n\nNot to be confused with the similar-sounding generative AI — which describes the AI systems behind the crop of tools that “generate” new documents, images and sounds — artificial general intelligence is a more nebulous idea.\n\nIt's not a technical term but “a serious, though ill-defined, concept,” said Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist who's been dubbed a “Godfather of AI.”\n\n“I don't think there is agreement on what the term means,” Hinton said by email this week. “I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do.”\n\nHinton prefers a different term — superintelligence — “for AGIs that are better than humans.”\n\nA small group of early proponents of the term AGI were looking to evoke how mid-20th century computer scientists envisioned an intelligent machine. That was before AI research branched into subfields that advanced specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology — from face recognition to speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.\n\nMainstream AI research \"turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which at the beginning was pretty ambitious,” said Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University and helped organize the first AGI conference in 2008.\n\nStory continues\n\nPutting the ‘G’ in AGI was a signal to those who “still want to do the big thing. We don’t want to build tools. We want to build a thinking machine,” Wang said.\n\nAre we at AGI yet?\n\nWithout a clear definition, it's hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved artificial general intelligence — or if they already have.\n\n“Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google's) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,” Hinton said. “Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.”\n\nImprovements in “autoregressive” AI techniques that predict the most plausible next word in a sequence, combined with massive computing power to train those systems on troves of data, have led to impressive chatbots, but they’re still not quite the AGI that many people had in mind. Getting to AGI requires technology that can perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning and the ability to learn from experiences.\n\nSome researchers would like to find consensus on how to measure it. It's one of the topics of an upcoming AGI workshop next month in Vienna, Austria — the first at a major AI research conference.\n\n“This really needs a community’s effort and attention so that mutually we can agree on some sort of classifications of AGI,” said workshop organizer Jiaxuan You, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One idea is to segment it into levels in the same way that carmakers try to benchmark the path between cruise control and fully self-driving vehicles.\n\nOthers plan to figure it out on their own. San Francisco company OpenAI has given its nonprofit board of directors — whose members include a former U.S. Treasury secretary — the responsibility of deciding when its AI systems have reached the point at which they “outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”\n\n“The board determines when we’ve attained AGI,” says OpenAI's own explanation of its governance structure. Such an achievement would cut off the company's biggest partner, Microsoft, from the rights to commercialize such a system, since the terms of their agreements “only apply to pre-AGI technology.”\n\nIs AGI dangerous?\n\nHinton made global headlines last year when he quit Google and sounded a warning about AI's existential dangers. A new Science study published Thursday could reinforce those concerns.\n\nIts lead author is Michael Cohen, a University of California, Berkeley, researcher who studies the “expected behavior of generally intelligent artificial agents,” particularly those competent enough to “present a real threat to us by out planning us.”\n\nCohen made clear in an interview Thursday that such long-term AI planning agents don't yet exist. But “they have the potential to be” as tech companies seek to combine today's chatbot technology with more deliberate planning skills using a technique known as reinforcement learning.\n\n“Giving an advanced AI system the objective to maximize its reward and, at some point, withholding reward from it, strongly incentivizes the AI system to take humans out of the loop, if it has the opportunity,” according to the paper whose co-authors include prominent AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell and law professor and former OpenAI adviser Gillian Hadfield.\n\n“I hope we’ve made the case that people in government decide to start thinking seriously about exactly what regulations we need to address this problem,” Cohen said. For now, “governments only know what these companies decide to tell them.”\n\nToo legit to quit AGI?\n\nWith so much money riding on the promise of AI advances, it's no surprise that AGI is also becoming a corporate buzzword that sometimes attracts a quasi-religious fervor.\n\nIt's divided some of the tech world between those who argue it should be developed slowly and carefully and others — including venture capitalists and rapper MC Hammer — who've declared themselves part of an “accelerationist” camp.\n\nThe London-based startup DeepMind, founded in 2010 and now part of Google, was one of the first companies to explicitly set out to develop AGI. OpenAI did the same in 2015 with a safety-focused pledge.\n\nBut now it might seem that everyone else is jumping on the bandwagon. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was recently seen hanging out at a California venue called the AGI House. And less than three years after changing its name from Facebook to focus on virtual worlds, Meta Platforms in January revealed that AGI was also on the top of its agenda.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company's long-term goal was “building full general intelligence” that would require advances in reasoning, planning, coding and other cognitive abilities. While Zuckerberg's company has long had researchers focused on those subjects, his attention was a change in tone.\n\nAt Amazon, one sign of the new messaging was when the head scientist for the voice assistant Alexa switched job titles to become head scientist for AGI.\n\nWhile not as tangible to Wall Street as generative AI, broadcasting AGI ambitions may help recruit AI talent who have a choice in where they want to work.\n\nIn deciding between an “old-school AI institute” or one whose “goal is to build AGI” and has sufficient resources to do so, many would choose the latter, said You, the University of Illinois researcher.",

        "content": "Google is launching an experiment within its search engine that will see generative AI used to respond to some search queries.\n\nThe technology giant said the experiment in the UK would involve an unspecified subset of queries and would be tested on a small percentage of search traffic.\n\nIt will see so-called “AI overviews” appear at the top of search results, giving an AI-generated text response to the query, offering answers and further context around the query.\n\nGoogle said a handful of different variations of response will be used in the test, including some which offer bullet point or headings giving more detailed responses. The new AI Overview will offer a broader response to a search query, shown here in the tips section (Google/PA)\n\nMore traditional link-based search results will appear within as well as below the AI overview, with Google saying it was focused on continuing to drive traffic to the web.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK test follows a similar small-scale experiment previously launched in the US.\n\nHema Budaraju, senior director of product management at Google, said bringing generative AI to Google Search would “supercharge” it by making it simpler and smarter.\n\n“By bringing the power of GenAI directly to search, you can unlock entirely new types of functions that you never thought Search could answer, and transform the way information is organised, to help you start to make sense of the information,” she said.\n\nShe added that the AI overviews could help quickly and easily bring together multiple perspectives from different places more simply, and help give users a “jumping off point” so that they can get a “broader overview” of a subject from one query.\n\nIt is the latest move by the US firm to further integrate artificial intelligence-powered tools into new and existing products.\n\nIt recently rolled out a dedicated app for its Gemini chatbot for the first time, as well as offering a subscription service to access its more powerful AI models.\n\nGoogle has also previously integrated AI tools into its smartphones, notably within the device’s camera and editing features.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company has had issues with its AI rollout in the past.\n\nIn February, Google paused the rollout of an AI-powered image generator tool within Gemini after users found it would generate inaccurate images and representations of historical figures, often including an overly broad range of races and genders.\n\nSome commentators suggested Google had overcorrected over fears about ongoing racial bias issues within artificial intelligence applications, which in the past has seen facial recognition software struggling to recognise, or mislabelling, black faces, and voice recognition services failing to understand accented English.\n\nGoogle apologised over the incident and said it has “missed the mark”.",

As we’ve done many times before, we’ll continue to build new premium capabilities and services to enhance our subscription offerings across Google.”\n\nThe potential move suggests the Alphabet Inc. unit still hasn’t figured out how to incorporate the new, fast-growing technology without threatening its essential advertising business. The shares were down less than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nEver since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, Google has found itself on the defensive in the face of the wildly popular chatbot. ChatGPT’s ability to give answers to queries in a narrative voice has forced Google to rethink its traditional list of blue links to websites and the lucrative ads that appear alongside them. Meanwhile, in recent years, a new crop of search startups has emerged. Some have tried to persuade users to sign up for paid subscriptions to access generative AI search features, or for better privacy protections.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Google began testing its own AI-powered search service that combines the personalized, detailed narrative in addition to links to websites and advertising. But it has been slow to incorporate features from its experimental “search generative experience” to the main search engine.\n\nIn February, Google added a new paid tier to its consumer subscription service that gives people access to its latest AI model, Gemini. Users who pay for that subscription, called Google One AI Premium, are able to use its advanced Gemini chatbot and access the generative AI model in popular services such as Gmail and Google Docs.\n\nUsing generative AI technology to power search queries is “eye-wateringly” expensive, said one former Google employee, who worked on the company’s search products. Teams regularly ran benchmark tests on random queries internally to measure how quickly Google’s search engine could deliver results — but they didn’t run the same tests for Google’s AI-powered search product in part because it was so costly, the former staffer said.\n\nIn the wake of ChatGPT’s appearance, Google has reoriented its search teams to deploy more people to work on the experimental AI-powered experience, according to another former Google employee. While early feedback was positive, the high cost likely factored into the decision not to roll it out more widely, the person said. A Google spokesperson said the company has been focused on improving issues such as latency and adding new features, and that cost hasn’t influenced the company’s decisions about how fast to incorporate more AI into search.\n\nFor Google, charging for certain AI search aspects could help the company shake loose some additional revenue, without cannibalizing its core search ad business, said Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“Given OpenAI has reached a subscription run-rate of $2 billion with consumer subscriptions, we believe Alphabet could see a similar boost to its $15 billion subscription sales,” he wrote in an email.\n\n(Updates with detail on Google’s efforts to incorporate AI into search and premarket sharees)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future How Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane Canada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Google has surprised investors and users with it's plan to charge for AI services. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)\n\nGoogle has caught investors and users by surprise after reports that it could charge users for some of its AI-related services in what would be the biggest shake-up of its commercial model.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, it is looking at whether to add certain AI-powered search features to its premium subscription services which already offer access to its new AI assistant called Gemini, Google's version of the chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nThe search giant, which is owned by Alphabet, has never before put any of its core products behind a paywall.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: EU stocks rise as traders weigh up Fed comments and await ECB minutes\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nExecutives have reportedly not yet made a decision when or whether to move ahead with the technology but the FT said engineers were developing the know-how needed to deploy the service.\n\nAlphabet's shares dipped about 1% in extended trade.\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nSpotify was higher in extended trading after the music streaming service revealed plans to raise prices in five different regions, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nSpotify Technology SA intends to raise prices on its plans by about $1 (£0.79) to $2 a month in five markets including the UK, Australia and Pakistan by the end of April. The company will raise prices in the United States later this year.\n\nUnder the new pricing, individual plans will go up by about $1 a month, while family plans and so-called duo plans for couples will rise by $2, the Bloomberg report added.\n\nOn a monthly basis, Spotify offers premium plans including $10.99 for an individual, $14.99 for duo and $16.99 for family in the US, according to the company's website.\n\nIn the UK, a premium individual accounts currently comes in at £10.99, a duo costs £14.99 and the family package will set you back £17.99 a month.\n\nParamount Global (PARA)\n\nParamount Global is reportedly in exclusive acquisition talks with Skydance Media, according to the New York Times.\n\nShares surged by over 14% and were higher in extended trading after reports that Skydance and Paramount entered a 30-day exclusive negotiating window Wednesday and have already agreed on terms, though Skydance still needs to ensure it can merge its movie studio with Paramount’s.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe deal currently being discussed with Skydance would involve Skydance’s buying National Amusements, the company that holds Shari Redstone’s voting stock in Paramount. The enlarged Skydance would then acquire Paramount Global, which is publicly traded, in a two-step process.\n\nRead more: How to stop being a workaholic\n\nThis follows a recent $26bn all-cash offer from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management.\n\nParamount owns the Paramount film and TV studios, streaming service Paramount+, broadcast network CBS, and cable channels such as Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central.\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nVodafone’s £15bn plan to merge with Chinese-owned rival Three will face an in-depth investigation by the competition regulator.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it will launch a so-called Phase 2 probe after both firms told the regulator they would not be offering measures to ease its concerns ahead of the deadline.\n\nThe telecoms giant last year agreed to merge with Three in a deal that will create the UK’s largest mobile network with more than 27 million customers.\n\nHowever, the tie-up has attracted scrutiny due to concerns that Three’s Hong Kong-based parent company CK Hutchison could be granted access to sensitive national infrastructure.\n\nThe regulator said it found in its initial probe that the two companies are important alternatives for mobile customers and combining these two businesses will reduce rivalry between mobile operators to win new customers.\n\nThe watchdog also raised concerns that the deal “may make it difficult” for smaller mobile operators – such as Sky Mobile, Lebara and Lyca Mobile – to negotiate good deals for their own customers, by reducing the number of mobile network operators which will host them.\n\nWatch: The two best-positioned megacap tech stocks in 2024: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/\\\">AMZN</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">META</a>) were among the tech stock leaders who drove growth in the S&P 500 (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=^GSPC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^GSPC</a>) throughout 2024's first quarter.

        "title": "7 Nancy Pelosi Stocks Still Worth Buying in Q2",
        "content": "In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market.\n\nThat’s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let’s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you’re going to disagree with that last point. That’s okay. The point is you can’t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress.\n\nWell, maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Let’s move on – below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it’s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.\n\nFundamentally, it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What’s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it’s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50. That’s a significant increase over last year’s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that’s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023’s $6.89 billion tally. It’s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there’s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there’s also a solid chance you’re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy.\n\nYes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That’s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can’t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don’t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That’s a decent bump from last year’s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we’re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year’s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I’m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft’s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to.\n\nYes, the spotlight centers on the company’s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It’s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year’s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we’re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year’s haul of $211.91 billion.\n\nI think it’s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE:AXP). Don’t get me wrong – I think it’s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I’m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.\n\nLet’s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies, AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It’s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts’ EPS targets.\n\nLooking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $11.21. For revenue, we’re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023’s tally of $60.52 billion.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nTo start, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It’s understandable. While the entertainment giant – which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts – commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year’s revenue. Nevertheless, it’s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it’s worth considering.\n\nIn Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts’ EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That’s earnings growth if I’ve ever seen it.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year’s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it’s a solid wager.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nThe former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had.\n\nOne of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it’s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet’s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn’t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That’s a big jump from last year’s print of $5.80. Also, they’re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we’re talking a large gap from last year’s result of $307.39 billion.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc.

It’s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I’d say it’s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it’s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that’s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.\n\nStill, I’m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It’s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That’s a bit disappointing compared to last year’s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year’s tally of $29.77 billion. It’s worth looking into if you’re a contrarian.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter",
        "content": "The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.\n\nThe quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.\n\nSpeaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.\n\nOh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe good\n\nLet’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.\n\nAlso this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US. Nvidia's founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, meanwhile, made headlines for ending its electric car project. According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.\n\nFinally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe bad\n\nThings weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.\n\nThe FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”\n\nThe upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nThe DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball though, and are looking into whether they’re complying or not.\n\nThe hits kept coming for Google during the quarter, after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.\n\nCongress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.\n\nThe ugly\n\nNothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.\n\nFinally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat.\n\nIt’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement. That is to say, the good stories could flip and become bad or ugly and vice versa. On to Q2.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 1 Other Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC tried to get to the bottom of the recent market decline amid rising yields and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plan. Cramer said that the latest market decline was not \"consequential\" because if the upcoming jobs report comes in weaker than expected, the market will rebound as people would expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to avoid a hard landing. Cramer said it's been a while since we saw a broader selloff, so we \"forgot\" how to \"handle\" one.\n\nCramer Explains the \"Real\" Reasons Behind the Latest Selloff\n\nThe CNBC host tried to get to the \"real reasons\" behind the latest selloff and found them in earnings, which he said are always important for him. Cramer first talked about payroll solutions company Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) which recently posted downbeat sales for the fiscal third quarter ending February 29, 2024. Cramer specifically highlighted Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO comments delivered during the company's latest earnings call where he talked about some trends he's seeing in the jobs market.\n\n\"But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now.\n\nOur clients tell us they still can’t find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients.\" [read the full earnings call transcript here.]\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer then turned to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he believes does not deserve to be in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks anymore. Cramer said that the problems Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing have to do with the overall declining demand for EVs in the US. He said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing what Ford and GM had already faced.\n\nCramer said that the \"real problem\" with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is that it turned out to be a car company instead of an \"immortal tech company.\" However, Cramer said Tesla is a \"headline grabber\" and it always will be.\n\nCramer Recommends Investors to \"Hunker Down\" and Wait\n\nJim Cramer reiterated that we should always expect a 10% pullback on average every two years, based on the analysis of legendary economist Peter Lynch.  He also said that there weren’t \"many\" stocks that saw declines in the latest selloff. Instead, he thinks most of the losses were seen by individual stocks based on specific events and catalysts. Cramer thinks the market was overbought and the selloff was due, and he said it's not over yet. Cramer recommend investors to \"hunker down\" and wait for the markets to rebound.\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending mega-cap quality names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past few months as he's highly bullish on the AI revolution that is boosting several names under his coverage. Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few weeks and picked some of the most important stocks he discussed. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, where applicable. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nOn March 26, when Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) was skyrocketing, Cramer said on CNBC that if I were Donald Trump \"this is the moment\" when you'd say it's time to release more shares.\n\n\"I am not sure where Mr. Trump's head is, but this is a moment where he could say, look, the stock's up 286%. No one would mind if I sold stock, so please let me do it.\"\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) shares have pared gains since. The stock is down 26% over the past five days as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) recently revealed that it had a net loss of about $58 million in 2023, while revenue in the period was $4.1 million.\n\n10. AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer is highly bearish on mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). A caller recently asked Cramer whether he should buy AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) stock for dividends. Cramer’s reply was a resounding “No.” He asked the questioner to see how the stock has performed over the past few years, or “any period” for that matter. Cramer said this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” Cramer is bearish on AGNC but recommends buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for the long term.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). The biggest stakeholder of AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) during this period was Karim Abbadi and Edward Mcbride’s Centiva Capital which owns a $16 million stake in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC).\n\n9. Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nWater handling and recycling solutions company Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about recently. Cramer said that he’s a bit late to the stock since Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have “almost doubled.” Cramer said he’d wait for a pullback in the stock price.\n\n“Let’s see if we can get it back to $10.”\n\nAris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have gained about 64% so far this year.\n\n8. Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nTexas-based software company Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) stock is a Buy, according to Jim Cramer. When asked about the stock, Cramer said that it's a very \"well-run\" company. He also said that a government business is a \"good business.\"\n\nTyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) is one of the stocks seeing heavy insider selling activity this year. John S Marr Jr, Tyler Technologies Inc's (NYSE:TYL) former CEO and current executive chairman of the board, sold 7,500 shares of Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) on March 13 at $425.07 per share.\n\nHere is what Andvari Associates has to say about Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. Companies with high growth prospects, like Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), also declined. A third group also declined: our investments in fixed income and preferred securities for retirement accounts naturally declined in value as the prices of these securities go down when interest rates go up.”\n\n7. Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on automated electronic broker platform company Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR). When asked about the stock in a latest program, Cramer said that it’s an “incredibly well-run company” and “everybody feels that way.” In the same vein Jim Cramer also recommended investors to consider buying Charles Schwab shares. In addition to IBKR, Cramer is recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nInteractive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) shares have gained about 39% over the past one year.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Third quarter’s earnings were above consensus estimates, aided by the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses. Despite the beat, its shares lost -4% due to reduced expectations around inorganic account growth as two new Asian broker relationships have been pushed out.”\n\n6. Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 51\n\nJim Cramer hit the “Buy, Buy, Buy” button on Texas-based construction engineering company Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) during a latest Lightning Round segment of his program Mad Money on CNBC. Cramer said that Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is “just fantastic.” He said Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is a great infrastructure player.\n\n“I think you’ve got a winner there.”\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Along with DexCom, notable adds in the quarter included Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) and Jabil. Quanta provides outsourced skilled labor for maintenance and construction services, primarily to utilities. We have followed the company for over a decade and have witnessed its shift from oil and gas to renewables. The energy transition (solar and wind farms, electric vehicles, etc.) requires investments in the US energy grid to support greater electrification. At the same time, climate change is increasing stress on the existing grid, forcing utilities to increase maintenance spending. Furthermore, Federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, will help fuel Quanta’s long-term growth given its expertise in transmission and distribution connections as renewable energy infrastructure seeks to connect to the grid. The stock sold off early in the quarter on concerns that higher interest rates would lead to a pullback in renewables investments by utility customers. However, based on our industry research, we think Quanta’s key customers are well resourced and committed to meeting long-term electrification needs via infrastructure investment. We used the selloff as an opportunity to move the position into the CropSM at a more attractive valuation.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "An AI-Rally for Software Makers Will Demand Investor Patience",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors need more patience for the euphoria about artificial intelligence to lift the stocks of software makers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead Trump Media’s Business Doesn’t Matter Trump Got His $175 Million Bond From a Billionaire Fan’s Company TSMC Halts Some Chipmaking as Taiwan Gauges Quake Fallout Kim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios\n\nAt a time when surging demand for AI infrastructure are spurring traders to bid up hardware manufacturers such as Dell Technologies Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., software companies are having trouble convincing the market that similar growth is on the horizon.\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has climbed 17% this year, supported by makers of chips and servers such as Nvidia Corp. and others tethered to AI. Meanwhile, an index of software stocks whose members include Adobe Inc. and Salesforce Inc. has gained less than 4%.\n\n“We’re not seeing tangible lifts to earnings,” said Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy Truist Advisory Services. “A lot of companies talk about utilizing and benefiting from AI, but we still need to see use cases and how willing their customers will be to pay. That clarity may not come until next year.”\n\nWhile expectations are that artificial intelligence will reshape entire economies, such hopes are yet to be borne out in fundamentals.\n\nAdobe, for example, dashed expectations about a lift from generative AI for its creative-arts software in a weak sales forecast last month, with its shares slumping more than 20% from this year’s high.\n\nSalesforce, which is investing in AI-based features to help spark sales of its customer relations management software, also gave a lackluster outlook when it reported earnings in February.\n\nEven Alphabet Inc. has struggled with offerings that have been dogged by accuracy issues and internal criticism about the usefulness of its AI tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue contribution from AI remains minimal even though customers are interested in the technology, wrote Brian White, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. Markets “will grow increasingly suspicious of generative AI propaganda,” he said.\n\nOn the whole, software firms are expected to achieve less than half the earnings growth of semiconductor peers in 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The past earnings season also showed that they’re more likely to miss consensus when compared to their hardware counterparts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“Near-term expectations of generative AI may be outpacing fundamentals,” wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. While AI remains a focus for software executives, “project sizes and use cases remain smaller in nature rather than large-scale transformation changes.”\n\nWaiting Game\n\nStill, while AI may not yet be showing up in results, investors view a looming impact as a matter of time.\n\nTake Adobe. While its forecast may have been disappointing, recent product announcements underlined its competitive position. For Alphabet, talks with Apple Inc. to use the Google-parent’s AI model in its iPhone lineup is viewed as a win for both.\n\nMicrosoft Corp is already pointing to the technology as a driver of growth, with efforts to bake AI into a variety of marquee products including Azure, Office and Windows starting to pay off.\n\n“Every company realizes there is great potential here, so they are building applications and doing trials,” said Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer for Franklin Equity Group. “The impact is absolutely coming, and being concerned that we haven’t seen it yet is way too short-term a view.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index fell 0.9% on Tuesday, sinking in a broad-based decline amid speculation over when interest rates will be cut. Just 15 components of the tech-heavy index rose, making for one of the weakest days of the year by this measure, as well as the lowest number of advancers since mid-February.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest maker of advanced chips, halted some chipmaking machinery and evacuated staff after the biggest earthquake to hit its home island in 25 years. As Tesla Inc. grapples with a global slowdown in EV demand that contributed to its largest-ever quarterly sales miss, Elon Musk’s carmaker is also steadily losing ground in China — the world’s biggest automotive market. Intel Corp., revealing new details about its manufacturing operations, said that losses have deepened at the chipmaker’s factory network and the business may not reach a break-even point for several years. Elon Musk says that while he doesn’t own any Disney shares today, he would “definitely” buy its shares if Nelson Peltz was elected to the company’s board, according to a post on X. A Chinese-state intrusion last year of Microsoft Corp. technology that enabled hackers to gather US officials’ emails “should never have occurred,” according to a report released Tuesday from a government cyber review board.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nBlackBerry\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk Has a Porn Problem EV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China’s Car King How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future AI Energy Crisis Boosts Interest in Chips That Do It All Canada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion's share of the heavy lifting has been done by the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have taken Wall Street to new heights\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%. MSFT Chart\n\nThe second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter. Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in April: Meta Platforms\n\nAmong the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.\n\nBut there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta.\n\nAs noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta.\n\nSomething that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in April: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not all Magnificent Seven members are poised to be winners moving forward. The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nSomething else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace.\n\nAs I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers.\n\nRegulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nLast but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend. This makes Nvidia a stock worth avoiding in April.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Browsing in incognito mode doesn't protect you as much as you might think",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Although a private browsing mode known as “Incognito\" in Google's widely used Chrome browser has been available for nearly a decade, a legal settlement involving the way it works has casting new attention on this commonly available setting.\n\nThe settlement disclosed Monday in a federal court is primarily designed to ensure that users who use Incognito mode in Chrome get more privacy while surfing the internet than they had been previously.\n\nAlthough Google isn't paying any money to consumers, the lawyers who filed the case in June 2020 believe the stricter safeguards will be worth $4.75 billion to $7.8 billion, based on the estimated value of the personal information protected by the settlement.\n\nNearly every major browser now has a private browsing mode. Here's a look at what they do and don't do for surfers.\n\nWhat private browsing actually does\n\nWhen you turn on your browser's private mode, think of it as a fresh start.\n\nSo all of the advantages of browser personalization won’t be there: No suggestions based on your history, autocomplete will be largely unavailable and you will have to sign into your accounts.\n\nAs soon as you close your incognito window, your internet browser wipes the browsing history and any cookies that have been created during that session, according to the Mozilla Foundation, meaning -- locally to your device — your browser won’t remember where you’ve been or store any information you filled into any forms.\n\nThis kind of experience does have its uses. For example, making sure searches on more sensitive topics, like health care, don’t show up in your browsing history (which may invite related ads to start showing up). Or perhaps you'd like added protection when surfing — or logging onto accounts — on public computers, like at the library or a hotel business center.\n\nWhat private browsing doesn't do\n\nRemember that the point of a private browsing mode is not to cover the fact that you visited a website but to cover the fact that you visited that site from your device.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncognito modes generally do not prevent the websites you visit from seeing your location, via your IP address, or stop your internet service provider from logging your activities. As long as your IP address is visible, the Mozilla Foundation says your identity and activity remain fully exposed to search engines and third parties — think advertisers — regardless of what mode your browsing in.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Google recently agreed to purge billions of records containing personal information collected from people using incognito mode to surf the internet as part of a settlement over a lawsuit accusing the search giant of illegal surveillance. It also has to be make more prominent privacy disclosures in its terms of service to let people know about its data collection efforts.\n\nGoogle will also be required to set up Incognito mode so users will be able to automatically block “cookies” that enable third parties to track them during the next five years if a federal judge approves the settlement after a court hearing scheduled July 30.\n\nAnd any files you may download or bookmarks you create during a private session are not wiped at the end of your session, meaning you are still susceptible to computer viruses, malware and keystroke loggers.\n\nAre there options for more private browsing?\n\nA virtual private network can run interference for your IP address, making it harder for sites to track you. But the use of VPNs also raises additional security questions, especially for users who go with a free or cheap VPN provider they haven’t carefully vetted.\n\nSome search engines like DuckDuckGo are more privacy focused and have pledged to never collect personal information or track people entering queries on its site. And certain browsers like Tor are designed to make it more difficult for third-party trackers and advertisers to track you.\n\nEven with all of these options, just remember that it’s unlikely that you’re truly anonymous online.",

It’s not an overstatement to say that AI has the potential to be the biggest game-changer in technology since the internet itself.\n\nThe best AI investments will provide a platform for other tangential businesses. Not only will they be utilizing AI to better serve their customers, but they will be also building new AI-driven products and services to forever change industry dynamics. Here are our three picks for the best AI stocks to consider for your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s largest companies and owns several dominant brands in the tech industry. These include Google Search, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Currently, the stock’s median price target of $163.12 represents a potential 10% upside from its current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite facing a couple of missteps at the start, this big tech company has been one of the first to jump right into the AI waters. Google Bard, for instance, made headlines for producing inaccurate responses that put it a level below ChatGPT. Now though, beyond simply Google Bard, Google has launched AI appliances such as Vertex AI and Project IDX to help websites, workspaces and workflow. As Gemini (a rebranded Bard) slowly becomes the leading generative AI platform integrated into Google’s suite of applications, investors can be optimistic about this company’s strength as one of the AI industry’s leaders.\n\nAlphabet also remains one of the cheapest mega-cap stocks relative to its competitors, trading at just 22.27x forward earnings and 6.25x sales. In terms of earnings, this makes GOOGL cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Alphabet’s strength is also demonstrated by its 14 consecutive quarters of increased revenue and five-year revenue CAGR of 18%. As far as AI and blue-chip tech stocks go for us, GOOGL is a no-brainer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company most recognized for its flagship products including Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, and Premiere. Yahoo Finance analysts currently give a consensus average price target of about $574.00, 15% higher than today’s closing price.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, you might not immediately think of Adobe. Nonetheless, the company has been leveraging generative AI to give its creative customers some of the most comprehensive artistic tools. These include the Adobe Firefly platform which will drastically grow the scale of deliverable AI-generated branded content for enterprise users and content creators. In fact, one of the early adopters of Adobe Firefly was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which used the platform to create its Dreamworld campaign.\n\nLooking at its financials, we see a stock that trades at roughly a fair value compared to its tech industry peers. However, where Adobe truly stands out is its profitability. Adobe currently has an 88.08% gross margin, over 80% higher than its sector median of 48.62%! With a 10-year net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as well, we see Adobe as a profitability cash cow in the AI space.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American multinational cybersecurity company that was founded in 2011. Yahoo Finance analysts almost all rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a median one-year price target nearly 20% higher than its current price.\n\nThe bull case for Crowdstrike and AI is twofold. The first case is based on its Falcon platform. This platform is trained on trillions of historical security events and utilizes AI and machine learning to identify, detect, and neutralize potential threats. Additionally, Crowdstrike also has a generative AI security analyst named Charlotte that can help users with its diverse range of products. As elevated cybersecurity concerns arise due to the increase in AI used for malicious reasons, we see Crowdstrike as an investment at the forefront of solving these issues.\n\nCRWD has already gained nearly 150% over the past 52 weeks. While its valuation is slightly elevated over its sector mean, we find confidence in its outstanding balance between growth and profitability. For instance, despite growing at a five-year revenue CAGR Of 65%, CRWD has still managed to maintain incredibly strong gross margins of over 75%!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tuesday, April 2, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Chevron Corporation (CVX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAlphabet shares have modestly lagged the Zacks Tech sector over the year-to-date period (+9.6% vs. +12.2%), but have performed roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index (+9.6% vs. +10%) over this time period. The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Also, its expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. However, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+19.5% vs. +11.4%). The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefited from the steady adoption of strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and OCI, as well as a recovery in cloud revenue growth.\r\n\r\nOracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence (AI) clientele because of better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the uncertain economy and competition in the cloud computing market weighed on demand for its cloud offerings. Stiff competition in the cloud market is slowing down the growth of its expansion efforts in the competitive market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nChevron shares have underperformed the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-2.6% vs. +4.5%). The company is grappling with lower prices in the upstream segment and declining refining margins in the downstream unit.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Chubb Limited (CB), Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Google has agreed to delete billions of records containing personal information collected from millions of people through its Chrome web browser, as part of a settlement agreement in a lawsuit in the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Google of tracking Chrome users’ internet activity even when they had switched the browser to “Incognito” mode, a setting which is supposed to shield a user from being tracked.\n\nThe details of the deal emerged on Monday, more than three months after Google and its legal team disclosed they had resolved a lawsuit brought in June 2020 which focused on the privacy controls of the firm’s Chrome web browser. The Incognito mode on Google’s Chrome browser is supposed to shield a user from being tracked (Picsmart/Alamy/PA)\n\nThe settlement requires Google to delete billions or personal records stored in its data centres, and make more prominent privacy disclosures about Chrome’s Incognito mode when it is activated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe data deletion also applies outside the US.\n\nThe agreement also imposes other controls designed to limit Google’s collection of personal information.\n\nWhile Google is supporting the deal, it disputes the claims as “meritless”, and said it was only required to “delete old personal technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalisation”.\n\nIn contrast, lawyers representing Chrome users depicted the settlement as a major victory for personal privacy in an age of ever-increasing digital surveillance, according to court papers.\n\nThey valued the settlement at between 4.75 billion US dollars (£3.77 billion) and 7.8 billion US dollars (£6.2 billion), based on calculations of potential advertising sales that the personal information collected through Chrome could have generated in the past.",

        "title": "Prediction: 5 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.\n\nBy the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock may be in a bubble\n\nOver the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nNvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.\n\nNvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.\n\nThe chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.\n\nHere are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.\n\n1. Alphabet: $1.88 trillion current market cap (Class A shares, GOOGL)\n\nThe first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nThe reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.\n\n2. Amazon: $1.87 trillion current market cap\n\nLike Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nHowever, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: $1.24 trillion current market cap\n\nEven though social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.\n\nMeta's \"secret sauce\" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.\n\nThe other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match. BRK.A Chart\n\n4. Berkshire Hathaway: $908 billion current market cap (Class A shares, BRK.A)\n\nA fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!\n\nOne of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the \"Oracle of Omaha's\" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.\n\nWarren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.\n\n5. Visa: $573 billion current market cap\n\nThe fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa(NYSE: V). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.\n\nWhat makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nVisa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: You'll Regret Not Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) became a Wall Street darling last year when it cornered the market on artificial intelligence (AI) chips and earned its spot in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a phrase used to describe the seven most prominent tech companies. As a result, the company's stock is up 242% since last March, almost entirely based on excitement over its AI prospects.\n\nWith the industry projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030, it's no wonder investors have flocked to the market. However, plenty of companies are moving into AI and could have more room to run than Nvidia or might be trading at a better value than the chipmaker.\n\nConsequently, it's a good idea to look for alternative ways to invest in the budding sector. Other companies in the Magnificent Seven are an excellent place to start, with many known for their reliability over the long term and heavy investment in AI.\n\nSo forget Nvidia. You'll regret not buying these Magnificent Seven stocks instead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai describes the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" This year, a poor debut for its new large language model Gemini created doubt over its potential in the industry. However, the company remains a behemoth in tech, with significant cash reserves that will likely see the company retain its dominance and eventually catch up to its AI rivals.\n\nIn-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and Google have granted Alphabet a powerful position in tech. These brands attract billions of users and have helped the company's annual revenue rise 90% in the last five years, with operating income up 135%. Meanwhile, Alphabet's many products create almost endless opportunities to boost its business with AI.\n\nImproving Gemini could see Alphabet offer more effective advertising, develop a search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, better analyze viewing trends on YouTube, and expand its AI cloud services on Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe chart above shows Alphabet's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. These are helpful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health, and the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's free cash flow of nearly $70 billion, compared to Nvidia's $27 billion, suggests it's potentially better equipped to keep investing in its business and overcome current headwinds.\n\nThe Google company may have hit a few roadblocks this year, but that's precisely why now is the perfect time to make long-term investments in its stock. The Magnificent Seven company has an exciting outlook for the coming years and trades at a bargain, compared to Nvidia.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) delivered impressive growth in 2023 after facing declines from an economic downturn in 2022. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion.\n\nA solid recovery in its e-commerce earnings over the last year has seen the company's free cash flow soar 904% to surpass $32 billion. This indicates it has the financial resources to continue expanding and manage possible hurdles.\n\nAmazon has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out of Seattle almost 30 years ago. The tech giant has expanded into multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nAmazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, the table above indicates Nvidia's earnings could reach $36 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Amazon's may achieve $7 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios (Nvidia's 36 and Amazon's 43) yields stock prices of $1,309 for Nvidia and $301 for Amazon.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 45% by fiscal 2026 and Amazon's increase by 67%. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and expanding position in AI, Amazon is a Magnificent Seven stock worth considering over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google said it would delete millions of records of user’s browsing activities as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit that alleged it tracked people without their knowledge.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nErdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal Elections Trump’s Net Worth Drops $1 Billion as Social Media Firm Sinks Tesla Has Wall Street Worried About How Many Cars It Just Sold Caribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU Crackdown Gold Pares Gains From Record as US Factory Data Spurs Fed Debate\n\nThe case, filed in 2020, alleged the Alphabet Inc. unit surreptitiously collected data from people using its popular Chrome web browser in a private “incognito” browsing mode. While that function lets users turn off data collection when using the Chrome browser, other Google tools used by websites, such as advertising technology, scoop up their data anyway, according to the suit. The plaintiffs asked for $5 billion in damages.\n\nGoogle, which agreed to settle in December, will expunge “billions” of data records that reflect people’s private browsing, according to details that were made public Monday in a filing at San Francisco federal court, the search giant agreed to Google also said it made several changes to its disclosures to clarify how people’s data is collected and what activity is visible to websites when users browse in “incognito” mode. And the company agreed for the next five years to allow incognito mode users to block third-party cookies.\n\n“We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We never associate data with users when they use incognito mode. We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization.”The plaintiffs’ lawyers, led by attorney David Boies, called the settlement “groundbreaking” and a “historic step” in requiring big tech companies to be transparent to users about how they collect and use their data. Google’s agreement to retroactively delete user information is a significant concession as it forms the backbone of the company’s lucrative advertising business, which depends on the quality of its search engine. It also comes as Google is in the throes of multiple regulatory challenges in the US and abroad, amid rising concerns about how the tech giants use the vast amounts of data they collect from users.\n\nStory continues\n\n“There has been a steady drumbeat of complaints, lawsuits, and regulatory action centered on companies collecting or sharing customer data in unexpected ways,” said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester. “The rise of privacy-oriented class action lawsuits and complaints shows consumers are increasingly privacy savvy and taking action.\"\n\nThe settlement provides “substantial relief” for plaintiffs, according to representatives of the consumers in the lawsuit, which include attorneys from the law firms Boies Schiller Flexner and Morgan & Morgan. Though the agreement doesn’t include monetary damages, it allows individuals to file claims. So far, at least 50 individuals have done so, the lawyers said.\n\nThe settlement also forestalled a trial that was scheduled for February, in a year that’s expected to be one of Google’s busiest in the courts. A jury trial in a lawsuit from the US Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general accusing the company of violating antitrust regulations by illegally monopolizing digital advertising is slated for September, and a similar lawsuit from Texas and other states challenging its ad tech practices has been scheduled for March 2025.\n\nIn a third case, a US judge in Washington is set to hear closing arguments in May for a landmark federal antitrust trial that alleges the company has illegally monopolized the online search market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned FTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Google to purge billions of files containing personal data in settlement of Chrome privacy case",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has agreed to purge billions of records containing personal information collected from more than 136 million people in the U.S. surfing the internet through its Chrome web browser.\n\nThe records purge comes as part of a settlement in a lawsuit accusing the search giant of illegal surveillance.\n\nThe details of the deal emerged in a court filing Monday, more than three months after Google and the attorneys handling the class-action case disclosed they had resolved a June 2020 lawsuit targeting Chrome's privacy controls.\n\nAmong other allegations, the lawsuit accused Google of tracking Chrome users' internet activity even when they had switched the browser to the “Incognito” setting that is supposed to shield them from being shadowed by the Mountain View, California, company.\n\nGoogle vigorously fought the lawsuit until U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected a request to dismiss the case last August, setting up a potential trial. The settlement was negotiated during the next four months, culminating in Monday's disclosure of the terms, which Rogers still must approve during a hearing scheduled for July 30 in Oakland, California, federal court.\n\nThe settlement requires Google to expunge billions of personal records stored in its data centers and make more prominent privacy disclosures about Chrome's Incognito option when it is activated. It also imposes other controls designed to limit Google's collection of personal information.\n\nConsumers represented in the class-action lawsuit won't receive any damages or any other payments in the settlement, a point that Google emphasized in a Monday statement about the deal.\n\n“We are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was meritless,\" Google said. The company asserted it is only being required to “delete old personal technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn court papers, the attorneys representing Chrome users painted a much different picture, depicting the settlement as a major victory for personal privacy in an age of ever-increasing digital surveillance.\n\nThe lawyers valued the settlement at $4.75 billion to $7.8 billion, relying on calculations based primarily on the potential ad sales that the personal information collected through Chrome could have generated in the past and future without the new restrictions.\n\nThe settlement also doesn't shield Google from more lawsuits revolving around the same issues covered in the class-action case. That means individual consumers can still pursue damages against the company by filing their own civil complaints in state courts around the U.S.\n\nInvestors apparently aren't too worried about the settlement terms affecting the digital ad sales that account for the bulk of the more than $300 billion in annual revenue pouring into Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Shares in Alphabet rose nearly 3% during Monday's afternoon trading.\n\nAustin Chambers, a lawyer specializing in data privacy issues at the firm Dorsey & Whitney, described the settlement terms in the Chrome case as a “welcome development” that could affect the way personal information is collected online in the future.\n\n“This prevents companies from profiting off of that data, and also requires them to undertake complex and costly data deletion efforts,” Chambers said. “In some cases, this could have a dramatic impact on products built around those datasets.”\n\nGoogle is still facing legal threats on the regulatory frontier that could have a far bigger impact on its business, depending on the outcomes.\n\nAfter the U.S. Justice Department outlined its allegations that the company is abusing the dominance of its search engine to thwart competition and innovation during a trial last fall, a federal judge is scheduled to hear closing arguments in the case May 1 before issuing a ruling anticipated in the autumn.\n\nGoogle is also facing potential changes to its app store for smartphones powered by its Android software that could undercut its revenue from commissions after a federal jury last year concluded the company was running an illegal monopoly. A hearing examining possible revisions that Google may have to make to its Play Store is scheduled for late May.",

Google is paying no damages, but users may sue the company individually for damages.\n\nThe class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since June 1, 2016.\n\nUsers alleged that Google's analytics, cookies and apps let the Alphabet unit improperly track people who set Google's Chrome browser to \"Incognito\" mode and other browsers to \"private\" browsing mode.\n\nThey said this turned Google into an \"unaccountable trove of information\" by letting it learn about their friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits, and the \"most intimate and potentially embarrassing things\" they hunt for online.\n\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \"private\" browsing, a process it has already begun.

        "title": "Why tech investors are placing bets on the 'Hail Mary' of energy",
        "content": "The promise of nuclear fusion energy has long trailed reality.\n\nWidely viewed as a holy grail technology due to its potential for near-limitless amounts of clean energy, the inability to get fusion power on the grid despite decades of research has led to a running joke: Fusion energy is always 30 years away.\n\nBut that timeline may be finally shrinking thanks to recent technological breakthroughs and increasing capital from private investors, including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Sam Altman. The industry has now attracted more than $6 billion in funding to date, according to data from the Fusion Industry Association (FIA), with companies such as Google (GOOG) and Chevron (CVX) as part of a growing list of backers.\n\n“Previously, it was always the government making investments to the Department of Energy or other governments around the world,” FIA CEO Andrew Holland told Yahoo Finance. “Well, now it's private industry, private businesses, startups, who are saying, 'What do we need to design from the beginning? How do we design for commercial applications?' That makes for some different calculations.”\n\n'An entirely new source of energy'\n\nFusion energy has been considered a game changer largely because of how the power source is generated. Unlike nuclear fission, which occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, splitting it into two, fusion occurs by taking two atoms and smashing them together to create a heavier atom.\n\nThe fusion process is the same process that powers the sun and other stars. What's even more attractive to researchers is fusion doesn’t produce nuclear waste that can be weaponized.\n\n“If it's successful, the development of fusion energy could dwarf even AI in terms of its meaning for humankind,” said David Callaway, founder of Callaway Climate Insights. “We’re talking about an entirely new source of energy.”\n\nDespite the excitement around its potential, technological breakthroughs have largely been limited to government research labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved ignition, a critical milestone that demonstrated that it was possible to generate more energy than the amount of energy it took to create the fusion reaction. But that energy gain lasted for less than one-billionth of a second. Researchers are now looking to extend that plasma reaction so it can be sustained for commercial use. National Nuclear Security Administration's Marvin Adams holds up a cylinder he says is similar to one used for a breakthrough in fusion research during a news conference on Dec. 13, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nChallenges remain in race to commercialize fusion\n\nNow, more than 40 startups are racing ahead with the goal of becoming the first to commercialize fusion. Washington-based Helion Energy has set one of the most aggressive targets, signing a commercial agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to provide power generated by fusion in four years. Meanwhile, MIT-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has raised funding from Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson, aims to have a commercial plant up and running by the 2030s.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence estimated that the valuation for fusion energy is likely to grow to $40 trillion if it captures just 1% of the global gigawatt energy output.\n\n“What we do know is that we have a very targeted set of goal-driven experiments and research efforts going on around the world that are trying to solve remaining challenges,” said David Pace, deputy director at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, which is home to the country’s largest magnetic fusion facility and is funded by the Department of Energy. “The challenges are very laser-focused on issues that prevent us from building the kinds of facilities that produce net energy and then facilities that convert that net energy into electricity.” General view of the circular bioshield inside the construction site of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France, Nov. 7, 2019. (Jean-Paul Pelissier/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGovernments are also increasing funding to help accelerate commercialization. The US government set aside a record $1.48 billion for fusion research in its 2024 budget alone. And in France, home to the world’s largest fusion reactor — known as ITER — 35 countries have joined forces to build a facility estimated at roughly $20 billion.\n\nBut the path forward is far from clear, including the process by which fusion energy is likely to be commercialized. Facilities like ITER and DIII-D, for example, are utilizing doughnut-shaped machines known as tokamaks, which rely on powerful magnets to confine and insulate the plasma so temperatures are hot enough for the fusion reaction to occur. The breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was achieved through a process using lasers.\n\nExperts say the key to commercialization, in addition to maintaining net energy gain, is to build smaller, less expensive reactors at a rapid rate. In the most recent FIA report, 25 companies expressed optimism that the first fusion plant will deliver electricity to the grid before 2035.\n\nThe push to commercialize nuclear fusion has come with renewed urgency for a reliable source of clean energy in the face of climate change as governments look to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAt the most recent UN Climate Change Conference, former White House climate envoy John Kerry laid out a framework for international cooperation to accelerate the advancement of fusion energy while acknowledging its “scientific and engineering challenges.”\n\n“There's not many other options. We have to invest in something,” Callaway said. “We have to throw the Hail Mary, so to speak, of technology to try to solve this problem, which is driving oil interest and gas interests and countries against each other in response to climate change. So we're going to start to see more talk of fusion.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Here's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "\"April showers bring May flowers.\" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.\n\nYou might not think the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.\n\nCrossing names off the list\n\nWe can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.\n\nIt's a similar story for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.\n\nWall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.\n\nThe \"A team\"\n\nThat leaves the \"A team\" as the top contenders: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.\n\nApple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Apple?\n\nI'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.\n\nBut Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI because of its \"incredible breakthrough potential.\" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.\n\nIt's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the \"wow\" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Reddit\n\nReddit has claimed that incoming online safety laws could force social networks to quit Britain because of the burden of complying with the new rules.\n\nThe US company, which recently pulled off a $6.4bn (£5.1bn) Wall Street listing, has told Ofcom that holding less well-resourced companies to the same standards as giants such as Facebook and Google could lead them to pull out of the market altogether.\n\nReddit said: “If smaller companies are held to the same compliance standards as the largest players, their competitiveness may be diminished, they may opt to withdraw from the market, and newer entrants may be discouraged.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfcom is consulting on how to apply the Online Safety Act, which is designed to protect children online and crack down on illegal activity.\n\nIt will apply stricter conditions to major social networks, such as requiring them to offer verification and protect news content, but is considering where to set the bar.\n\nIn response to Ofcom’s consultation, Reddit claimed that it would be unfair to require it to stick to the same standards as bigger rivals.\n\n“It would… be fundamentally disproportionate and harmful to sectoral competition to hold a company of this size and corporate profile to the same regulatory standards as its competitors, some of whom are amongst the largest and most resourced companies in the world,” it said.\n\nMeta, which owns both Facebook and Instagram, is worth $1.24 trillion. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which is also subject to the Online Safety Act, is worth $1.88 trillion.\n\nReddit said in its submission: “If thresholds are premised on certain characteristics and functionalities alone, small-to-medium sized platforms will bear disproportionate economic, operational, and competitive disadvantages when placed in the same category as much larger companies.\n\n“A company’s capacity to shoulder the compliance requirements of demanding categories should be included in threshold criteria to protect competition and innovation.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe submission was written in September last year, but published recently.\n\nReddit has slightly more than 2,000 employees and relies heavily on volunteers to moderate parts of its social network.\n\nOfcom last week indicated it expected sites such as Reddit to fall under the strictest parts of the Online Safety Act.\n\nThe regulator set out criteria for a so-called “Category 1” service, saying sites that are used by more than 10pc of the UK population, and use social features such as content recommendation algorithms and re-sharing options would fall under the strictest rules.\n\nReddit is used by 37pc of the population, according to research commissioned by Ofcom.\n\nThe company’s shares have climbed by around 50pc since its initial public offering, one of the year’s biggest, last month.\n\nA spokesman for the company said Reddit did not wish to comment beyond the filing.",

        "title": "Gmail revolutionized email 20 years ago. People thought it was Google's April Fools' Day joke",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved pulling pranks, so much so they began rolling outlandish ideas every April Fools' Day not long after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a “scratch and sniff” feature on its search engine.\n\nThe jokes were so consistently over-the-top that people learned to laugh them off as another example of Google mischief. And that's why Page and Brin decided to unveil something no one would believe was possible 20 years ago on April Fools' Day.\n\nIt was Gmail, a free service boasting 1 gigabyte of storage per account, an amount that sounds almost pedestrian in an age of one-terabyte iPhones. But it sounded like a preposterous amount of email capacity back then, enough to store about 13,500 emails before running out of space compared to just 30 to 60 emails in the then-leading webmail services run by Yahoo and Microsoft. That translated into 250 to 500 times more email storage space.\n\nBesides the quantum leap in storage, Gmail also came equipped with Google's search technology so users could quickly retrieve a tidbit from an old email, photo or other personal information stored on the service. It also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic so everything flowed together as if it was a single conversation.\n\n“The original pitch we put together was all about the three ‘S’s” — storage, search and speed,\" said former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who helped design Gmail and other company products before later becoming Yahoo's CEO.\n\nIt was such a mind-bending concept that shortly after The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April Fools' 2004, readers began calling and emailing to inform the news agency it had been duped by Google's pranksters.\n\nStory continues\n\n“That was part of the charm, making a product that people won't believe is real. It kind of changed people’s perceptions about the kinds of applications that were possible within a web browser,\" former Google engineer Paul Buchheit recalled during a recent AP interview about his efforts to build Gmail.\n\nIt took three years to do as part of a project called “Caribou” — a reference to a running gag in the Dilbert comic strip. “There was something sort of absurd about the name Caribou, it just made make me laugh,” said Buchheit, the 23rd employee hired at a company that now employs more than 180,000 people.\n\nThe AP knew Google wasn't joking about Gmail because an AP reporter had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile.\n\nAfter arriving at a still-developing corporate campus that would soon blossom into what became known as the “Googleplex,” the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.\n\nPage, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail's sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft's now-retired Explorer web browser. And he pointed out there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn't be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be so easily searched. “I think people are really going to like this,” Page predicted.\n\nAs with so many other things, Page was right. Gmail now has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts — each one now offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Even though that's 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered, it's still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge their accounts, just as Google hoped.\n\nThe digital hoarding of email, photos and other content is why Google, Apple and other companies now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers. (In Google's case, it charges anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually for 5 terabytes of storage). Gmail's existence is also why other free email services and the internal email accounts that employees use on their jobs offer far more storage than was fathomed 20 years ago.\n\n“We were trying to shift the way people had been thinking because people were working in this model of storage scarcity for so long that deleting became a default action,” Buchheit said.\n\nGmail was a game changer in several other ways while becoming the first building block in the expansion of Google's internet empire beyond its still-dominant search engine.\n\nAfter Gmail came Google Maps and Google Docs with word processing and spreadsheet applications. Then came the acquisition of video site YouTube, followed by the introduction of the the Chrome browser and the Android operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. With Gmail's explicitly stated intention to scan the content of emails to get a better understanding of users' interests, Google also left little doubt that digital surveillance in pursuit of selling more ads would be part of its expanding ambitions.\n\nAlthough it immediately generated a buzz, Gmail started out with a limited scope because Google initially only had enough computing capacity to support a small audience of users.\n\n“When we launched, we only had 300 machines and they were really old machines that no one else wanted,” Buchheit said, with a chuckle. “We only had enough capacity for 10,000 users, which is a little absurd.\"\n\nBut that scarcity created an air of exclusivity around Gmail that drove feverish demand for an elusive invitations to sign up. At one point, invitations to open a Gmail account were selling for $250 apiece on eBay. “It became a bit like a social currency, where people would go, ‘Hey, I got a Gmail invite, you want one?’” Buchheit said.\n\nAlthough signing up for Gmail became increasingly easier as more of Google's network of massive data centers came online, the company didn't begin accepting all comers to the email service until it opened the floodgates as a Valentine's Day present to the world in 2007.\n\nA few weeks later on April Fools' Day in 2007, Google would announce a new feature called “Gmail Paper” offering users the chance to have Google print out their email archive on “94% post-consumer organic soybean sputum \" and then have it sent to them through the Postal Service. Google really was joking around that time.",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has $159 Billion Invested in These 8 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was \"extraordinary.\" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't \"know if it's beneficial.\"\n\nWhatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.\n\nThat could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.\n\nAmazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBuffett also owns shares of Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.\n\n5. NXP Semiconductors\n\nNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.\n\nAI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.\n\n6. Qualcomm\n\nThrough NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.\n\nQualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.\n\n7. IBM\n\nBerkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM(NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.\n\nIBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.\n\n8. Alphabet\n\nBuffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.\n\nAlphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.\n\nAre these Buffett AI stocks good picks to buy now?\n\nI think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market will have a significant impact on economic productivity and growth. It is a ripe field to find long-term winners, but as with any new technology, there will be winners and losers. A simple criteria to stack the odds in your favor is to invest in AI leaders that are turning a profit and generating loads of free cash flow from operations.\n\nTwo that come top to mind are AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). There are probably no other companies spending more on AI technology than these two. Their current valuations seem cheap relative to their growth and could deliver spectacular returns over the next decade.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares of Nvidia have soared 254% over the last year, as its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI-based applications. The company's dominance in the AI chip market has other companies vying for a piece of the pie. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are launching new chips they hope will compete with Nvidia, but it's easier said than done.\n\nNvidia is not just a GPU company. It also provides software, systems, and algorithms that create a platform of services for data scientists and AI researchers. This is why it earns sky-high margins, converting $0.49 of every dollar of revenue into a profit. Nvidia's free cash flow swelled to $27 billion last quarter on a trailing-12-month basis, which provides ample ammunition to invest in more innovation.\n\nSome investors are skeptical how long Nvidia's reign will last. This is why the stock trades at a relatively low valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38 is quite low for a company growing earnings at triple-digit rates.\n\nBut Nvidia's run is far from over. It's set to begin shipping the new H200 GPU later this year, which offers a leap in AI performance over the H100 that is fueling the company's growth right now. Plus, management is seeing growing interest from governments around the world that want to invest in AI to build large language models using their own languages. This could significantly extend Nvidia's growth runway.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Nvidia has everything you could want in an AI investment. It is enormously profitable, dominates the GPU market, and the stock is reasonably valued relative to its future prospects.\n\n2. Alphabet (Google)\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 47% over the last 12 months, beating the return of the S&P 500 index. The company's investments in AI for Google Search and its digital ad business are great reasons to consider holding the stock.\n\nGoogle is the leader in the digital ad market, but it is facing competition from Microsoft's Bing. Google Search has seen its market share decline in recent years, which could pressure growth in Alphabet's advertising revenue. This is why the stock is conservatively valued at a forward P/E of 22, which is lower than the average stock.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has strengths in data and AI that are underestimated. With billions of users across YouTube and Google, the company has loads of user data to make its AI models smarter, and it's got the resources to keep investing.\n\nIt is investing billions in new servers and data centers while growing its free cash flow to $69 billion in 2023. Alphabet plans to significantly increase spending in 2024 to prepare for growth opportunities in offering more AI applications for individual users, advertisers, developers, governments, and cloud enterprise customers.\n\nSpeaking of the cloud, AI will have a major impact on the growth of Google Cloud -- one of the largest cloud service providers for enterprise. Alphabet's cloud revenue grew 26% year over year in the fourth quarter, and the segment is starting to turn a profit, which could benefit the stock.\n\nAlphabet has tremendous financial fortitude, making it a relatively safe AI stock. It's a solid choice that can serve as a core holding in a well-diversified investment portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to rocket higher in the first three months of 2024, fueled in part by the continued outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe seven monster stocks accounted for practically all of the S&P 500's positive performance in the first half of 2023 and have continued to move higher as a group since then. Not every member of the group has beat the market in 2024, but those that have -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms -- have significantly outperformed. Apple and Tesla are the only members that have meaningfully lagged the broader index.\n\nWhile the performance of the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023 has been spectacular, every good investor knows past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors should be determining whether today's stock price justifies the potential future returns from the business. That's where one of the Magnificent Seven looks particularly appealing, and another member seems overpriced.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist right now\n\nWithin this elite stock group, the most attractively priced for long-term investors is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet is the company behind Google, which took a 92% share of the global online search market last month. That kind of reach is enviable for just about any ad-supported internet service, but Google can turn the dial a little more with its ancillary services. It counts nine separate products with over 1 billion users. That gives it a ton of data on its user base, which it can use to tailor its ad products and boost its prices relative to other companies.\n\nAmong those nine products with over 1 billion users is its Android operating system. The mobile OS holds a dominant global market share while still supporting nearly half of all smartphones in the U.S., where Apple's iPhone is exceptionally popular. Owning the mobile platform for the majority of smartphones in use around the world cements Google's position in search on mobile, despite regulatory challenges against its arrangement with Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's strong position in search resulted in 11% ad revenue growth in 2023. But Alphabet has several other growth drivers. Its public cloud computing service, Google Cloud, is growing quickly, up 26% last year. What's more, Alphabet's Other Bets segment includes several promising companies, including Waymo, its autonomous vehicle company. If any of these moonshots pay off, it could result in a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Alphabet and its investors.\n\nAlphabet is well-positioned for consistent revenue and profit growth for years to come. Meanwhile, the stock trades for a forward P/E ratio of 22.4. That's a slight premium to the S&P 500, but still inexpensive relative to its other high-flying peers in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWith consistent revenue growth and margin expansion, plus the potential for a moonshot to payoff, Alphabet looks like the best stock to buy among the tech giants.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague\n\nIf there's one stock among the \"Magnificent Seven\" I can't get on board with, it's Nvidia. Despite the strong performance of the company, the stock price seems to have gotten well ahead of the actual results. What's more, the outlook for the business doesn't look as strong as its recent past.\n\nNvidia's results have been driven by its data center business for the last few years, which mostly stems from the boom in artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs). Nvidia's graphics processing units are well-suited for training LLMs. Its chips are more performant and power-efficient than anyone else's off-the-rack solution, and it's managed to maintain that lead over competitors for a long time now. As a result, data center revenue grew from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in 2023 to $47.5 billion in 2024.\n\nNot only has Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed, but its margins expanded too. Gross margin expanded from 63% in the fourth quarter last year to 76% this year. Likewise, it exhibited incredible operating leverage over the past year, as operating expenses barely budged relative to its revenue.\n\nBut there's an important factor that's driven those results: supply constraints. Those supply constraints could be alleviated by the end of 2024, according to Nvidia's manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. At that point, gross margin will come down, and Nvidia will have to sell more chips to maintain revenue growth.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors are coming to market with viable alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs. Not only that, but some of its biggest customers, the big tech companies in the Magnificent Seven, have designed their own chips for training their LLMs. On top of that, demand should shift from the GPUs needed to train LLMs to chips needed for running AI applications on devices. As a result, the demand for Nvidia's chips may not sustain its current level.\n\nIt doesn't take an advanced economics degree to understand that growing supply and falling demand means prices will come down. While Nvidia can certainly do well despite the pressure, its stock is priced like companies will continue to pay top dollar for as many chips as Nvidia can produce.\n\nShares currently trade around 39 times forward earnings. But with profit margin under pressure as supply-demand levels normalize, it'll be hard for Nvidia to keep growing earnings at a level that can make that high multiple worth it for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Tech Giants that are Making Shopping Easier by Using AI\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provide various tools to make online shopping easier. Let's discuss some offerings from these companies. You can also take a look at the most advanced AI assistants.\n\nAmong its large suite of AI products, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also offers AI-backed shopping assistance to customers.

Customers can switch colors, styles, and designs to see what looks best. The tool caters to people with different skin tones, ethnicities, hair types, and body weight or shape. The tool is trained using Google's Shopping Graph. The Shopping Graph is an elaborate data set of the latest products, sellers, brands, reviews, and inventory.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also developing AI-powered shopping assistant tools. On June 29, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the launch of new AI shopping assistant tools in Edge and Bing. The shopping assistant helps customers find the right product by making comprehensive buying guides based on a customer's recommendations and choices. It also provides a smart compare table, so customers can easily view similar products and weigh in on the best option. The tools also help customers summarize reviews and the general brand sentiment to help customers make an informed decision. The Price Match feature allows users to find the best price and save money.\n\nCompanies are spending billions of dollars on integrating AI into shopping to enhance customer experience and with advancements in AI, this trend is expected to persist. According to a report by Future Market Insights, the global AI-powered retail market was valued at $7.14 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow to $85.07 billion by 2032, from $9.36 billion in 2024, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.8%. North America dominated the market with a share of $2.79 billion in 2023. Asia Pacific, on the other hand, is projected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast years.\n\nNow that we have discussed the role of AI in retail and how companies are leveraging it to boost shopping experiences, let's take a look at the 17 Great Alternatives to Amazon for Shopping Online.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "4 Spectacular Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "For the lion's share of this decade, volatility has ruled the roost on Wall Street. Beginning in 2020, all three major stock indexes began vacillating between bear and bull markets in successive years (not including 2024), with the growth stock-focused Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) seeing the largest percentage swings.\n\nAfter losing a third of its value during the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite has catapulted higher by 57% since the beginning of 2023 and taken out its previous high. There's no question that the innovation-fueled index is in the early stages of a bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut here's the thing about Wall Street's major indexes: Value can always be uncovered, no matter how pricey stocks may seem as a whole. Even with the Nasdaq rocketing to fresh highs, patient investors can still find growth stocks trading at a discount.\n\nWhat follows are four spectacular growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first awe-inspiring growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not grabbing with the Nasdaq Composite in a fresh bull market is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among its many ventures.\n\nThe only reason Alphabet hasn't completely blown the roof off of its previous high set in 2021 has to do with uncertainties tied to the advertising industry. In 2023, approximately 76% of Alphabet's $86.3 billion in net sales traced back to its vast advertising platforms. With a couple of money-based metrics (e.g., M2 money supply) and recession-predicting tools pointing to a potential downturn in the U.S. economy, ad-driven companies like Alphabet are at risk for near-term weakness.\n\nBut even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, they're over relatively quick. Only three recessions since the end of World War II have reached the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth endure for multiple years, which is fantastic news for ad-driven businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's operating \"heart and soul\" continues to be its internet search engine. In February, Google accounted for a 92% share of worldwide internet search, which is a practical monopoly. Being the undisputed leader means businesses are willing to pay Google a premium to get their message(s) in front of users.\n\nBut the latter half of the decade should see Google Cloud play a larger role in Alphabet's cash flow generation. Google Cloud is the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform by spend (as of September, per Canalys), and it just closed out its first year of profitability. Cloud-service margins are more robust than advertising margins, which should lead to a sizable boost to Alphabet's operating cash flow in the years to come.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Alphabet is valued at 13.5 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which represents a 24% discount to its five-year average multiple to cash flow.\n\nLovesac\n\nAmazing deals can be found in under-the-radar companies as well. The second spectacular growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite finding its stride is furniture stock Lovesac(NASDAQ: LOVE). Yes, I said \"furniture stock\" and \"growth stock\" in the same sentence.\n\nTypically, furniture companies are slow-growing, heavily reliant on brick-and-mortar stores, and they purchase their goods from the same small group of wholesalers. Lovesac is completely altering this perception with its furniture and sales approach.\n\nThe obvious differentiator for Lovesac is the company's products. Specifically, about 90% of its revenue comes from selling \"sactionals\" -- modular couches that buyers can rearrange dozens of ways to fit most living spaces. The yarn used in sactional covers is made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles, and buyers have more than 200 different covers to choose from. No other product offers this combination of functionality, optionality, and eco-friendliness in the furniture space.\n\nSomething else key to Lovesac's ongoing success is its targeting of well-to-do consumers. Lovesac's unique products come with an assortment of upgrade options, including built-in surround sound and wireless charging, which can lift the price of sactionals well above a traditional sectional couch. Thankfully, this isn't an issue, since its core, higher-earning customer is rarely fazed by minor economic disruptions.\n\nWhat ties everything together for Lovesac is its omnichannel sales platform. While it does have a traditional brick-and-mortar presence in 40 states, it's notably leaned on pop-up showrooms, brand-name partnerships (e.g., Costco Wholesale and Best Buy), and digital sales, as a means to reduce its overhead expenses and boost margins.\n\nDespite low double-digit sales growth, Lovesac's stock is valued at just 10 times forward-year earnings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWestern Digital\n\nThe third eye-catching growth stock you'll regret not buying with the Nasdaq bull market finding its footing is storage solutions specialist Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC).\n\nThere are often two prevailing headwinds for data storage companies. The first (as would be expected) is the health of the U.S. economy. Tech stocks are usually cyclical, so any potential for a downturn in the economy is likely to weigh on the storage industry.\n\nThe other is the overzealousness of storage companies. When pricing improves, they have a tendency to flood the market with supply and hurt their own margins.\n\nThe good news for Western Digital is that it should enjoy exceptional demand throughout the remainder of the decade on two fronts. First, enterprise cloud spending is still arguably early in its ramp-up. Researchers at Fortune Business Insights expect the global cloud computing market to grow by an annualized rate of 20% through 2030, ultimately reaching $2.43 trillion. As enterprise cloud expands, so does the need for storage solutions.\n\nTo add to this, Western Digital's NAND flash-memory solutions are ideally positioned to benefit from growing enterprise cloud needs. The higher transfer rates associated with NAND flash memory may make it an enterprise data-center staple by the turn of the decade.\n\nWestern Digital can also benefit from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts at PwC believe AI can add over $15 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. As the computational needs of AI-accelerated data centers grows, Western Digital's storage solutions will be in higher demand.\n\nThe valuation makes sense, too. With the sales forecast to grow by nearly 50% over the next four years, Western Digital's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 11 is a bargain.\n\nFastly\n\nA fourth spectacular growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is edge computing company Fastly(NYSE: FSLY). The company is best known for its content delivery network (CDN), which moves data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible.\n\nThe reason Fastly has underperformed over the past three years is its bottom line. Wider-than-expected losses and sizable share-based compensation under the company's previous CEO, Joshua Bixby, turned investors off to this growth story. However, the arrival of Todd Nightingale as the company's new CEO can change everything.\n\nNightingale officially took over in September 2022 and filled in key pieces of the puzzle that were missing. He previously worked as the lead for Cisco Systems' Enterprise Networking and Cloud segment. Not only does he have a keen understanding of what initiatives Fastly should tackle to grow its enterprise customer base, but he knows where costs can be reduced to move Fastly toward recurring profitability. Consensus estimates call for Fastly to reach recurring profits in 2025.\n\nSimilarly to Western Digital, Fastly is set to benefit from the steady shift of enterprise data online and into the cloud. As everything becomes more digital, end user demand for content grows. Since Fastly is a usage-driven platform, this is a recipe for higher gross profit.\n\nAnother reason long-term-minded investors can be excited about Fastly's prospects is that many of its key performance indicators are pointing higher. Average enterprise customer spend has increased 16% to $880,000 since March 31, 2022, while its dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) has stuck like molasses to the 118% to 123% range over the last eight quarters. What DBNER shows is that existing customers are spending between 18% and 23% more on a year-over-year basis.\n\nFastly's expected annualized earnings growth rate of 30% over the next five years makes it a premier growth stock to own.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss 30 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population.If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go to 10 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population instead.\n\nAs of 2024, there are over 8 billion people in the world. According to the United Nations, this number will see an increase of almost 2 billion by 2050, and by the mid-2080s, it can go as high as 10.4 billion people. In the mid-twentieth century, the total world population was nearly three times less than the number at which it stands today. In other words, Earth was home to 2.5 billion people in 1950, and nearly 70 years later, it grew to 8 billion.\n\nBut what do these numbers really mean? The global population can sound like an abstract concept to many. So, to wrap your mind around the concept, think of a football stadium, like the Michigan Stadium. Officially, the stadium has the capacity to host a crowd of 107,601 people. Now, if you are one of the spectators at this stadium, and if all 107,601 people showed up, the seats would still be full. If there were a few thousand more spectators, it would be only slightly more congested. However, if you added another 100,000 more people, there would neither be any seats left nor any room for anyone to move, given that the ground is a no-go zone.\n\nThis addition of people beyond the capacity of the land is exactly what’s happening to the world right now, and why overpopulation is such an incredibly important issue. While the Earth is huge, its resources are slowly but surely running out. World Resources Institute estimates that food production will have to grow by 50% to sustain the global population by 2050. It might look easy on the surface -- that is until you realize that 40% of the land has become too degraded for agricultural production, and as the UN shows, 90% of the world's topsoil faces risk by 2050 due to unsustainable agricultural practices. You can read more on this in our piece on the 12 most advanced countries in agricultural technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile population growth is a global issue that needs to be carefully navigated, it is also an opportunity for some business owners. According to Michigan State University’s report on the subject, population growth is economic growth. So, whether it is a country or a city, a large population generally equates to an economically prosperous region. For example, in India — the world’s most populous country in 2024 — various multinational corporations have realized the potential of competing in the markets in India. These MNCs realize that the country has a high demand for goods and services, and they have a great opportunity to make profits out of it. Note that a country or a city with a large population not only provides a large consumer base but can also provide for an equally large workforce.\n\nSome of the top leading multinational corporations, like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), have made huge investments in India for these very reasons.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), an American multinational technology company, debuted in India in June 2013. Now, with over 100,000 employees across the country, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s operations are not only limited to e-commerce but also span across Amazon Web Services, Amazon Payments, Amazon Music, and more. In June 2023, the company announced to take its investment to $26 billion by 2030 across verticals.\n\nSimilarly, in 2020, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also committed to invest around $10 billion through equity investments and tie-ups in India over the next five to seven years. Last year, in June, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced plans to open a global fintech operation center in GIFT City in India's western state of Gujarat, which is a substantial investment for the country’s fintech market.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) came to India in 1990 and expanded its operations across 10 cities in India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and New Delhi, employing over 20,000 workers. Recently, the CEO of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Satya Nadella, announced plans to invest in training 2 million people with artificial intelligence (AI) skills in the country by 2025. While the country offers a large consumer base, it has also become a leading hub for technology, attracting significant investments by these technology companies. 30 of the largest cities in the world by population\n\n30 of the largest cities in the world by population\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 30 largest cities in the world by population, we have considered the cities with a population of 500,000 or above. For that, we consulted the 19th Annual Demographia World Urban Areas, which was released in August 2023, for the latest population data for each country. We then arranged the most populated cities in the world in order of their population, ranking the top 30 in ascending order of their population count. Note that the report measured the populations in urban areas of the largest cities instead of measuring by the official city limits or metropolitan statistical areas.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best growth ETFs to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n“I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel’s semiconductor “fabs” in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.”\n\n10. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 27: 94.08%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 10th on our list of the best growth ETFs.

(NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n8.

With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about CNBC's Alpha Stock Survey according to which a “majority” of investors believe the market is headed for a pullback. Cramer is not at all worried about a possible decline in the market.\n\n\"Hallelujah about that survey,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said that the S&P 500 is up 10% in the first three months of 2024, registering the best quarter since 2019. This makes Cramer believe that the market is indeed heading for a pullback. But he said we should “welcome it, not fear it.”\n\nJim Cramer \"Welcomes\" Market Sell-Offs\n\nJim Cramer said that sell-offs are “inevitable.” He said even though we don’t know when they will hit, they are always expected and we should take them as buying opportunities. Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% “beatdown” every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year. Lynch said the stock market follows corporate earnings and as a result made almost accurate predictions about the Dow Jones growing at about 8% per year.\n\nCramer Thinks Market's \"Breadth Problem\" is Solved\n\nJim Cramer also said that anyone who still “insists” that this market is just about major tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other Mag. 7 stocks, they should rethink since he believes there are “so many winners” in the market that “it’s insane.” Cramer believes the market no longer has the “breadth” problem because returns are expanding across the board, sometimes at the “expense” of mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer thinks that it’s of no use to stay fixated on the Federal Reserve for now, with all indications saying the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates. Cramer wants investors to instead focus on earnings and the performance of individual companies. Cramer said we haven’t seen mass rounds of layoffs that many in the “hard landing” camp were expecting. He said we are prepared to see another hot jobs report, but if it comes softer-than-expected, we will go into the next earnings season with a “pleasant backdrop.” Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few days and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors to buy.

Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.04, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 48.1% year over year to $276.27 million, beating estimates by $17.96 million.\n\n9. Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nJim Cramer thinks Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) is a “great company to buy here.” Cramer said that this mineral company is a “terrific\" and \"really good\" idea.\n\nOver the past one year Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) shares have gained about 4% over the past one year.\n\nEarlier this month, the stock was downgraded by Liberum to Hold from Buy amid softening demand and China-related concerns.\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds had stakes in Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR).\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In addition to Diamondback Energy, we also initiated positions in Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) and HCA Healthcare in Q4. Coherent supplies engineered materials and devices to semiconductor equipment companies, data center and telecom companies, and it also produces lasers for industrial applications. The company has a long history of successfully innovating in these areas and is well-positioned to benefit from demand for advanced transceivers as artificial intelligence (AI) investments increase. As near-term cyclical headwinds have weighed on the share price, we capitalized on what we view as an attractive price relative to our estimate of intrinsic value to initiate a position.”\n\n7. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nWhen asked about Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), Cramer said that it’s making money and since the stock has run a lot, investors should buy some of it now and then wait for a pullback before buying more.\n\nPure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG) shares have gained 50% year to date through March 29.\n\nDuring its earnings call last month, the company talked about shareholder returns and guidance:\n\n\"We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY ’25. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY ’25, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.\n\nTo help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY ’25 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY ’24. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY ’25 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY ’25 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY ’24 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at 20 countries that receive the most foreign direct investment. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nAn Analysis of the World’s Foreign Investment\n\nThe global investment landscape was gloomy in 2022, mainly due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, turbulence in financial markets, and climate change causing investment uncertainty around the globe. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) suffered due to economic volatility but remained more resilient than expected. According to IMF’s World Investment Report 2023, the global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022 after declining 12 percentage points from the previous year. Despite the decline, investment inflows to the developing countries increased marginally; however, growth was concentrated in a few emerging economies. On the other hand, the FDI to the least developed countries declined, with FDI in 46 least developed countries falling to $22 billion after a decrease of 16%. Investors ended the year by announcing new industrial and infrastructural projects. To read more about investments, you can look at 12 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the US and 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.\n\nThe greenfield investment trends presented a bright spot for the international investment landscape, with the number of new projects increasing by 15% for 2022 and in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The FDI and the number of new greenfield projects also increased in developing countries. The FDI in developing countries increased by 4%, reaching $916 billion. Meanwhile, the number of new greenfield project announcements witnessed a 37% increase, thereby signaling a positive indication for investment prospects in industry and infrastructure.\n\nMoving forward, foreign direct investment is expected to increase modestly in 2024. On January 17, Reuters reported that the United Nations trade body was positive about global FDI rising modestly in 2024. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the projections for inflation and the cost of borrowing in the major markets indicate stabilization to attract international investment deals, thereby increasing global FDI in 2024. The organization, however, stressed that the geopolitical risks and high debt levels in some countries could hinder the prospects of FDI. In 2023, the foreign direct investment amounted to approximately $1.37 trillion, a marginal increase of 3% from the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Country that Attracts the Most FDI: The United States\n\nThe United States is one of the largest hosts of foreign direct investment and has announced several greenfield projects and international infrastructural and industrial deals. Some of the top companies in the US market that are driving economic growth include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Schools in some of Canada’s largest cities have joined the legal fight against social media companies with lawsuits claiming Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and others are harming children’s mental health and learning.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla’s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Bankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX Collapse Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians London Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions UBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate Finance\n\nSchool districts in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel Region filed separate legal actions Wednesday seeking a total of about C$4.5 billion ($3.3 billion) in damages.\n\nThe suits against Meta, TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. and Snapchat parent Snap Inc. claim the companies deliberately targeted children with products designed to create compulsive behavior — causing disruption in the classroom and making kids more vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation.\n\n“Endemic social media use is causing an unprecedented youth mental health crisis,” the Toronto District School Board said in a complaint filed in Ontario’s Superior Court. The companies “capitalized on their knowledge that the developing child brain is particularly vulnerable and prone to manipulation by their social media products,” the district said.\n\nSimilar claims have been made by hundreds of US school districts, who are demanding social media companies pay for the cost of addiction to their platforms.\n\nNew York City sued the same companies in February, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Meta was sued by the attorneys general of more than 30 states in October. A month later, a judge in Oakland, California, ordered Meta, Google, TikTok and Snap to face hundreds of suits blaming them for hooking young people on their platforms.\n\nRead More: NYC Sues Social Media Platforms Over Teen Mental Health\n\nSpokespeople for Meta and Bytedance didn’t immediately reply to emails requesting comment on the Canadian suits. Tonya Johnson, a spokesperson for Snap, said its platform works differently than some of the others.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Snapchat opens directly to a camera – rather than a feed of content – and has no traditional public likes or comments,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.”\n\nAccording to the Canadian school boards, about half of Ontario students aren’t getting enough sleep in part because they’re hooked on the platforms, and psychological distress and body dysmorphia are commonplace. That’s forced the schools to spend millions on hiring social workers, youth counselors and other staff.\n\nIn its claim, the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board said it’s frequently the target of anonymous social media accounts “that target either students and/or staff with false allegations, hateful and/or derogatory content” that companies often fail to remove. Anonymous accounts are also the cause of more frequent bomb and shooting threats directed at schools, as well as vandalism that’s fueled by viral TikTok challenges, the board said.\n\nPeel Region is a suburban part of greater Toronto that includes the city of Mississauga.\n\nThe case is Toronto District School Board v.

        "title": "13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 high growth value stocks to invest in according to Seth Klarman. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and an introduction to Klarman's investing history, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman.\n\nOne of the more well known investment strategies on Wall Street, which has also seen some of the most professional investors attest to its success is value investing. When compared to today's high frequency trading and quantitative model based stock market trading environment, value investment is a classical approach that evaluates whether a firm's underlying fundamentals and business models can cause share price appreciation in the future.\n\nTwo of the most well known value investors of our time are Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of the Buapost Group. Buffett's Berkshire is one of the biggest investment holding companies in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that the combined value of its 13F investments as of December 2023 end was a whopping $347 billion. As part of our regular coverage of hedge fund investments, Insider Monkey also analyzed Berkshire's Q4 2023 investment portfolio as part of our coverage of Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 12 Stock Picks. You can take a look at the portfolio by clicking on the link, but the top three picks were American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAnother follower of value investing is Seth Klarman. His hedge fund had $4.5 in Q4 2023 holdings, and some of the biggest positions were technology companies such as Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). So what is value investing? Well, the key principle of this strategy is determining the fair value of stock and comparing it with the market price through a metric called the margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the fair value and the market price, and the greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels in betting their money on an equity.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like we have done with Buffett's investments, we also took a look at Klarman's value stock picks. The latest such coverage was 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman), and the top three stocks in this list were Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). Since it's March 2024, it's important to see how well these stocks have performed over the past six months since they were disclosed by Baupost for Q3 2023. Well, the three stocks' share price performance over the past six months has been 27.73%, 27%, and 26%. Interestingly, all three of Klarman's top value stock picks in Q3 are up by 26% or 27%, despite the fact that these are relatively stable companies with few catchy products like NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPU.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the high growth value stock picks of Seth Klarman, Warren Buffett's latest letter to Berkshire shareholders also features some hidden gems for value investing. In his letter, Buffett shares:\n\nSpeed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school.\n\nThese seizures are the perfect opportunity for value investing since they can open up large differentials between the fair value and the market price. Buffett's long history of trading has also seen him capitalize on such seizures early in his career, with perhaps the most notable being his trifles with the shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at Seth Klarman's top high growth value stocks. A couple of notable names are Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman\n\nSeth Klarman of Baupost Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Seth Klarman's high growth value stocks, we ranked all stocks in Baupost Group's Q4 2023 investment portfolio by their 3-year average revenue growth rate (5-year if the 3-year estimate was in the red) and picked the top stocks. The revenue growth data was sourced from Morningstar Financial.\n\nFor these high growth value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman\n\n13. Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 35\n\nAverage 3-Year Revenue Growth Rate:  0.69%\n\nBaupost Group's Q4 2023 Stake: $\n\nHerbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is an American weight management, sports, and nutrition products provider. The average share price target of $12.80 prices in a hefty double digit percentage upside to the shares after the February 2024 Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)  share price drop in the wake of the firm's latest earnings report that saw it miss estimates.\n\nInsider Monkey dug through 933 hedge funds for their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings and found that 35 had invested in the company. Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)'s biggest hedge fund investor is William Duhamel's Route One Investment Company as it owns $157 million worth of shares.\n\nAlong with Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 20 best stocks to buy right now according to financial media. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\n\nThe United States economy has been hit hard by inflation concerns in the past two years, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates in a bid to curb surging prices. Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\n\nCoupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\n\nDespite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy. Benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have rocketed since the start of the new year. The former is up nearly 9% year-to-date and the latter has grown by more than 10%. Key stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also surging, the first two registering returns of 10.3% and 92% since the turn of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA prominent theme for growth this year is artificial intelligence. Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently highlighted the steps that the firm was taking to emerge as a leader in this space. During the fourth quarter earnings call, Huang called the present AI boom an inflection point that had triggered a sense of urgency at the enterprise level to develop strategies in the AI world. He cautioned, however, that the AI supercomputer infrastructure and model algorithms remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\n\n“I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software, or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and others on the way.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 20 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nBest Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\n20.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions. On February 14, investment advisory Piper Sandler upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised the price target to $63 from $56.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 79 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Silver Beech Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Citigroup (“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.\n\nAs a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.\n\nCiti’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n14. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)operates as a diversified software company worldwide. On January 2, investment advisory Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and raised the price target to $705 from $650.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 4.5 million shares worth more than $2.7 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payments technology firm. On January 27, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and raised the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $26.5 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 167 in the preceding quarter worth $24.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.\n\nPeople carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they’ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren’t going to get paid…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 83\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides travel and restaurant online reservation and related services worldwide. On February 26, investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and raised the price target to $4,100 from $3,677.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), compared to 81 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor firm. On March 7, investment advisory Mizuho maintained a Buy rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and raised the price target to $235 from $200.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 111\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:PFE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.”\n\n8. Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Alphabet Inc.

After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "title": "Zscaler Is Attractively Valued Amid Growing Digital Reliance",
        "content": "Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has one of the highest growth rates in its industry, based on my analysis of dominant peers. As such, I consider it a significant investment in artificieal intelligecne-integrated cybersecurity, with a particular moat in how it protects cloud operations. However, fast-changing digital landscapes, as they relate to the increased abilities of AI, could pose significant risks for shareholders. This needs to be monitored carefully.\n\nOverview of operations\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.\n\nFounded in 2007, the company describes itself as the world's largest any-to-any security cloud platform. Its most valuable operational asset at this time is the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which is a cybersecurity suite that operates under the fundamental tenet of trusting no one and verifying everything. This model treats all users and devices as potential threats, whether they are inside or outside of a network. The platform is cloud-native, meaning it is built and run on the cloud, which facilitates better scalability, performance and security.\n\nI believe this technology is particularly important at a time when work environments are becoming increasingly hybridized, with some organizations opting for fully remote working conditions. Increased cybersecurity as a result of the high load of digital transactions of often sensitive data requires advanced systems of protection against data extraction, malware and other corruption of digital workflows.\n\nZscaler has countless technology partners, including Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Slack (WORK). For example, with Microsoft, Szcaler is integrated into Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender. With Amazon Web Services, the integration of Zscaler improves the security of digital transformation, most significantly for organizations leveraging its cloud infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition\n\nOf Zscaler's competitors, and there are many, a few notable ones stand out to me as being potentially the biggest threats:\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW): I consider it to be the most significant competitor as the company has a wide range of security solutions, including advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings. Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO): The most well-financed peer, the company has an extensive range of security products, such as firewalls, VPNs and advanced malware protection. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT): The company covers everything from firewalls to secure SD-WAN, which manages traffic across wide area networks for higher efficiency.\n\nIt is useful for us to put these four peers into proper perspective based on some of the core financial metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet IPO 2018 2012 1990 2009 Market Cap $29.22 B $92.71 B $201.53 B $52.1 B Equity-to-Asset 0.24 0.24 0.46 -0.06 Net Margin -7.32% 30.24% 23.49% 21.64% 3Y Rev Growth Rate 49.6% 19.8% 6.2% 29.6% FWD PE Ratio 82 56 13.4 40\n\nIt is quite evident to me that Zscaler has particular appeal compared to some of the newer players, namely Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, as it shows higher growth. I believe, as is the case with most excellent companies that last over the long term, it will manage to stabilize its profitability. This is already somewhat evident in that its median net margin over the past 10 years is -26.69%, but, over time, it has reined this in to -7.32%.\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks looks like a compelling alternative investment, Zscaler is more attractive by and large, in my opinion. Palo Alto Networks has a strong acquisition strategy, including CloudGenix in 2020 and Twistlock in 2019, and a diverse product portfolio, including its Prisma cloud and Cortex AI security platform. But Zscaler's portfolio looks stronger and it has also made multiple high-status acquisitions, bolstering its five key areas of operation that act as a simple framework for enterprise partnerships. Among these are:\n\nZscaler Internet Access: Efficient in secure internet and SaaS application access, replacing traditional VPN and firewall technology. Zscaler Private Access: Access to private applications securely, without a VPN, without bringing users onto the internet. Zscaler Cloud Protection: Provides security for public cloud environments. Zscaler Digital Experience: A comprehensive monitoring solution that ensures optimal user experience of Zscaler tools while also optimizing security.\n\nIn short, Zscaler offers a one-point solution with some of the most advanced technology on the market, which I think outperforms Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and Fortinet operationally in many areas, specifically as it relates to cloud security and simplicity in these operations.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nZscaler's growth is hinged on the widely anticipated expansion of the broader digital services market, particularly the managed services market, which includes managed data centers, security, network and infrastructure services. Mordor Intelligence estimates this will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029. It attributes factors such as an increasing shift to hybrid IT, improved cost and operational efficiency demand and rising IT complexity as core drivers of this market growth. My own opinion is that the market as it relates to Zscaler will grow faster than this, even more so than Mordor's estimate of an 11.44% CAGR for the cybersecurity market from 2024 to 2029. My own estimate is around a 15% CAGR over the next decade, as my belief is the adoption of cloud services, hybrid and remote working and demand for advanced digital services and associated security will increase exponentially as AI proliferates the mainstream more readily, driving new business models that are more operationally digital due to cost-effectiveness, a higher amount of self-employed and independent contractors and a lower reliance on human labor in general as functions become more reliably automated.\n\nThis is a very interesting time to be in the job market, as I believe we are going to see faster change than we ever have in history, and people will have to be quick to react to shifting labor demands. That being said, one constant seems to ring true, which is that most, if not all, of these labor demands will be significantly dependent on digital workflows and associated data protection and security, which will be highly beneficial for companies like Zscaler.\n\nValuation\n\nSuccessfully valuing Zscaler based on earnings is difficult because of how early on it is in its development. As this is the case, I have opted to analyzes its price-to-free cash flow ratio relative to peers instead. I have also looked at the company's price-to-operating cash flow ratio against peers for the same reason. First of all, consider each of the four peers compared based on the two valuation metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet P/FCF 57 34.5 15 31 P/OCF 44 33 14 28\n\nZscaler is quite clearly the highest valued of the four, but investors should consider that its valuation has come down considerably in the last few years. Its median price-to-free cash flow ratio over the past 10 years is 221.75, indicating a 74.10% discount from the historical valuation. Additionally, its price-to-operating cash flow median over the past 10 years is 132.90, indicating a 66.60% discount from the historical valuation.\n\nConsidering analysts expect, on consensus, an earnings per share without non-recurring items CAGR of 31.17% over the next three years, I believe the present valuation shows a significantly strong price and an attractive entry point despite trading at a premium to the three peers. We must remember that Palo Alto Networks has a much lower forecasted CAGR over the next three years of 17.05%, hence the lower premium in the valuation attributed by the market.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is evidently a risk that Zscaler will be outcompeted by other cybersecurity companies that develop, and it appears that there is not a concentrated monopoly in cybersecurity at this time. As such, there is, in some sense, an arms race toward that monopoly in AI-led cybersecurity, similar to how Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have a duopoly in software and hardware. Zscaler investors should watch the market carefully, as there may come a time in the not-too-distant future when it makes sense to sell the stake for another provider if it becomes clear the balance of power has begun to shift.\n\nAdditionally, along similar lines, as AI becomes more powerful and we reach unprecedented capabilities, it is quite possible the cybersecurity and digital landscapes shift considerably. What is now cutting-edge, the cloud, could in the future become outdated and Zscaler has an enormous task at hand in keeping up to date with the rapid shifts that are likely to happen in the AI and associated cybersecurity industries. The company has a large ecosystem with partners and connections in the industry that provide it with some moat in this regard in terms of operational collaboration and financing capabilities, but investors must be aware of the risk of rapid change.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom my research, I believe Zscaler to be one of the best investments in cybersecurity currently, but the markets are shifting quickly. Nonetheless, I believe now is a prudent time to consider the stock due to the favorable valuation and high growth expected by analysts. My research into market drivers bodes very well for the company's long-term future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 70% of His $10 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Stocks",
        "content": "For individual investors, it can pay to follow what the professionals are doing. Specifically, if you are a buy-and-hold investor you can find ideas from like-minded investing legends. One investor to follow closely is Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management. The billionaire investor runs a $10 billion portfolio for outside investors, owning positions in just seven stocks that he and the team have held for many years.\n\nHere are four stocks that make up a whopping 70% of Ackman's concentrated stock portfolio. CMG Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\n1. Successfully betting on a Chipotle rebound\n\nAckman's second-largest position is Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Pershing Square bought the stock after the restaurant chain began to struggle in 2016 after an outbreak of food-borne illness at some of its locations. It helped the company steer a turnaround by bringing in new management and fixing its quality control issues.\n\nSince the middle of 2016, Chipotle's stock has returned some 632% for shareholders. Operating income has grown even faster, up 963% over this time period as the company regained store traffic and significantly improved its margins. At the end of 2023, it had just under 3,500 stores in North America. While the company is quite large today, management thinks there is room to double its store count to 7,000 locations in North America alone, with no consideration for any international expansion.\n\nAdd on solid same-store sales growth, and Chipotle looks primed to continue growing earnings for many years into the future. At just over 18% of his portfolio, this has been a huge winner for Ackman and could continue to be in the future. QSR EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\n2. More restaurant exposure\n\nAt 17.6% of the portfolio, another large position for Pershing Square is Restaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR). Like Chipotle, this is a bet on quick-service restaurant chains, with the company owning four brands: Firehouse Subs, Popeyes, Burger King, and Tim Hortons. It has also been one of the longer-term holdings for Pershing Square, with the first purchase of the stock coming all the way back in 2014.\n\nStory continues\n\nRestaurant Brands' stock performance has not been as strong as Chipotle's, but it has still done well for Pershing Square. Shares are up 194% since 2014, with earnings per share (EPS) up 654% as well. It owns four distinct brands that give it diversified exposure to the entire restaurant sector with over 30,000 restaurants spread around the globe. For investors looking for durable stocks with low downside over the long term, Restaurant Brands International looks like a great choice. It is hard to imagine there not being Burger King and Tim Hortons locations 10 or 20 years from now. HLT Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\n3. A take rate on global travel\n\nAt 16.2% of the Pershing Square stock portfolio, Ackman has made another play on a consumer brand with Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT). The investment company bought the stock back in 2018, making a bet on the growth of global travel. Hilton Worldwide owns its namesake Hilton brand but also a variety of other hotel brands like the Waldorf Astoria, Embassy Suites, and DoubleTree.\n\nImportantly, Hilton Worldwide doesn't actually own the hotel real estate, but licenses its brands to hotel operators. In exchange, Hilton receives a cut of all sales, which hotel owners are willing to do because the Hilton brand allows them to offer higher room rates compared to if they were an independent operator.\n\nHilton's earnings haven't grown much since 2018 due to the pandemic, with operating income up 77% and revenue only up 20%. But it looks like a recovery may be on the way, with spending on travel fully rebounding in most markets. With its exposure to global travel, Hilton is poised to benefit from this recovery, and its business model is hedged to inflation. It is unsurprising then to see the stock make up a large portion of Ackman's portfolio in early 2024. This is a great business with a long-standing global brand.\n\n4. Don't forget the largest holding: Alphabet\n\nAckman's largest holding, and his most recent purchase, is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Pershing Square bought shares of the parent company of Google Search and YouTube in early 2023. It is now close to 19% of the stock portfolio.\n\nAckman likely purchased Alphabet because of its falling valuation at the beginning of last year due to fears it was losing the new race in artificial intelligence (AI) to competitors like Microsoft. These fears proved to be unwarranted, with Alphabet continuing its earnings growth through 2023. The company's operating earnings hit an all-time high of $84.3 billion in 2023, leading the stock to soar 71% since the beginning of last year.\n\nAlphabet looks like a quintessential Pershing Square bet. It is a diversified holding company with long-standing global brands, and the hedge fund manager decided to strike and make it a large position when its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) came down to around 15 early last year.\n\nInvestors can learn a lot from Pershing Square and Ackman. He makes concentrated bets on stocks with strong brands trading at reasonable valuations. Then, he holds his positions for many years and lets his winners run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Bets $150 Billion on Data Centers Required for AI Boom",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to spend almost $150 billion in the coming 15 years on data centers, giving the cloud-computing giant the firepower to handle an expected explosion in demand for artificial intelligence applications and other digital services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians China Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest Banks Japan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990\n\nThe spending spree is a show of force as the company looks to maintain its grip on the cloud services market, where it holds about twice the share of No. 2 player Microsoft Corp. Sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to a record low last year as business customers cut costs and delayed modernization projects. Now spending is starting to pick up again, and Amazon is keen to secure land and electricity for its power-hungry facilities.\n\n“We’re expanding capacity quite significantly,” said Kevin Miller, an AWS vice president who oversees the company’s data centers. “I think that just gives us the ability to get closer to customers.”\n\nOver the past two years, according to a Bloomberg tally, Amazon has committed to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.\n\nAmazon’s planned outlay on server farms dwarfs the public commitments from Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different costs in their estimates.\n\nAmid broader cost-cutting at Amazon, AWS’s capital expenditures on data centers shrank 2% in 2023—for the first time—even as Microsoft boosted its own spending by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell’Oro Group. But Amazon’s chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of Amazon’s data center expansion is geared toward meeting a rise in demand for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft, close partner OpenAI and Google are widely seen as leaders in commercializing software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own tools to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related revenue.\n\nAWS put its first server farms in Virginia, on the fringes of metropolitan Washington. Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.\n\nAmazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it’s getting harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion Energy Inc., which powers Virginia’s data center alley, couldn’t keep up, pausing connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven primarily by data centers.\n\nIn Oregon, electricity use by Amazon server farms exceeds the local utility’s share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year.\n\n“There’s a lot more vetting that is occurring upfront and detailed planning that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project is because there’s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,” said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nSo Amazon is getting creative.\n\nIn February, the company said it would spend about $10 billion on two data center campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history, AWS’s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta.\n\nEarlier this month, the operator of a 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania said AWS had agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to the facility.\n\nIn Round Rock, Texas, AWS recently won zoning approval to build a data center and electrical substation next to a delivery depot on a slice of a former ranch the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds, it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece of land.\n\n“Right now it’s just a mad scramble for any place that has power any time soon,” said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager and Seattle-based investor who tracks cloud company spending.\n\nEven as it ramps up, Amazon and other companies are encountering growing opposition to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents complain about server farms’ incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling facilities’ encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers come online—whether they are built by Amazon or not.\n\nRenewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate for decades.\n\n“Companies like Amazon are going to have to use their buying power to actually force the utilities to change their behavior,” said Daniel Tait, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that backs renewables. “Not only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.”\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has been the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity by 2025. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid.\n\nAmazon data center chief Miller said the company was continuing to evaluate clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work with utilities and find a way to “match our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free power.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Alphabet and Amazon Stocks Surge to All-Time Highs: Buy These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stars Now or Regret It Later",
        "content": "The inflation panic took the wind out of Wall Street's sails, especially where it crosses Silicon Valley in a proverbial sense. The stocks of tech titans Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) took a beating as investors backed away from growth-oriented ideas.\n\nAmazon's shares fell as much as 57% from its pre-panic record price. The Google parent's price drop stopped at 46%. Only now, more than two years later, are they sniffing at fresh all-time highs again.\n\nI don't think this is the last hurrah from two tired comeback stories. Instead, I see Alphabet and Amazon as the two best buys in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group right now, with tremendous returns on the long-term horizon. You should consider grabbing some of these top-quality stocks while they're still relatively affordable.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet's big AI bets\n\nFirst, I'd like to point out that Amazon and Alphabet have plenty of irons in the artificial intelligence (AI) fires. They may not be as deeply and directly involved in the frenzy for generative AI and large language models (LLMs) as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), but you're looking at two of the leading providers of cloud-based computing services.\n\nGoogle Cloud and Amazon Web Services play significant roles in the back-end of everyone else's AI ambitions, crunching the required numbers in their global data center networks. They also offer their own AI tools, led by the ChatGPT-like Google Gemini platform and the Amazon Lex chatbot. You may not be familiar with Lex, but it's basically the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa, made available for any developer in need of a conversationsl natural language system. How committed to AI innovation are Google and Amazon? Well, both companies use the latest and greatest AI acceleration hardware from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), but that's not all. The Cloud TPU and AWS Inferentia chips are proprietary AI accelerator chips designed by Google's and Amazon's own engineers, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd they are heavy users of AI tools in their daily work, too. You'll find AI behind the scenes of many consumer-facing services, from travel routes in Google Maps and Amazon's automated warehouse management to YouTube's video recommendation engine and Alexa's helpful chatter.\n\nThese stocks aren't expensive, even at all-time highs\n\nSo I'm not saying that Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks should have tripled over the last year, like Nvidia. But their rebound from the rock-bottom pricing of the inflation crisis was slower than they deserved. I can't believe it took this long just to get back to prices last seen in November 2021.\n\nAnd they're priced to keep on moving, too.\n\nShares of Amazon are changing hands at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.2 times sales. Alphabet's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) clocks in at 6.1. In a world where Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) commands a double-digit P/S ratio and Nvidia has soared to 39 times sales, these figures strike me as big market-maker mistakes.\n\nWhy Amazon and Alphabet aren't skyrocketing (yet)\n\nOf course, Wall Street had its reasons to keep Alphabet and Amazon under wraps while most of their \"Magnificent Seven\" peers soared.\n\nThe digital advertising market fell into a deep recession in 2022. Inflationary pressure is no joke -- consumers held on to their wallets with both hands while everybody's cost of doing business rose. That's not a great environment for launching extravagant marketing campaigns. The economic pressure has subsided in recent quarters but I'm still not talking about a full-fledged return to optimal health. So Alphabet's ad-based business has seen slower growth than usual, and the stock arguably deserves a bit of a discount under these circumstances.\n\nThe same market reality also held back Amazon's retail sales. The inflation crunch started knee-deep in the all-important holiday season of 2021. The e-commerce veteran had to cut costs, slow down its spending on the delivery infrastructure, and absorb two years of low-grade growth. Again, I see why risk-averse investors would stay away from Amazon against that backdrop.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet should soar soon enough\n\nAmazon and Alphabet, with their undaunted investments in AI and cloud computing, are not just surviving the storm but blazing their own paths through it.\n\nThe key takeaway? Investors should try to tune out the market noise and focus on the fundamentals. These tech giants look undervalued today, but that doesn't mean you should consider selling your shares to find better alternatives. On the contrary, the modest pricing is an open invitation to grab fistfuls of Alphabet and Amazon shares at a reasonable price.\n\nIn the end, no downturn lasts forever. This pair of \"Magnificent Seven\" beasts is prepared to truly soar when the American and global economy gets back on its feet.\n\nThe companies that drive tomorrow's innovations will deliver the most enduring returns.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 States with the Largest Homeless Populations Per Capita.\n\nThe Homelessness Crisis in the US\n\nThe United States faces a significant challenge with homelessness, with the number of homeless individuals surging to record levels. The homeless population in the US is steadily rising, largely due to rising housing costs and a shortage of affordable housing.\n\nOn March 22, Reuters reported that state and local governments in the US are pursuing different strategies to tackle the country’s homelessness crisis. Some are aiming to raise more funds to address the issue, while others are empowering authorities to rid public places of its visible signs. In California, a ballot measure emphasizing funding for homeless services was narrowly passed by voters. Meanwhile, in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis took a different approach by signing legislation that prohibits camping on city sidewalks, parks, and other public areas. Similarly, Kentucky's legislature has moved forward with an anti-crime bill that includes a similar camping ban while also expanding citizens' \"stand your ground\" rights against trespassers. According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the homeless population in the US increased by 12% year-over-year to reach a record high of 653,000 in 2023. To achieve a permanent solution to homelessness, experts and advocates emphasize the critical role of increasing the availability of affordable housing options.\n\nCorporate Efforts to Combat the Homelessness Crisis\n\nThe nationwide efforts underscore the escalating severity of the homelessness crisis. The sight of people living in tents on sidewalks is becoming increasingly common in many US cities and towns, pushing politicians and policymakers to take action. Additionally, major corporations have pledged to contribute towards resolving the housing crisis and promoting affordable housing solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the biggest corporations that have stepped up include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google. These three giant tech corporations are actively engaged in combating homelessness in the US by contributing funds and resources to address this pressing issue. You can also read about the largest companies in the world by market cap in 2024.\n\nIn 2019, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google announced a $1 billion initiative focused on enhancing affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, aiming to facilitate the construction of a minimum of 20,000 homes catering to various income levels across the region. The tech giant's strategy involves repurposing its land for housing projects targeting middle and low-income families. Furthermore, Google established a $250 million affordable housing investment fund to expedite the development and preservation of affordable housing units in the Bay Area. By providing early and reliable investment capital, Google seeks to accelerate the creation of a substantial amount of housing in a timely and sustainable manner. As of June 2023, Google has allocated $133 million toward the development of affordable housing projects throughout the Bay Area. Additionally, Google has invested in Factory_OS, a modular housing company, to expand its production capacity by constructing a second factory, with the aim of generating tens of thousands of homes over the next decade. This investment has already supported Factory_OS in delivering over 2,000 modular homes.\n\nIn January 2019, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also announced its Affordable Housing Initiative which currently stands at $750 million. This initiative aims to promote affordable housing solutions in the Puget Sound region through strategic loans and grants. The company continues to engage with local authorities, housing developers, and financial agencies to identify the best opportunities to construct more affordable housing in the region. As of 2022, three years after the launch of its Affordable Housing Initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that it has directed $583 million towards preserving and constructing around 9,200 housing units in the Puget Sound region, which includes projects amounting to $73 million in affordable housing investments and grants.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks high among the companies with the most employees in the US. In January 2021, Amazon launched its $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes. This initiative aims to assist individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in three key areas where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates: the Puget Sound region in Washington State, Arlington in Virginia, and Nashville in Tennessee. Additionally, Amazon has allocated $100 million in cash and donations to Mary’s Place, a nonprofit partner, to construct the largest family shelter in Washington state within an Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) office building at the Puget Sound headquarters.\n\nNow that we have looked at corporate actions against the housing crisis in the US, let’s shift our focus to the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. 20 States with the Largest Homeless Populations Per Capita\n\nCopyright: zhukovsky / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article, we have listed the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. To calculate the homeless rate by state per capita, we first consulted The 2023 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) by The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Countries with the Highest Number of Road Traffic Deaths.\n\nAre Self Driving Vehicles Really That Safe?\n\nAccording to a report by the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, autonomous vehicles have driven more than 44 million miles on public roads in the United States. By law, the AV industry must report any accidents to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The industry has been reporting accidents to the administration body for two years, and so far only one serious injury has been reported. Compared to these statistics, almost 43,000 human lives were lost in 2022, due to reckless driving by human drivers.\n\nAccording to a report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the US reported 12.9 deaths per 100,000 people, and 1.37 traffic deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Rhode Island reported 5.7 and Mississippi reported 26.2 traffic deaths per 100,000 people. On the other hand, Massachusetts reported 0.71 and South Carolina reported 2.08 traffic deaths per 100 million miles traveled. 49% of the deaths in Rhode Island were of car owners, and 35% of deaths in Hawaii were of motorcyclists. You can also take a look at the countries with the most dangerous roads in the world.\n\nChina Making Strides to Improve Smart Transportation\n\nOn January 17, 2023, CGTN reported China's position on smart roads. China is home to a 157-kilometer highway expanding across Chengdu to Yibin, which is categorized as China's first \"total factor\" smart highway. The government has placed a smart pillar every 800 meters that provides road information to cars and drivers using radars and cameras.\n\nOn July 19, 2023, CGTN reported that China exported the world's first hydrogen-powered smart tram to Malaysia. The tram was produced in Zhuzhou by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Research Institute Co. The tram enjoys a long driving range, supports energy saving, and has a shorter refueling time.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Reuters reported on China's commitment to push innovation in the self-driving industry by 2025. The country formed the Innovation Consortia to enable firms to learn from each other and celebrate technological advancements. According to the report, by the first half of 2023, 42% of passenger vehicles in China had already achieved level 2 of automated driving. The category supports self-driving functions, however, the driver must be ready to take over in case of emergency. The country is aiming to achieve level 3 of automation.\n\nTop Autonomous Vehicle Companies\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo, General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) subsidiary Cruise, and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) are among the leading autonomous vehicle producers in the world. Let's discuss recent updates and offerings from these companies.  You can also take a look at best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.\n\nWaymo LLC, formerly known as Google Self-Driving Car Project, is owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company is an autonomous driving technology company and is also home to Waymo One, the world's first autonomous ride-hailing service. It is functional in several cities across the United States. The cars are fully powered by renewable energy. On March 13, the company announced that it is set to launch Waymo One across two more cities in 2024. Waymo is currently testing the functionality of autonomous driving across 43 square miles of the city. During the testing phase, the company provides rides to its employees. As for Los Angeles, Waymo will first offer its services across 63 square miles of the city and will scale operations as time passes.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a leading automotive company based in the United States. Cruise, a product of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is a big name in the autonomous vehicles market. According to a media report by Reuters, published on February 3, driverless vehicles in California drove 3.3 million miles in 2023. Of them, Waymo and Cruise accounted for 36% and 63% of the total miles driven. Cruise has recently been under the water for an accident. On November 8, 2023, Reuters reported that Cruise recalled 950 driverless vehicles from across the United States after one of its autonomous cars dragged a pedestrian in a crash. The cars were recalled because the company suspected that the autonomous driving software would respond differently to the crash resulting in more crashes. The company lost over $700 million in the third quarter, ultimately slashing its value by half. The company is now aiming to get back on the roads of the United States soon by trying to win back the trust of users. On March 25, Cruise published a statement regarding the incident that happened back in October 2023. The company announced that since the incident it has been establishing systems to improve safety. With improved efforts, the company aims to rebuild trust among stakeholders and customers.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a leading technology company based in China. 2023 has been huge for the company in the domain of autonomous vehicles. On March 17, 2023, the company received a permit to provide complete driverless ride-hailing services in Beijing, China. Previously, the company was not allowed to operate without human supervision. Later that year, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) became the first company in China to launch driverless airport rides in Wuhan.

        "title": "Apple’s first quarter has felt more like an entire (bad) year",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a “difficult” period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.\n\nThe company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it’s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it’ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it’s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nAll of that is hurting Apple’s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.\n\nSuffice it to say, Apple’s 2024 is not going well.\n\nApple’s China problem\n\nApple’s latest headache came Tuesday, when Bloomberg, citing Chinese government data, reported that iPhone shipments fell 33% year over year in the country in February.\n\nChina is Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the region accounted for $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in total revenue. That’s roughly 19% of the company’s sales.\n\nAnd this isn’t exactly out of the blue. Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone sales fell 24% year over year through the first six weeks of 2024 in the country. Overall smartphone unit sales in China declined 7% during the same period. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a parallel session the China Development Forum at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, on Sunday, March 24, 2024. (Tatan Syuflana/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple has been aggressively expanding in China for years, but a resurgent Huawei and difficult economic conditions in the country are squeezing device sales. The company isn’t just sitting idly by, though. Last week, CEO Tim Cook flew to China for the opening of the company’s latest flagship store in Shanghai. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing and was expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Apple-authorized retailers are also trying to goose sales, cutting the price of the company’s latest iPhones in the hopes that it will get consumers to start buying again. However, it might take more than lower prices to make that happen.\n\nA battle with the DOJ\n\nOutside of Apple’s China sales drama, the company is also facing its long-anticipated antitrust fight with the Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which the DOJ filed last Thursday, accuses Apple of illegally maintaining dominance over the premium smartphone market by pushing aside competing apps and devices.\n\nThe Justice Department claims that Apple imposes restrictions on app developers, makes it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms, and hinders cloud gaming and so-called super apps that allow users to access multiple smaller apps from one larger platform. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference at Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, Thursday, March 21, 2024. (Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple, however, is fighting back, saying in a statement that the suit \"threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\n\nThe DOJ is seeking to force Apple to change its business practices, which could mean giving third-party apps greater access to the company’s platforms and requiring Apple to expand compatibility with third-party device makers.\n\nThe lawsuit could also prove to be a dangerous distraction for Apple similar to how Microsoft’s antitrust battle in the 90’s stole executives’ attention away from emerging technologies like smartphones. If Microsoft hadn’t been so invested in its antitrust fight at the time, there’s a good chance it would have seen the smartphone age coming as did Apple and Google, and launched its own line of handsets.\n\nEuropean Commission calling\n\nIn addition to slowing iPhone sales in China and the DOJ’s antitrust suit, the European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission on Monday, announced that it is looking into whether Apple is in compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. European Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age, Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding the Digital Markets Act at EU headquarters in Brussels, Monday, March 25, 2024. (Virginia Mayo/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn a statement released Monday, the Commission said it is investigating Apple’s new app fee structure in the EU as well as whether it meets user choice obligations related to default apps and the ability to delete preinstalled apps.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act requires Apple to open up the iPhone to third-party app stores, enabling developers to get around the 30% and 15% fees the company charges for sales through its own App Store. While Apple said it will allow those third-party stores, the company said it will also charge developers a 50 euro cent Core Technology Fee per install per year on apps that have been installed more than 1 million times in the last 12 months.\n\nIn a statement, the EC said it is looking into whether Apple’s new fees defeat the purpose of the obligations of the Digital Markets Act.\n\nWhile Apple is certainly facing a slew of challenges, it’s far from down and out. It’s still the second-richest company in the world by market capitalization — behind Microsoft — and it’s sure to continue to sell millions of devices and services subscriptions throughout the year ahead.\n\nStill, for the foreseeable future, Apple could be in for a bumpy ride.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +8.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $286.48 billion and $318.3 billion estimates indicate +11.7% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google's advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023.

In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability.

        "title": "'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle",
        "content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): \"The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.\"\n\nBut not all legal experts agree federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone.\n\n\"My guess is [Apple] will win,\" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEven if Apple does not prevail in New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Yes I think that Apple will prevail in the end.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland, announcing the government's antitrust suit against Apple. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) — alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\n\nThe case against Apple is the widest ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\n\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government’s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products — including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps — on the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook In China last Sunday. (Wu Hao/Pool Photo via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone’s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneiner said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument \"I think they win.\"\n\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company’s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\n\"Apple does have more security, because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneiner said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\n\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneiner.\n\n\"Don’t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\n\nThe hurdles DOJ must overcome\n\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\n\"I think it’s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple’s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\n\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olsen.\n\nTo overcome those limits, Olsen said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law. Apple has a dominant share of the US smartphone market. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/file photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olsen explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\n\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\n\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\n\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that’s problematic?” Picker said.\n\nThe government’s answer is that Apple’s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products – like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\n\nA 'pretty hard case'\n\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than to harm them.\n\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega popular gaming app “Fortnite,” Epic Games. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. (Photo by Philip Pacheco/Getty Images) (Philip Pacheco via Getty Images)\n\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\n\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\n\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olsen said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olsen said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 37% of His Portfolio Invested in 2 Brilliant Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire Bill Ackman manages the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management. He achieved a total return of 212% during the five-year period that ended in February 2024, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which increased 99% during the same period. That makes him a good case study for aspiring investors.\n\nWith that in mind, Ackman had 37% of his $10.4 billion portfolio split between two companies as of the December quarter. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) accounted for 19% of his invested assets, and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) accounted for 18%. That position sizing screams high conviction.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these two brilliantly successful companies.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet reported solid results in the fourth quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 13% to $86.3 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the cloud computing segment. Meanwhile, GAAP net income soared 52% to $20.7 billion as cost control efforts led to a 300-basis-point expansion in operating margin. Investors can expect similar revenue growth in the coming quarters, though earnings growth will undoubtedly slow.\n\nAlphabet subsidiary Google has a durable competitive advantage in its ability to source data from across the internet. Specifically, the company owns 15 products that serve at least 500 million users, and six products that serve more than 2 billion users. That includes internet search engine Google Search, streaming platform YouTube, the Android mobile operating system, and the Chrome web browser.\n\nThe upshot is that Google dominates the digital advertising market because it has a deep understanding of consumer behavior that media buyers find valuable. The company accounted for 39% of digital ad spending last year, according to Statista. Google is working to strengthen its position by infusing its ad tech ecosystem with new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, including the recent addition of generative AI capabilities to Google Search.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has steadily gained share in cloud computing due to investments in product development and go-to-market capabilities. Google Cloud Platform accounted for 11% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, up one percentage point from the prior year. Google still trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin, but the recent release of Gemini could help the company gain more market share.\n\nGemini is a machine learning model that can outperform GPT-4 (the engine behind ChatGPT Plus) across a range of benchmarks, according to the company. Gemini lets Google Cloud customers build AI applications, such as conversational chatbots and intelligence search agents. Gemini also integrates with Google Workspace applications to automate tasks like drafting content in Google Docs, synthesizing data in Google Sheets, and generating images in Google Slides.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow sales by 10% annually over the next five years, but that estimate leaves upside if the company merely maintains its market share in advertising and cloud computing. I say that because digital ad spending is expected to grow at 15% annually through 2030, and cloud computing revenue is expected to grow at 14% annually during the same period.\n\nHowever, the current valuation of 6.4 times sales look reasonable even if the Wall Street consensus is correct. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying this growth stock today, but I would be much more conservative on position sizing than Bill Ackman.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle looked strong in the fourth quarter despite a challenging environment for many peers in the restaurant industry. Revenue for the fast-casual restaurant chain increased 15% to $2.5 billion, operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 14.4%, and non-GAAP net income soared 25% to $10.36 per diluted share. The driving force behind that success was strong same-store sales growth of 8.4% driven by pricing power and a 7.4% increase in foot traffic.\n\nThose numbers are truly impressive in context. The average restaurant saw same-store sales increase just 1.1% in December, while customer traffic actually declined 1.7%, according to the National Restaurant Association. That means Chipotle brought more people in the door while the average competitor lost business, something the company does on a regular basis. That is a testament to the brand authority Chipotle has cultivated through its \"food with integrity\" strategy.\n\nTo elaborate, Chipotle sources only responsibly raised meats (no hormones or antibiotics) and organically grown produce, and it uses only real ingredients (no preservatives or artificial flavors). The company is also committed to fresh ingredients, which means no freezers, no can openers, and no microwaves, according to CEO Brian Niccol. That strategy has helped Chipotle separate itself from other quick-service restaurants.\n\nUnfortunately, not every brilliant company also qualifies as a great investment. Wall Street expects Chipotle to grow earnings per share at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 65 times earnings look rather expensive. To be fair, investors that want a piece of this company should be prepared to pay a premium, but I would personally wait for a cheaper entry point before purchasing shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Could Become a Penny Stock",
        "content": "Snap (NYSE:SNAP) may be heading toward penny stock status. Back in December, I urged investors to consider exiting their positions at $15.90 due to an unjustified surge in the stock. Fast-forward to today, with Snap trading at $11.31, and my bearish outlook on Snap has only deepened. Following continuous operating losses and a lack of substantial free cash flow generation to justify its current valuation, Snap seems poised to keep deteriorating shareholder value, inevitably inching closer to penny stock status.\n\nSnap’s Growth Stalls as Peers Surge\n\nThe first factor fueling my bearish stance on Snap is its stagnant growth in a landscape where its peers thrive and deliver great results. Assuming Snap was growing rapidly, I could go easier on the company’s disastrous profitability (more on that later). However, with top-line growth having halted, I see no way for the company to come out of its current predicament.\n\nTo illustrate, Snap’s revenues came in at $4.6 billion in FY 2023, flat compared to the previous year. This result is quite underwhelming in itself because Snap’s revenue growth stagnated during a rather favorable advertising environment. In fact, many of its peers in the social media and content-sharing area recorded significantly higher revenues during the same period.\n\nFor instance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted revenue growth of 16% last year, while Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube also grew its revenues by 16% in this period. Even Pinterest, whose growth tends to underperform, grew its top line by 9% in FY 2023.\n\nThe company may highlight its platform’s ongoing user growth, with Snap’s daily active users rising to 414 million globally in Q4—marking a 10% increase. However, this narrative merely scratches the surface. Notably, this expansion is primarily attributed to a 19% surge in users from the rest-of-the-world regions (i.e., all regions outside North America and Europe). Source: SNAP’s Q4-2023 Investor Presentation\n\nThe problem is that RoW user growth has little to no value, as these users can hardly be monetized. It is actually North America and Europe that can drive ad revenue, as their users have tremendously higher purchasing power. In the meantime, Snap even lost about one million users quarter-over-quarter in North America, further dampening its user mix. Therefore, despite the seemingly growing user base, Snap’s revenue per user (ARPU) fell by 5% in Q4, partially offsetting revenue gains from user growth.\n\nStory continues Source: SNAP’s Q4-2023 Investor Presentation\n\nSnap’s quarterly reports have consistently highlighted advertisers’ hesitation to spend big on its platform relative to its competitors, likely largely due to the lack of impactful conversion metrics. Thus, given that Snap posted a decline in ARPU in a vigorous advertising environment, it’s reasonable to expect that the moment global ad spending loses its current steam in line with its cyclical fashion, Snap’s revenues could plummet from here.\n\nOperating Losses Persist & Free Cash Flow Isn’t a Good Indicator\n\nWith Snap lacking meaningful revenue growth to improve its profitability prospects, its operating losses are likely to persist. At the same, the company’s seemingly growing free cash flow model isn’t a good indicator of the stock’s prospects, as Snap’s stock-based compensation (SBC) keeps deteriorating shareholder value. Let’s take a deeper look.\n\nAs you can see below, with total costs and expenses surpassing Snap’s revenues, FY 2023 marked another year of steep operating losses, reaching $1.4 billion.\n\nSnap may defend its position in that regard by citing its “growing” free cash flow. In fact, management celebrated FY 2023 as Snap’s third consecutive year of positive free cash flow. However, Snap’s free cash flow should be highly scrutinized. Take a look at Snap’s FY 2023 statements. You will find that while free cash flow came in came in at roughly $35 million, this number includes a huge $1.3 billion in stock-based compensation expenses added back during the reconciliation process.\n\nTherefore, while it may seem that Snap “creates value” due to its positive free cash flow, the rate at which it dilutes shareholders (with FY 2023’s SBC equal to about 7% of the current market cap) more than offsets the rate at which value is created by a wide margin.\n\nIn my view, this trend appears poised to persist, steadily chipping away at shareholders’ equity per share, resulting in increasing dilution and, thus, a declining share price. This trajectory will potentially drive Snap toward penny stock territory. With no apparent catalysts for revenue growth and a persistent struggle to control expenses, the course seems irreversible.\n\nThis process could even accelerate if ARPU keeps falling, which I find increasingly likely, given the company’s lackluster performance during a favorable ad environment.\n\nIs SNAP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street seems to have mixed feelings about the stock, as SNAP features a Hold consensus rating based on nine Buys, 22 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. At $13.98 per share, the average SNAP stock price target suggests 23.6% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SNAP stock, the most accurate analyst following the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Ross Sandler from Barclays. He boasts an average return of 43.94% per rating and a 57% success rate.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I understand that suggesting Snap is headed towards penny stock territory may appear audacious. Nonetheless, from my perspective, it seems increasingly inevitable.\n\nDespite management’s attempts to highlight growing user numbers and positive free cash flow, the company faces significant hurdles. Stalled revenue growth, troubled by a decline in ARPU and persistent operating losses, paints a bleak picture.\n\nWith competitors surging and advertisers hesitant to spend their hard-earned dollars on Snap’s platform, it’s only reasonable to expect the company’s metrics to worsen further, particularly once global ad spending takes a breather, which could accelerate the erosion in shareholder value.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Pinterest (PINS) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of social commerce platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) jumped 6% in the morning session after following a Piper Sandler report that the company may be exploring a potential advertising partnership with Google in the United States. This update provides further insights regarding Pinterest's expansion strategy as it looks to better monetize more markets. Management noted during its Q4'2023 earnings call that it will \"enable ads to be served on Pinterest via Google's Ad Manager. \" Given Google's significantly bigger reach, a partnership should be accretive to Pinterest's growth narrative as it explores new markets. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $35.70, up 2.1% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Pinterest? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nPinterest's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 8 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 2 months ago, when the stock dropped 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue missing analysts' expectations, though EPS beat. Revenue guidance for the next quarter also fell below expectations.\n\nBernstein's analyst Mark Shmulik highlighted the market's concerns after the results, \"Coming out of this earnings season, it's fair to ask whether the smaller platforms (SNAP, PINS) are structurally disadvantaged and sub-scale in what increasingly looks like a winner-take-most digital ad landscape.\" This refers to the competition from bigger players such as Alphabet and Meta. On the other hand, Pinterest added new users this quarter and beat expectations for MAUs (monthly active users).\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the results were weak, given the underwhelming guidance and considering the strong results delivered by Meta earlier in the season, which raised the bar for digital ad stocks.\n\nPinterest is down 1.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $35.70 per share it is trading 13% below its 52-week high of $41.05 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Pinterest's shares at the IPO in April 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,463.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Google’s founders didn’t market test Alphabet’s name before launching the now $1.9 trillion juggernaut. Here’s the advice Steve Jobs gave Larry Page",
        "content": "Even from Google’s inception, cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin considered the company’s potential for astronomical growth. Named after “googol,” the term for the numeral 1 with 100 zeros behind it, Google, then just a search engine founded in 1998, would become as large as the internet would allow.\n\nThe company has far exceeded the parameters of just the internet. Valued at about $1.9 trillion, Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, ranks No. 1 on Fortune’s 2024 Most Innovative Companies list. Broken into three segments—Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets—Alphabet’s reach spans from Android, Chrome, YouTube, and its Bard AI chatbot under its Services umbrella, to cloud computing under its Cloud umbrella, to private equity fund CapitalG, DeepMind AI research, and Waymo under its Other Bets umbrella. Google Services makes up 90% of the company’s revenue, Fortune calculated from Alphabet’s 2023 fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nPage, the eighth-richest person in the world with a net worth of about $136 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has certainly reaped the rewards of Alphabet’s success. With stints as CEO of Google from 1997 to 2001 and 2011 to 2015, and of Alphabet until 2019, Page remains a board member and shareholder of his company, effectively controlling it alongside cofounder Brin.\n\nTuesday is Page’s 51st birthday, and while he’s another year older and wiser, it was Apple cofounder Steve Jobs who imparted some prescient wisdom about the company’s future, which now boasts the sixth-largest market capitalization in the world.\n\nPage visited Jobs toward the end of Jobs’ life in 2011 to receive some frank advice from his mentor: “The main thing I stressed was focus,” Jobs said, according to Walter Isaacson, author of Jobs’ biography. “It’s now all over the map. What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they’re dragging you down. They’re turning you into Microsoft. They’re causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“He was right,” Page told Fortune CEO Alan Murray at Fortune’s Global Forum in 2015, just days after Alphabet’s October founding. “I mean, he did fine as well.”\n\nPage did listen to his advice at first, telling employees to focus on Android products and the now-defunct Google+. But the growth of Alphabet suggested the company was poised for bigger things, and more of them.\n\nAlphabet was designed as a container for Google’s future ventures, even its more esoteric ideas such as glucose-monitoring contact lenses. While Page conceded that Jobs was correct on some level, he also believed that Alphabet’s ventures were interconnected and that energy, telecommunications, and transportation all fit under its umbrella.\n\n“I always thought it was kind of stupid if you have this big company, and you can only do, like, five things,” Page said in a 2014 fireside chat with Khosla Ventures, taking a jab at Jobs.\n\nPage and Brin were so certain of Alphabet’s name and purpose that they didn’t even market test it.\n\n“I wanted to have a name that people would be proud to work for,” Page said. “But [I] actually didn’t want it to be too catchy because the idea really wasn’t to have a consumer brand in the way that Google is, but really a brand for companies to be part of.”\n\nAlphabet was a brand for its employees and investors, Page said. But he doesn’t take credit for the name.\n\n“I chose Google, so [Sergey] chose Alphabet.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Teams up With Upstage to Boost Gen AI Efforts",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its generative AI capabilities on the back of its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which has been its key growth driver. Shares of Amazon have gained 83.3% over a year.\r\n\r\nThe latest partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage is a testament to the same.\r\n\r\nAs part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model (SLM) called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nSOLAR MINI is capable of performing various language tasks in Korean and English. The tasks include understanding, summarizing, translating and predicting new content.\r\n\r\nThe model eliminates the requirement of training generative AI models from scratch, thus enabling customers to get started with generative AI seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAs SLMs are lightweight compared with LLMs, SOLAR MINI is well-equipped to run the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions at lower costs, given a training dataset of 10.7 billion parameters.\r\n\r\nNotably, SOLAR MINI is available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart and AWS Marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe underlined collaboration is expected to aid AWS in gaining strong traction among enterprises of all sizes across various industries like entertainment, healthcare, research, e-commerce and education.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nIn addition to the Upstage deal, AWS recently extended its collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with the generative AI technology.\r\n\r\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs. AWS also intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU.\r\n\r\nApart from this, AWS offers Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAWS’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are expected to continue aiding its performance. Moreover, its expanding portfolio will drive its customer momentum, which, in turn, will likely aid its dominant position in the cloud computing market, wherein companies like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google are also gaining steam.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of the total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best affordable tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTech Sector Growth in 2024\n\nOn January 29, Fidelity Investments issued its outlook for the technology sector for 2024 and beyond. According to Fidelity, tech's performance in 2024 will depend on the macro environment to a certain extent. The outlook report noted that in 2023, tech finished the race as the top performer among all market sectors, a position it continued to occupy till late January of 2024, when it still outperformed the S&P 500. The biggest contributor to this has been coming from artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite this, some financial professionals find it difficult to hop on the tech stock wagon, believing that most tech stocks are overpriced. For instance, on February 6, Bloomberg reported that Amundi SA, Europe's biggest fund manager, believes that the optimism in tech stocks is misplaced, resulting in the fund manager refraining from joining the \"big tech stocks frenzy.\" Additionally, analysts at Bank of America Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been drawing parallels between the price levels of tech stocks today and the dot-com era bubble. As is the case with any bubble, it may be the case that this AI bubble, too, will soon burst.\n\nWhile this skepticism is also rising, many investors are still attracted to tech. On January 29, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, appeared on Bloomberg Radio to discuss this. His reasoning for tech stocks remaining an attractive investment is based on the following factors:\n\n\"They have annuity-like businesses, they have pricing power, and they have global brands... the market views them as the stocks they go to. It's the all-weather stock.\"\n\nThus, the debate on whether investors should rush to buy tech stocks or avoid them for the moment continues. For those looking to buy into tech, there are some key areas they should look out for.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop Areas in Tech: AI, Semiconductors, and Cloud Computing\n\nAccording to Fidelity, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and cloud computing are the main areas to look at in the tech sector for investors today. Semiconductor companies have been investing in AI with increasing fervor since the launch of ChatGPT and, in some cases, even before then. The rise of AI has actually propelled semiconductor companies to greater heights since the use of their chips in AI applications has become practically essential. In the case of cloud computing, dedicated tech investors will know that this area of tech has been around and been popular for a long time. With companies and enterprises swiftly moving their data and workloads to the cloud, companies offering cloud-based software are gaining and retaining investor attention and money.\n\nAll in all, tech may be a sector with a bright future. According to Deloitte's 2024 Technology Industry Outlook, global IT investments in 2024 are expected to see double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services. Additionally, analyst estimates show that public cloud spending will grow by over 20% this year, with AI investments also significantly contributing to increased overall spending growth for tech. Deloitte's outlook noted that by 2025, AI-related investments may reach $200 billion globally, with the US leading in this area.\n\nConsidering the above, big-tech companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are considered to be the best investment picks this year. However, these companies are far from affordable for many investors, including many new investors. This is especially the case considering the skepticism concerning the perceived overvaluation of tech stocks in the market today. Hence, cheaper tech stocks with immense potential in today's market may be an excellent place to start your tech investment. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best affordable tech stocks to buy now. Our list includes some of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the tech stocks to buy that are too cheap to ignore. 13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best affordable tech stocks to buy, we used a stock screener to identify tech stocks with share prices below $50 and P/E ratios under 25. We then shortlisted our 13 best affordable tech stocks by looking at their upside potentials and selected the stocks with the highest upside potentials. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of March 24. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A major commuter bridge in Baltimore collapsed after being rammed by a container ship, causing vehicles to plunge into the water and threatening chaos at one of the most important ports on the US East Coast.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Trump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction US CEOs Extend China Stay on Last-Minute Invite to Meet Xi\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority issued an alert on X telling drivers not to use Interstate 695. Kevin Cartwright of the Baltimore City Fire Department described it as “a mass casualty, multi-agency incident” in an audio interview with CNN, adding as many as 20 people could be in the water.\n\nThe disaster at the Francis Scott Key Bridge happened early Tuesday. It’s likely to cause huge disruption — both for shipping at one of the busiest ports on the US East Coast and on the roads — now that a key link has been severed on the major highway encircling Baltimore.\n\nThe vessel is the Dali, which sails under the flag of Singapore. The 32,000-ton ship was built in 2015. A London-based spokesman for Synergy Marine, its manager, said the Dali had around 4,900 containers on board at the time. Company executives were traveling to the site to assess the situation.\n\nThe bridge allows commercial ships to enter the Port of Baltimore, one of the top ports in the US in terms of volume and value of cargoes. It is the largest US port for handling cars and light trucks.\n\nAt least 21 ships are in waters to the west of the collapsed bridge. About half of them are tugs. There also at least three bulk carriers, one vehicles carrier and a small tanker.\n\nAn extended shutdown is going to bring chaos for travelers just ahead of the Easter holiday weekend on the already clogged corridor between New York and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Baltimore port handled 847,158 autos and light trucks in 2023, the most of any US port for the thirteenth straight year, according to a state of Maryland website. The port also handled large volumes of imported sugar, gypsum and coffee, as well as exported coal.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dali was carrying containers from East Asia to the US East Coast via the Panama Canal. It can haul the equivalent of about 9,700 steel boxes, about half the size of the industry’s largest ships.\n\nIt arrived at the Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore on March 24 after delivering to the Port of New York /New Jersey, and had offloaded a small amount of containers before attempting its return journey to Asia early Tuesday morning.\n\n(Updates with cargo information in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Are Considerably Cheaper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend has changed the corporate landscape more than the advent of the internet. However, the arrival of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may give history a run for its money.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be delegated to humans. The incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to \"learn\" over time and become more proficient at their tasks, is what ultimately gives AI utility in practically every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock has soared thanks to the AI revolution\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the span of a little over one year, it's become the foundational-infrastructure play in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for a greater-than 90% share of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia is still in the process of ramping its production. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should help ease supply chain issues for Nvidia and allow the company to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they usually are.\n\nIn addition to contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own to either complement or replace Nvidia's data-center infrastructure. Even if Nvidia is able to maintain some degree of advantage(s) over these in-house GPUs from its top customers, future orders from these four businesses are liable to taper.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia finds itself at risk of cannibalizing its own gross margin as it expands production. The reason data-center sales more than tripled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) is because of GPU scarcity. Demand was so strong for its A100 and H100 chips that the company was able to dramatically increase the price of these units. As Nvidia's GPU production, and that of its competition, increases, industrywide GPU scarcity and Nvidia's pricing power should wane.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the most damning factor of all might be Nvidia's valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget Nvidia: These two \"Magnificent Seven\" components are considerably cheaper\n\nThere are a number of ways to \"value\" stocks. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works well for mature businesses, it doesn't do a particularly good job of valuing the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's largest and most influential businesses (listed in order of descending market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia  Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven businesses offer well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in their respective industries. They're also well known for reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. That's why cash flow tends to be the best measure of value when analyzing Nvidia and its peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs of the closing bell on March 22, Nvidia was valued at just north of 30 times Wall Street's forward-year cash-flow estimates. That makes Nvidia the priciest stock within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe good news for investors is that two other Magnificent Seven components with artificial intelligence ties are historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus cash-flow forecasts, Alphabet is expected to generate more than $11 in cash flow per share in 2025. Based on its closing price for March 22, this places Alphabet at roughly 13.5 times forward-year cash flow. Not only is this less than half the multiple Nvidia trades at, but it represents a roughly 24% discount to Alphabet's price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe operating segment that makes Alphabet tick is Google. In February, Google registered a 91.6% share of worldwide internet search, according to GlobalStats. It's sustained at least a 90% monthly share of global search dating back nine years. Being the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s), it suggests Google should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut it's Alphabet's cloud-infrastructure service platform, Google Cloud, which offers the most promise in terms of cash-flow growth. Google Cloud accounted for a 10% share of global cloud-infrastructure service spend during the September-ended quarter, and this segment delivered its first year of profits in 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also where Alphabet has many of its artificial intelligence tie-ins. It's allowing customers to use generative AI solutions to build applications within the cloud that can improve customer interactions and/or help businesses better target consumers with their advertising.\n\nEnterprise cloud spending looks to be in its early stages of ramping up, which suggests double-digit sales growth can continue for the higher-margin Google Cloud.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably cheaper AI stock than Nvidia is none other than e-commerce titan Amazon.\n\nDespite hitting a fresh 52-week high last week, Amazon ended March 22 at a multiple of only 13 times Wall Street's estimated forward-year cash flow. This represents a 43% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and it's markedly lower then Nvidia's multiple-to-forward-year cash flow.\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online retail platform. The company's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year, which was more than 31 percentage points above its next-closest competitor.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find that online retail sales generate low margins and don't contribute much to Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Rather, the company's ancillary operating segments, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhereas Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global cloud-infrastructure service spending, AWS sits at the top of the pecking order with a 31% share, according to estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is deploying generative AI solutions in a multitude of ways within its cloud platform to allow users to build applications. On an annualized run-rate basis, AWS is generating nearly $97 billion in sales and is consistently responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon's other ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Luring more than 2 billion unique users to its website each month has fueled ad sales for Amazon. Likewise, it crossed above 200 million monthly worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of the National Football League for Thursday Night Football.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Alphabet (GOOGL) closed at $150.07, marking a -0.46% move from the previous day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.31%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.41%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.27%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the internet search leader had gained 4.73% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.86%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.05%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Alphabet will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.58% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.77 per share and a revenue of $290.4 billion, signifying shifts of +16.72% and +13.21%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.03% lower within the past month. Alphabet is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Alphabet's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 22.26. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.97, so one might conclude that Alphabet is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note that GOOGL has a PEG ratio of 1.39 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.21 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, positioning it in the top 30% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "title": "Explainer-Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act?",
        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.\n\nLast year, Brussels designated six companies as \"gatekeepers\" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThey were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.\n\nBelow is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:\n\nANTI-STEERING:\n\nTwo of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around \"anti-steering\" behaviour.\n\nWhenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.\n\nTo get around this, app developers sometimes \"steer\" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.\n\nApple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.\n\nThe EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify, which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.\n\nBeyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.\n\nStory continues\n\nSELF-PREFERENCING:\n\nIn bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.\n\nThat becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.\n\nAnother of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking.com or Skyscanner.\n\nThe EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.\n\nThe EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.\n\nThe law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a \"pay or be tracked\" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.\n\nFollowing questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.\n\nOn Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.\n\nWHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?\n\nGoogle, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" Meta said.\n\n($1 = 0.9233 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

        "title": "RPT-UPDATE 3-Apple, Google, Meta targeted in EU's first Digital Markets Act probes",
        "content": "(Repeats to more subscribers)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer\n\nBRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies. The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover. U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.\n\nTech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six \"gatekeepers\" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices. But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.\n\nAsked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.\n\n\"The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,\" he told a press conference.\n\nAPPLE COMPLIANCE\n\nAt issue is whether Apple complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.\n\nAnother concern for regulators is \"steering\": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes. Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.\n\nFEES OR NO FEES\n\nThe Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's \"free of charge\" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.\n\nBreton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" the spokesperson said. Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.\n\nThe Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon's ranking practices on its marketplace.\n\nAmazon is another DMA \"gatekeeper\", along with Microsoft and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\n\"Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.\"\n\nThe EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.\n\nThe EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bart Meijer; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Catherine Evans)",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction among sports clients on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest extended multi-year partnership between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its existing client, Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL), which is responsible for is responsible for the entire operating business of the Ligaverband, including the Bundesliga and Bundesliga leagues.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration is about driving innovation across Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2. As part of this, AWS becomes the official generative AI provider for DFL and also remains the official technology provider for the latter.\r\n\r\nDFL strives to deliver enhanced fan experience and boost media production. It also intends to automate the recognition of match events by leveraging AWS’ data services and applying a statistics portfolio.\r\n\r\nAWS’ robust generative AI capabilities and large language models will help DFL in creating real-time match commentary in written form and in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nSince 2020, DFL has been experiencing successful execution of various projects with the help of AWS, including Bundesliga Match Facts, which is powered by AWS.\r\n\r\nThe latest move by DFL highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’s innovative cloud products and services.\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of DFL has added strength to AWS’ customer base. It also highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’ innovative cloud products and services. Its concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NTT DOCOMO selected AWS and intends to leverage the latter’s robust infrastructure and cloud services to deploy its nationwide 5G Open Radio Access Network in Japan.\r\n\r\nOwkin also selected AWS as the primary cloud provider. Owkin intends to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials with the help of AWS’s scalable storage options, enhanced data security measures and strong computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nChoice Hotels International CHH went all-in on AWS. It closed its last data center and shifted its entire system infrastructure to AWS. Choice Hotels strives to update its hotel-facing operations and management tools seamlessly to enable its franchisees to have up-to-the-minute access to the latest innovations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’ expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In fourth-quarter 2023, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of the total sales), which grew 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become an integral part of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Conclude\n\nWe believe that AWS’ growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues), up 25.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.4 billion and $322.55 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It comes just weeks after it was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.\n\nThe investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.\n\nThe European Commission said Meta’s fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.\n\nMr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”",

        "title": "Exclusive-Behind the plot to break Nvidia’s grip on AI by targeting software",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia earned its $2.2 trillion market cap by producing artificial-intelligence chips that have become the lifeblood powering the new era of generative AI developers from startups to Microsoft, OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.\n\nAlmost as important to its hardware is the company’s nearly 20 years' worth of computer code, which helps make competition with the company nearly impossible. More than 4 million global developers rely on Nvidia's CUDA software platform to build AI and other apps.\n\nNow a coalition of tech companies that includes Qualcomm, Google and Intel plans to loosen Nvidia’s chokehold by going after the chip giant’s secret weapon: the software that keeps developers tied to Nvidia chips. They are part of an expanding group of financiers and companies hacking away at Nvidia's dominance in AI.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We're actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,\" Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm's head of AI and machine learning, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStarting with a piece of technology developed by Intel called OneAPI, the UXL Foundation, a consortium of tech companies, plans to build a suite of software and tools that will be able to power multiple types of AI accelerator chips, executives involved with the group told Reuters. The open-source project aims to make computer code run on any machine, regardless of what chip and hardware powers it.\n\n\"It's about specifically - in the context of machine learning frameworks - how do we create an open ecosystem, and promote productivity and choice in hardware,\" Google's director and chief technologist of high-performance computing, Bill Hugo, told Reuters in an interview. Google is one of the founding members of UXL and helps determine the technical direction of the project, Hugo said.\n\nUXL's technical steering committee is preparing to nail down technical specifications in the first half of this year. Engineers plan to refine the technical details to a \"mature\" state by the end of the year, executives said. These executives stressed the need to build a solid foundation to include contributions from multiple companies that can also be deployed on any chip or hardware.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond the initial companies involved, UXL will court cloud-computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft's Azure, as well as additional chipmakers.\n\nSince its launch in September, UXL has already begun to receive technical contributions from third parties that include foundation members and outsiders keen on using the open-source technology, the executives involved said. Intel's OneAPI is already useable, and the second step is to create a standard programming model of computing designed for AI.\n\nUXL plans to put its resources toward addressing the most pressing computing problems dominated by a few chipmakers, such as the latest AI apps and high-performance computing applications. Those early plans feed in to the organization's longer-term goal of winning over a critical mass of developers to its platform.\n\nUXL eventually aims to support Nvidia hardware and code, in the long run.\n\nWhen asked about the open source and venture-funded software efforts to break Nvidia’s AI dominance, Nvidia executive Ian Buck said in a statement: \"The world is getting accelerated. New ideas in accelerated computing are coming from all across the ecosystem, and that will help advance AI and the scope of what accelerated computing can achieve.\"\n\nNEARLY 100 STARTUPS\n\nThe UXL Foundation's plans are one of many efforts to chip away at Nvidia's hold on the software that powers AI. Venture financiers and corporate dollars have poured more than $4 billion into 93 separate efforts, according to custom data compiled by PitchBook at Reuters’ request.\n\nThe interest in unseating Nvidia through a potential weakness in software has ramped up in the last year, and startups aiming to poke holes in the company's leadership gobbled up just over $2 billion in 2023 compared with $580 million from a year ago, according to the data from PitchBook.\n\nSuccess in the shadow of Nvidia's group on AI data crunching is an achievement that few of the startups will be able to achieve. Nvidia's CUDA is a compelling piece of software on paper, as it is full-featured and is consistently growing both from Nvidia's contributions and the developer community.\n\n\"But that's not what really matters,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. \"What matters is the fact that people have been using CUDA for 15 years, they built code around it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Why We Like The Returns At Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we really liked what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alphabet:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.28 = US$88b ÷ (US$402b - US$82b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nTherefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.1% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Alphabet .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Alphabet. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 28%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 62%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nTo sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 151% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL on our platform that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nAlphabet is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "title": "2 Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $500 and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Stocks known as the Magnificent Seven -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- have helped the S&P 500 recover from its bear market low and roar into bull territory. These industry leaders all are involved in technology in some way, and each one also offers investors exposure to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). These players are doing some or all of the following: developing AI, using it to improve their own operations, and selling AI tools to customers.\n\nYou don't have to buy every Magnificent Seven stock to benefit though. By scooping up shares of just a couple of these players, you can gain access to a company that already has proven its ability to grow earnings over time and has what it takes to win in a potential AI revolution. In even more good news, you don't need a fortune to invest in these promising AI stocks. In fact, with less than $500, you can buy two top Magnificent Seven AI stocks -- ones you'll want to hold onto for the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a giant in two high-growth areas -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- that have helped the company bring in billions of dollars in earnings in recent years. The company's dominance in these markets is set to continue as it's invested in key areas to support growth.\n\nFor example, in e-commerce, Amazon recently reached its fastest delivery times ever and aims to get even speedier. And in cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has invested heavily in technology infrastructure and expanded its offerings.\n\nAll of that sounds good, but Amazon's focus on AI makes the picture even brighter. The company is using this technology across its e-commerce business to streamline operations and better serve customers. This should result in cost savings and keep shoppers coming back -- and that is set to boost earnings over time.\n\nAnd AWS is bringing a vast menu of AI products and services to its customers, from access to top chips to power platforms to a fully managed service that lets them customize already existing large language models. These efforts also should lift earnings over the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has a track record of growth in return on invested capital (ROIC) over time, showing the company has made wise investment decisions. So, there's reason to believe this trend could continue. AMZN Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nAMZN Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts\n\nAnd you can get in on this story for about 42x times forward earnings estimates, a deal considering Amazon's strength in both e-commerce and cloud, and its long-term AI prospects.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another leader in its field. The company is parent of search engine Google, which consistently holds more than 90% of the global search market. And it's very likely Google will hold onto its position well into the future.\n\nWhy? Because it's become part of most people's routines and even entered our vocabulary: If you don't know the answer to a question, you \"Google it.\" So as long as Google continues generating good search results, it should stay ahead.\n\nBut Alphabet is doing something to truly ensure the quality of its searches and therefore hang onto its market share. The company is investing in AI. Alphabet's Search Generative Experience, available in certain countries, already is speeding up searches and offering a broader range of links and answers to questions.\n\nStaying ahead in search is crucial for Alphabet since the company makes most of its revenue from advertising on the Google Search platform. If advertisers continue to see that most people favor Google, they'll continue spending their ad dollars there -- and if AI makes Google Search even better, advertisers might even increase their Google ad spending.\n\nBut Alphabet isn't stopping there. The company recently announced its most powerful AI model ever, Gemini, and is applying it across its products and services. This tech powerhouse may be a smaller player than Amazon in cloud services, but Google Cloud is posting strong growth -- with double-digit gains in the most recent quarter. And its offering of AI tools could keep that solid pace of growth going.\n\nAll of this means Alphabet looks dirt cheap at 22x times forward earnings estimates and could be a winning AI stock for you over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, in the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets that took effect earlier this month.\n\nThe European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services” by forcing them to comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable\" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.\n\nThe commission said in a press release that it “suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.”\n\nIt's looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to offers available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.\n\nGoogle is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”\n\nThe commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers. It's also looking into Meta's option for users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.\n\n“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.",

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFollowing monumental gains, Super Micro Computer has found itself on the chopping block\n\nOne company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.\n\nSuper Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares sold Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares sold Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares sold\n\nWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.\n\nBut while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSteven Cohen adds time-tested, bubble-resistant AI stocks\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchased\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nSelling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.\n\nKen Griffin piles into the infrastructure backbones of the AI movement\n\nA second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:\n\nNvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchased Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchased\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.\n\nAt the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.\n\nGriffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.\n\nDon't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.\n\nIsrael Englander opts for a couple Magnificent Seven components\n\nThe final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\n\nBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.\n\nAlphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.\n\nBut Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.\n\nHowever, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best small cap AI stocks to buy now. To skip our detailed analysis of the AI sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Small Cap AI Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAI: A Consequential Technology\n\nArtificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. AI has become one of the most exciting things to come out of the technology sector. As a result, some of the best AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are working the hardest to contribute to the AI race and maybe even lead it, have been attracting even larger amounts of investor attention. This is unsurprising, considering the immense growth AI has been undergoing. On February 14, George Lee, the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Office of Applied Innovation, discussed the growth potential of artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to geopolitics, and how geopolitics, in turn, may shape an AI-enabled future, on CNBC's \"Capital Connection.\" Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"For me, where I specialize is really this intersection of generative AI and geopolitics. The rise of this new capability in the world is super consequential for countries and for regions, matters of economics, defense, and even culture itself, as Jensen Huang talked about the other day.\"\n\nOn being asked how he expects machine intelligence to impact global growth, productivity, and the US-China conflict, Lee made the following comments:\n\n\"Well, our economists have called for a very significant impact, over a 10-year period, some 1.5% increase in global GDP as a result of this [AI]. Now, I think the important thing to reflect on that is that it's a 10 year interval. While this has arrived abruptly, it's hugely consequential and fascinating, it will take time for this to deepen its impact across economies around the world. And so, we're very focused on trying to monitor that, and I think, my personal view is that there is going to be remarkable productivity and economic gains emerging from this. There's also going to be an incredible leap in human creativity and productivity as we partner with machines just to address and solve challenges that have been prohibitively difficult in the past.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Lee, humanity will likely evolve with machines and artificial intelligence, resulting in exceptional growth moving forward. He noted the following:\n\n\"In a sense, I think we will co-evolve with these machines, and look, we are very early days in this new generative AI revolution, but the pace of improvement, the trajectory of improvement, is so remarkable, that I think we do have to think pretty broadly about how we're going to co-exist with machines, how we're going to cooperate, and how, together, we can elevate humanity.\"\n\nGlobal Leaders in the AI Space\n\nWith the discussion on AI rapidly gaining speed and importance across the globe, many are beginning to wonder which global players will lead the way in this new global world order that is so heavily impacted by technology and artificial intelligence in particular. Lee gave his opinion on the matter of global leaders in the AI race as well. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The US and China have an early lead in this. Like other technology revolutions, such as the internet, a lot of this sprang from the US, both academic and commercial roots. China is somewhat challenged in this area, both because they're export-controlled away from some of the key technologies they need, and there's also this issue of the emergent quality of chatbots being somewhat threatening to regimes that are sensitive to social harmony and stability. But make no mistake, they are a formidable adversary and will be leaders in this space. You then have a series of countries, the EU, England, France, etc., who are going to be very consequential here, particularly in terms of regulation. Then you have countries that have a particular technology edge in this domain, those are places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands. And then, most interestingly, you have countries like the UAE... who have done extraordinary work in building their Falcon open source model, the work they've done around Arabic language foundation models, and just the general infrastructure investing they're doing.\"\n\nConsidering the above highlights, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy, particularly the best small-cap AI stocks to buy now.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the top 12 stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio. To skip the details on Soros’ life, investment philosophy, and his fund’s latest bets, go directly to the Top 5 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio.\n\nBillionaire George Soros is one of the most famous hedge fund managers in the world, primarily known for shorting $10 billion worth of British pounds on September 16, 1992, a day known as “Black Wednesday.\" This trade made Soros $1 billion in profit in a single day as the currency declined against the German mark and US dollar by 15% and 25%, respectively. After this event, he has been known as \"the man who broke the Bank of England.\"\n\nWhile Black Wednesday was the event that made George Soros a huge celebrity, it wasn't his only successful foreign exchange bet. His global macro-investing strategies have made billions for him and his firm. He made $1 billion from Thailand's financial crisis in 1997, and in 2013, he made big bucks by betting against the Japanese yen.\n\nLike all successful investors, Soros also faced some setbacks in his life. One such example would be his investments in Russian bonds in 1998. When the Russian financial crisis deepened, Russia defaulted on its debt obligations, including its government bonds. His firm lost $2 billion on the investment. However, this loss was just a small hurdle in his career and an insignificant event compared to his overall performance. He has still proven himself as one of the most successful people in the world of finance despite his few failures.\n\nSoros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970, which was formerly a hedge fund and is now a family office since 2011. He retired from all his responsibilities in June 2023 and handed them over to his son. As of February 28, George Soros has a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nSoros is also known as one of the greatest philanthropists. He has donated $32 billion to philanthropic causes. In 1993, he founded Open Society Foundations, which focuses on causes such as justice, education, public health, and independent media.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment Philosophy\n\nSoros's investment strategies combined scientific analysis, such as his application of economic theories like reflexivity, with an understanding of market dynamics and human behavior. This approach allowed him to achieve significant success as an investor. His reflexivity theory suggests that the perceptions and actions of individuals can influence and even distort the reality they perceive. The theory suggests that our beliefs about the world can shape the way the world works. In financial markets, it suggests that investors' beliefs about the value of assets can affect the actual value of those assets, leading to bubbles or crashes.\n\nIn his book, The Alchemy of Finance, Soros said:\n\n“The fact that a thesis is flawed does not mean that we should not invest in it as long as other people believe in it and there is a large group of people left to be convinced. The point was made by John Maynard Keynes when he compared the stock market to a beauty contest where the winner is not the most beautiful contestant but the one whom the greatest number of people consider beautiful. Where I have something significant to add is in pointing out that it pays to look for the flaws; if we find them, we are ahead of the game because we can limit our losses when the market also discovers what we already know. It is when we are unaware of what could go wrong that we have to worry.”\n\nGeorge Soros' reflexivity theory made him a contrarian investor. He is known for his ability to identify undervalued assets and invest in them when others are selling. Between 1970 and 2000, Soros had an average annual returns of 30%, which makes him one of the most successful portfolio managers in the world.\n\nSoros Fund Management Q4 Bets\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio value increased from $7.05 billion to $7.65 billion. The fund made 75 new purchases, including Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Avantor, Inc. (NYSE:AVTR). The firm increased its holdings in 75 stocks, including a 482% increase in Sempra (NYSE:SRE) and 237% in Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX). Sempra is also among the stocks in our list of the Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024.\n\nIn addition, Soros Fund decreased its holdings in 41 stocks and completely closed out 75 positions. Some of the top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio include Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Top 5 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio\n\nGeorge Soros of Soros Fund Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Soros Fund Management’s Q4 2023 portfolio and picked its top 12 stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nTop 12 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio\n\n12. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a Dublin-based company engaged in providing management and technology consulting services and solutions.\n\nOn February 20, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) reported that it is planning to acquire GemSeek. The company would expand its offerings, including customer analytics and AI capabilities through this acquisition.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio, along with Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a California-based company that provides freight transport, ride-hailing services, food delivery, and more.\n\nOn February 20, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced that Uber Eats is expanding its autonomous operations internationally to Japan by the end of next month. The company, in partnership with Mitsubishi Electric and Cartken, will deliver food through the use of autonomous robots in some parts of Tokyo.\n\nOn February 14, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced its first-ever share repurchase program through which the company will buy back its common stock of up to $7 billion.\n\nRiverPark Advisors mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n10. Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J)\n\nJacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) is a Texas-based company that offers technical professional services, including but not limited to construction services and scientific and specialty consulting.\n\nOn February 15, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) announced that it was chosen as the lead design consultant by Rua Al Madinah Holding Company for a big urban development project in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn January 25, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) increased its quarterly dividend by 11.5% to $0.29, payable by March 22 to the shareholders of record on February 23. As of the February 28 market close, the stock’s dividend yield was 0.79%.\n\nMadison Investments commented on Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) was down after missing earnings expectations and providing 2024 guidance below expectations. While revenue growth remains strong with high single digit growth, costs were higher than expected mostly related to the carrying cost of the upcoming spin of its government services business. We estimate that post the spin, Jacobs will have a higher growth rate and higher margin profile with an improved balance sheet.”\n\n9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a Connecticut-based company that offers online travel and related services.\n\nOn February 22, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) initiated its quarterly dividend of $8.75, payable by March 28 to the shareholders of record on March 8. The stock’s dividend yield was 1.001% as of the February 28 market close.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported a non-GAAP EPS of $32.00, which beat the estimates by $1.95. The revenue increased by 18.0% year-over-year (YoY) to $4.78 billion, surpassing the estimates by $70 million.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n8. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a Washington-based company that focuses on e-commerce, AI, cloud computing, online advertising, and more. The company grabs the eighth spot on our list of top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Q4 as the number of hedge funds with investments in the stock was 293, up from 286 in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that its cloud computing unit plans on making an investment worth $5 billion in Mexico for cloud infrastructure projects over the next 15 years.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was mentioned in Polen Capital’s fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which saw significant price appreciation throughout much of 2023, saw its share price increase materially in Q4 following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings report. We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures. Our position in Amazon reflects our positive long-term expectations of the business, and it is currently our largest absolute weight in the Portfolio.”\n\n7.

        "title": "Here's My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for Long-Term Investors to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have dominated investing headlines recently, as this exclusive group of megacap companies are in a league of their own and have mostly delivered strong performance recently.\n\nWhile Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has certainly been the most exciting Magnificent Seven stock to watch so far in 2024, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been in a two-way race for the title of the largest market cap in the U.S. stock market, I wouldn't be surprised if the best performer in the Magnificent Seven over the next five to 10 years was Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nThe two sides of Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, and for good reason. In addition to the Google Search business, which is dominant in its industry, Google also has Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android mobile operating system, just to name a few. These collectively are known as the Google Services business. In fact, I've used four different Google products in the process of writing this article. This is a massive business that generates a ton of reliable, high-margin income.\n\nThe other main part of the business is Google Cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure provider that competes with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. It has the number three market share right now but is growing fast.\n\nAlphabet could be a big long-term winner\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money from ad sales, especially on the Google Services side of the business, and there could be more potential for growth here than it seems. Thanks to evolving AI technology, Alphabet is continually getting better at targeting ads more effectively, which inherently makes them more valuable. Plus, while there is certainly limited growth potential in its search business, that's not the case for some of Alphabet's other ad-driven platforms, such as YouTube.\n\nGoogle Cloud is definitely the more interesting part of the business from a growth perspective. It makes up less than 11% of the company's total revenue today, but is also the fastest growing part of Alphabet, with 26% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. In fact, as recently as 2018, Google Cloud made up just over 4% of the company's total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could just be the starting point. The cloud computing market is estimated to be $676 billion in size today but is expected to roughly quadruple to $2.3 trillion by 2032. If Google Cloud can simply maintain its market share, this could be a big growth driver, but recent data indicates that Google Cloud is gaining on the market leaders.\n\nTremendous profitability and a reasonable valuation\n\nIt's also worth noting that Alphabet has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which combined with the more than $80 billion in annualized net income it generated in the most recent quarter gives it tremendous financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise.\n\nWith a valuation of about 22 times forward earnings, I wouldn't exactly call Alphabet a cheap stock, although it is easily the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven by this metric. However, it does seem attractively valued for a market-leading and highly profitable business growing revenue at a double-digit rate. Alphabet is a rare combination of a dominant core business and a rapidly growing secondary business with massive, long-tailed growth potential. And while it isn't the largest stock in the Magnificent Seven today, I wouldn't be at all shocked for that to change within the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Is the Next \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Pay a Dividend (and It Could Be the Biggest of the Bunch)",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't exactly know for their dividends but rather for their growth. But if a company's payout can grow by double digits for a large number of years, investing in leading tech growth stocks today could yield some impressive retirement income decades down the road.\n\nWhat could be even more lucrative? If you own a high-growth stock that begins to start paying a dividend after you've owned it for a number of years. When this fortunate event happens, one has probably already seen a large appreciation in the stock, so even a small nominal yield can amount to a substantial payout relative to one's initial investment.\n\nOf the three remaining Mag Seven stocks that don't pay a dividend, I'd say it's a pretty solid bet which one will be next. Not only that, but its potential payout could offer the highest yield of the group when it begins.\n\nAlphabet is a cash cow that should really pay a dividend\n\nWith exception of perhaps Apple and Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet is the Magnificent Seven stock with the greatest capacity to pay a dividend -- and yet it doesn't.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet generated a massive $74 billion in net income, which is the third highest profit figure of the Mag Seven. And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft's $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.\n\nCompany Net Income (TTM) Dividend Yield  Payout Ratio Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $100.9 billion 0.55% 14.8% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $82.5 billion 0.71% 25.2% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) $73.8 billion 0% 0% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $39.1 billion 0.40% 13.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $29.8 billion 0.16% 1.3%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion.\n\nTo its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.\n\nBut all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out.\n\nSome may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds.\n\nReasons to not pay a dividend\n\nOf course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.\n\nI think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nYet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time.\n\nStill, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments.\n\nAlphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various \"moonshot\" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.\n\nA dividend is probably coming at some point\n\nOnce Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.\n\nWhile it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech",
        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee\n\nBRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.\n\nThat in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.\n\nGoogle has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called \"Baby Bells\" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.\n\nRegulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.\n\nThe U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.\n\nEven so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.\n\nThe U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.\n\nBig Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStory continues\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.\n\nShe said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.\n\nVestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.\n\nEuropean Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.\n\n\"If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,\" he said on Friday.\n\nBREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO\n\nIt is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.\n\n\"In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,\" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nApple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.\n\n\"It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,\" he said.\n\nHe said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.\n\n\"What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,\" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.\n\n\"I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,\" he said.\n\nApple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.\n\nStructural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.\n\n\"I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, additional reporting by Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Ken Li and Anna Driver)",

        "title": "Here Are the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Warren Buffett and David Tepper Both Own",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and David Tepper might not seem to have a lot in common -- aside from the fact that they're both wildly successful investors. Buffett is much more cautious by nature and usually shies away from tech stocks. Tepper is aggressive and invests heavily in the tech sector.\n\nBut these billionaires share at least a few common denominators. Here are the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that both Buffett and Tepper own.\n\nGreat minds think alike -- sometimes\n\nTepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund has positions in most of the Magnificent Seven stocks. The fund's top four holdings are Meta Platforms, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Nvidia. Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) ranks as Appaloosa's seventh-largest position. There are only two Magnificent Seven stocks that Tepper doesn't own -- Apple and Tesla.\n\nBuffett is a huge fan of Apple. Last year, he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting that Apple was \"a better business than any we own.\" It's by far the biggest position for Berkshire, accounting for nearly 43% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nUnlike Tepper, though, Buffett hasn't loaded up on several other Magnificent Seven stocks. The only member of the group besides Apple in Berkshire's portfolio is Amazon. So, is Amazon the only Magnificent Seven stock that both Buffett and Tepper own? Actually, no.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), manages its own investment portfolio. NEAM has small stakes in Alphabet and Microsoft. Therefore, Buffett has positions in these Magnificent Seven stocks also.\n\nBig winners for the two billionaires\n\nAll three of these Magnificent Seven stocks owned by Buffett and Tepper have been big winners. Amazon especially stands out, with a gain of nearly 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe generative AI boom has provided a nice tailwind for Amazon as customers built AI apps on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. Amazon's efforts to increase its profitability have also paid off handsomely.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's shares have soared close to 50% over the last 12 months. Again, generative AI served as the key catalyst behind this impressive performance. Microsoft integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 AI model throughout its products, appealing to customers seeking to harness the power of generative AI.\n\nSome investors might have thought that Alphabet was being left in the dust by Microsoft and OpenAI. However, the tech stock has jumped around 45% over the last 12 months. Alphabet's Google Cloud business is benefiting from the surging interest in generative AI just as AWS and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform are.\n\nAre Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft magnificent stocks to buy now?\n\nJust because Buffett and Tepper own Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft doesn't mean you should buy them too. There are some knocks against these members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nE-commerce isn't the fast-growing market for Amazon that it once was. AI could present a threat to Alphabet's Google Search advertising revenue. Microsoft's valuation is frothy, with shares trading at more than 31 times forward earnings.\n\nHowever, I think that the pros outweigh the cons for all three stocks. The cloud units of Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft should have tremendous growth prospects. Amazon is expanding into new markets, notably including health care. Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business could be a game changer. Microsoft is a more formidable player in gaming with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nSure, these stocks could take a breather after racking up massive gains. For long-term investors, though, I think that Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft remain magnificent stocks to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Could UiPath Become the Next Alphabet?",
        "content": "UiPath(NYSE: PATH) initially impressed investors when it went public in April 2021. The developer of tools for robotic process automation (RPA) listed its IPO at $56, and its stock rallied to a record high of $85.12 the following month.\n\nAt the time, investors were dazzled by the growth potential of its RPA tools, which could be plugged into a company's applications to automate repetitive tasks like entering data, processing invoices, onboarding customers, and sending mass emails.\n\nUiPath's growth supported that bullish thesis. Its revenue soared 81% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in January 2021) and rose 47% in fiscal 2022. The pandemic also drove more companies to automate their office tasks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut in fiscal 2023, UiPath's revenue only rose 19% as inflation, rising interest rates, and the war in Ukraine drove companies to rein in software spending. Its revenue grew 24% in fiscal 2024 as some of those headwinds weakened, but its stock now trades nearly 60% below its IPO price at around $23. The bulls are still ignoring UiPath, so could this $13 billion RPA leader expand and evolve into a tech titan like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) over the next two decades?\n\nUiPath is comparable to Google -- from 20 years ago\n\nUiPath generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Alphabet, which went public as Google in 2004, generated $1.5 billion in revenue in 2003.\n\nBut from 2003 to 2023, Alphabet's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%, rising from $1.5 billion to $307.4 billion. That rapid expansion was driven by the growth of its market-leading search engine, YouTube's streaming video platform (which it acquired in 2006), mobile OS and apps, and other cloud-based services.\n\nIt could be challenging for UiPath to grow at a comparable rate over the next 20 years. For now, analysts expect its revenue to have a CAGR of just 18% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 as the macroeconomic environment stabilizes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company might still leverage its dominance of the growing RPA market to pump out double-digit growth through the end of the decade. UiPath controlled about 36% of the global RPA market last year, according to Gartner, while its closest competitors each held shares of less than 10%. Fortune Business Insights believes the RPA market could still show a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nIf UiPath keeps pace with that market, its annual revenue could hit $7.2 billion by 2030. If the company continues to have a more moderate CAGR of 15% from 2030 to 2044, its revenue could rise to $50 billion by the final year. That would be much lower than the $307 billion in revenue that Alphabet generated in 2023 -- but that growth trajectory could still drive UiPath's stock to be nearly a 40-bagger over the next 20 years if its valuations hold steady.\n\nUiPath still faces unpredictable challenges\n\nUiPath's long-term prospects seems promising, but it faces stiff competition from tech companies like Salesforce and Microsoft, which have both been rolling out more RPA services for their cloud-based ecosystems.\n\nAlso, UiPath faces pressure from C3.ai, which plugs its AI algorithms into a company's software infrastructure to accelerate, automate, and optimize certain tasks. There's also a strong chance that newer generative-AI platforms like ChatGPT will make it easier for companies to automate their own tasks without UiPath's stand-alone RPA tools.\n\nUiPath insists it can roll with the punches by upgrading its RPA platform with more AI tools. It believes those tools will help it process tasks across an unstructured work environment by understanding the data instead of merely automating repetitive tasks.\n\nBut without the support of its own dedicated cloud infrastructure platform, UiPath could struggle to scale those AI services and keep pace with its larger competitors.\n\nIt probably won't become the next Alphabet\n\nUiPath's business is stabilizing, but it remains unprofitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and faces daunting long-term challenges. Its niche RPA market is growing, but it's nowhere as vast as Alphabet's core markets of digital advertising and cloud computing.\n\nTherefore, UiPath might still have room to grow as more companies accelerate their digital transformations, but it's far too early to consider it to be the next Alphabet.\n\nTo be seriously compared to that tech leader, UiPath will need to significantly scale up its RPA business, expand its ecosystem into other markets, and possibly build its own cloud infrastructure to support that growth. Most of those things probably won't happen within the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

The BSI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nThe alleged intrusion effort occurred one year after Germany expelled 50 Russian diplomats to reportedly \"reduce the presence of Russian intelligence in Germany.\"\n\nRelations between the two countries have remained largely frozen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in December.

        "title": "Apple's Days of Smartphone Monopoly Are Coming To An End",
        "content": "On Thursday, U.S. the US Justice Department, along with 17 states and districts, filed a blockbuster lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple has been accused of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market by violating federal antitrust law to stay ahead of its rivals. As a reminder, Apple ended 2023 by dethroning Samsung as the world’s biggest smartphone seller. Samsung led for 12 years, but Apple got the crown after releasing its iPhone 15 in the fall. Apple is well established as the largest smartphone maker in terms of revenue and profits, but this was the first time it led in terms of volume. The success of Huawei in China also contributed to the fall of Samsung, with the Android market being divided between Xiaomi, Google and Honor.\n\nHow did Apple illegal monopolize the smartphone market?\n\nThe Thursday’s lawsuit suggests that Apple used a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. It has used its control over the iPhone operation system iOS to keep innovative apps and cloud streaming services away, as well as to degrade the quality of Google-developed Android messages that are received on iPhones, along with restricting how competing smartwatches work with the iPhone and even forbid the offering of rival payment solutions.\n\nIn simple words, Apple has been accused of making barriers that make it difficult to venture out outside its ecosystem.\n\nThe largest antitrust complaint in a recent wave against Big Tech.\n\nRegulators are doing their best to crack the power Big Tech has been enjoying for quite a while as over the past few decades, its actions were largely unchecked. First, the European regulators kicked off the new year by forcing Apple to give other companies in the EU access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip which enables the creation of digital wallets other than Apple Pay.\n\nNow, the Justice Department is asking the court to forbid Apple to block innovative apps in its store. Also, it demands the court to make Apple remove the restrictions it imposed to prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other applications from integrating smoothly with the iPhone, just like Apple’s apps. It also asked demanded the court to disable Apple from using contractual terms to protect the monopoly it established.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple finds the lawsuit unfair, stating that it compromises its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology with which it became one the world’s most valuable companies. Like its Big Tech peers, Apple has been shrugging off legal criticism for years. But this year’s suits from EU and US regulators challenge its very ID. Regulators are determined in making Big Tech accountable for its actions and ongoing antitrust cases against Apple and Google show things are getting more serious. What is certain is that long gone are the days of Steve Jobs’ era when Apple was a cultural phenomenon due to its relentless pursuit of earth-shattering innovation. Now, Apple is no longer several steps ahead of its rivals and instead of innovating, it is milking Jobs’ legacy while fighting for market share with its CEO focused on financial management. For now, it is financially healthy, but it is a lot more vulnerable than it used to be, with regulators and Chinese rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, biting off its power and dominance. Even Huawei is a competitive threat to Apple at the world's largest smartphone market, China. Meanwhile, Samsung is releasing models with AI features while Apple is lagging its rivals in that race, promising to add AI features this year with Bloomberg having recently reported that it is in talks with Google to power its new iPhone with the Gemini generative AI model.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "Creating wealth for yourself can be supremely satisfying, reducing or wiping out the worries of running out of money in retirement. If you're really good at saving and investing, though, you may be able to do better than just create wealth for yourself. You may create lasting generational wealth, providing for your children and their children and so on.\n\nThe most promising stocks for creating lasting generational wealth are those with seemingly long runways to keep growing. Here are three to consider. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has already made many investors millionaires and seems able to keep doing so. Clearly, one of its biggest businesses is the dominant Google search engine, which generates big bucks via digital ads. In the company's fourth quarter, \"Google Search & other\" provided a whopping 56% of Alphabet's revenue. When you add in YouTube advertising and Google Network dollars, they amount to 76% of total revenue.\n\nYouTube is another dominant online destination for millions, and Alphabet is also home to the widespread Android mobile operating system, the Chrome browser, Google Cloud, the Google Play app store, smart thermostat maker Nest, and Fitbit, among others. It even has its own artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. It can be hard for huge companies to grow huger, but revenue advanced by 13% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023, while operating income jumped 30%.\n\nBetter still, Alphabet's stock seems appealingly valued at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20, below its five-year average of 24.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) isn't a household name in the U.S., but it's a dominant -- and growing -- enterprise in Latin America. It's often described as a mix between Amazon and a company like PayPal, as it's a major e-commerce business coupled with a fintech one, facilitating financial transactions electronically. Indeed, MercadoLibre has even launched its own version of Amazon's Prime service.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company, claiming \"the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America,\" operates in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Peru, and 11 other countries. It's growing briskly, too, with fourth-quarter net revenue up 83% year over year on a currency-neutral basis to $4.3 billion and gross merchandise volume up 79% to $13.5 billion.\n\nA competitive advantage of MercadoLibre is its vertical integration. The company features not only online marketplaces and digital finance but also logistics services, credit solutions, and advertising services. There are risks, of course, but the company has multiple irons in the fire and isn't wholly dependent on any single one.\n\nMercadoLibre's recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47 is steep but still below its five-year average of 110. So, the stock appears to be not quite a bargain but valued lower than it has been in the past.\n\n3. Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF\n\nThe Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (NASDAQ: QQQM) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a fund (encompassing some 100 companies in this case) that trades more like a stock than a mutual fund. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which focuses on 100 of the largest non-financial companies (domestic and international) in the Nasdaq. Here are the top 10 most recent holdings and the percentage of the ETF each represents:\n\nHolding Percentage of ETF's value Microsoft 8.78% Apple 7.66% Nvidia 6.46% Broadcom 4.43% Advanced Micro Devices 2.41% Adobe 1.94% Cisco Systems 1.49% Qualcomm 1.42% Intel 1.40% Intuit 1.36%\n\nSource: Invesco.com, as of March 11, 2024. EFT = exchange-traded fund.\n\nTrying to figure out which businesses will be thriving over decades and helping shareholders build lasting generational wealth can be hard. However, with this single ETF, you'll quickly own 100 companies, with heavy weightings in the companies above. Better still, if some of these companies falter in the years ahead, the index will replace them with better growers. (It's hard to beat index funds when you're looking for easy and powerful investments.)\n\nThe ETF is fairly new. It has averaged annual gains of 12.8% over the past three years. The returns have been lumpy, though: The ETF gained 27.5% in 2021, sank 32.5% in 2022, and soared 55% in 2023. Its annual fee (expense ratio) is a low 0.15%.\n\nSo, give these securities some consideration for berths in your portfolio. Know, too, that there are many other companies that can serve you well as you aim to build a bigger nest egg for yourself and your heirs. Just be sure to buy into any when they're undervalued or reasonably valued -- not grossly overvalued.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top AI Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Most stocks related to artificial intelligence (AI) have been on quite the run in 2024, and many have crossed over into territory that investors might deem \"overvalued.\" However, some of these companies are still fairly priced, and poised for bull runs of their own that could get their values caught up with those of their peers.\n\nI see two AI stocks in particular I think investors would be wise to scoop up now before the rest of the market catches on.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been at the forefront of AI for a long time. The problem is it keeps tripping over its own feet. The tech giant has made one blunder after another in this arena, which is the reason its stock no longer receives the respect it once did.\n\nAlphabet trades at 20.8 times forward earnings, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 trade at ratios of 21.4 and 28.7, respectively. Because Alphabet is tech-focused, comparing its valuation to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 is the most logical comparison. The S&P 500 is much broader, with many components in the banking, materials, and industrial sectors, which tend to trade at lower valuations. This pulls its average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio downward, yet Alphabet is still valued below the S&P 500.\n\nThe market conveys that it doesn't respect Alphabet, but that's a big mistake.\n\nAlphabet is amid a turnaround in two areas. First is its advertising business. Regardless of what the news headlines say about Alphabet's AI prowess, it is primarily an advertising company. In the fourth quarter, 76% of its revenue came from ad-related sources, and its total revenue rose by 11% year over year. Management is bullish on the ad market and is seeing greater returns on ads that utilize its AI models.\n\nThis flies in the face of what many hear about Alphabet's AI products. Alphabet is struggling to produce a consumer-facing generative AI model that won't directly generate revenue, but it's likely succeeding in its development of business-facing AI systems used for advertising and other models.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Alphabet should continue to post strong revenue and earnings growth through 2024, making the cheap stock look even cheaper. To me, this makes the stock a screaming buy, especially because its valuation is far cheaper than any of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers.\n\nUiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a much smaller company than Alphabet, but it is still making waves in its industry. Its robotic process automation software allows its clients to automate repetitive tasks, freeing their employees to do other tasks that require more original and creative thinking.\n\nWhile there are many tasks that robotic process automation software can take over, bringing the power of AI to bear is expanding that list significantly. By using AI to scrape information from emails, reports, or data flows, UiPath's products become more powerful.\n\nUiPath has seen tremendous demand for this software. In its fiscal 2024's fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31, annual recurring revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.46 billion. It's also working toward becoming a fully profitable company, and posted an operating profit of $15.1 million in Q4.\n\nThese are traits of a business that should be respected in the market, but UiPath isn't. Instead, it trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 10.5, while many of its AI peers sport valuations greater than 20 times sales. PATH PS Ratio Chart\n\nUiPath is just as successful as its peers, and sometimes even more so. But because it isn't purely focused on AI, it isn't receiving the same respect from the market. Because of that, I think UiPath is a great stock to buy as it could be slated for a bull run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Is Selling Alphabet and Nvidia Hand Over Fist, but Is Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper likes artificial intelligence (AI) stocks -- the bigger, the better. Pick a megacap AI stock, and there's a pretty good chance that it's in the portfolio of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management.\n\nTepper isn't as big of a fan of some of these stocks as he is of others, though. The successful hedge fund manager has been selling shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) hand over fist, but he has been buying two other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNot so magnificent in Tepper's view\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper slashed Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia by nearly 23%. While the GPU maker still ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest holding, Tepper clearly isn't as bullish about it as he once was.\n\nWhy would the billionaire sell such a big chunk of his position in Nvidia? The most likely answer is its valuation. Nvidia's share price skyrocketed by nearly 240% last year. Tepper could have been concerned, as quite a few other investors were, that the stock's valuation was becoming frothy.\n\nAppaloosa also reduced its stake in Alphabet by more than 16%. Again, Tepper hasn't thrown in the towel on the tech giant. Alphabet remains the seventh-largest position in his hedge fund.\n\nValuation probably wasn't the overriding factor behind the decision to sell some of the stake in Alphabet. It's possible, though, that Tepper might have been concerned that Alphabet's revenue from Google Search could be threatened by the development of AI-powered virtual assistants.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks Tepper is buying\n\nSo which Magnificent Seven stocks is Tepper more enthusiastic about? He added to Appaloosa's stakes in two of them.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) already ranked as Appaloosa's third-biggest holding. In Q4, the hedge fund added another 200,000 shares, increasing its stake by more than 5%.\n\nIt's not hard to think of reasons why Tepper might have decided to invest more heavily in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. Its profitability has been improving significantly, and Tepper could expect this trend to continue in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also remains a fan of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The technology giant held the No. 2 spot in Appaloosa's portfolio going into Q4. During the quarter, Tepper bought an additional 65,000 shares of Microsoft -- enough to boost the hedge fund's stake by nearly 4%.\n\nMicrosoft continues to fire on all cylinders. The company's integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model throughout its product lineup appears to be paying off handsomely. Customers are flocking to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the AI tools that it offers. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also puts it in a stronger position in the gaming market.\n\nSmart moves?\n\nWere these buy-and-sell transactions of Magnificent Seven stocks smart moves on Tepper's part? So far, the verdict is mixed.\n\nBoth stocks that Appaloosa sold have risen since the end of Q4. Nvidia has soared by nearly 80%, while Alphabet is up close to 6%. Adding to his fund's stakes in Amazon and Microsoft, though, has paid off: Each has jumped by a double-digit percentage thus far in 2024.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft eventually catch up with them. However, any sell-off of those stocks would likely only be temporary.\n\nMy view is that Tepper -- and other investors -- would be wise to scoop up more shares of all four of these Magnificent Seven stocks on pullbacks. I expect that AI will serve as a major long-term tailwind for each of them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Earlier this week, Microsoft Corp. named artificial intelligence pioneer Mustafa Suleyman chief of its consumer AI business and hired most of the staff from his Inflection AI startup. A day before, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet Inc.’s Google was in talks to license its Gemini AI engine to Apple Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Yemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be Targeted What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond China Scrutinizes PwC Role in $78 Billion Evergrande Fraud Case\n\nThe moves suggest that despite pouring billions of dollars into partnerships, investments and product development, Microsoft and Google are struggling to figure out how to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. Neither company is moving fast enough to field consumer products that generate revenue and grab market share, and, despite their size and power, they remain vulnerable to being disrupted. Even as engineers labor to perfect the large language models undergirding the technology, the companies are forming alliances and scouring the world for talent and promising startups.\n\nForging a leading position in generative AI requires each of the tech giants to assemble various ingredients—computing power, top-of-the-line AI models, trustworthy and easy-to-use products and ways of getting them to people. None of the tech giants has all of the ingredients. Google, once the pioneer in large language models, keeps releasing products with worrying errors and biases. Microsoft got a head start with exclusive access to many of OpenAI’s ground-breaking models, but has never been skilled at building exciting consumer products besides video games. Apple is years behind in AI and planning to announce a comeback strategy in June, but it does have the iPhone and app store.\n\n“Even large tech companies and cloud providers, with their vast resources, cannot innovate the entire generative AI ecosystem single handedly,” said Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. “Companies must constantly be on the lookout for the best talent and technology to fill gaps in their portfolios.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella isn’t satisfied with his team’s efforts to create consumer products, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Over the past year, the company has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products—creating various digital assistants under the new Copilot brand. Yet the new Bing has made few gains against search market leader Google, and the other products are works in progress. Though OpenAI has given Microsoft a first mover advantage, the startup is focused on the underlying technology not developing products for the software giant.\n\nThat’s why Nadella recruited Suleyman to be executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, along with Inflection AI co-founder Karén Simonyan, who will become chief scientist of the new unit. Nadella wanted someone to unify and oversee product development and believes he found that person in Suleyman, with whom he bonded during conversations about how AI could be tailored to individual users.\n\n“Really all we’re trying to do is craft a true end-to-end product experience, so the user feels that there is a seamless, fluid, human-like conversational interaction,” Suleyman said in an interview Monday. He likened the work to sculpting and said “that art requires you to know the real sweet spot of when a piece of technology is ready and how to dress the experience so that it has an essence and a character which is familiar and accessible and trusted.”\n\nNadella also knows that because AI will completely transform the industry, even Microsoft’s flagship products aren’t immune to disruption—whether by a peer like Google or a startup that hasn’t even been invented yet. “These businesses are big and they’re all going to get re-litigated, right?” Nadella said in an interview. “So even the incumbents can’t take it for granted.”\n\nNadella’s faith in Suleyman isn’t universally shared. During his time at Google’s DeepMind, Suleyman wasn’t focused on consumer products. At Inflection AI, he oversaw the development of a chatbot called Pi that was designed to interact with users in a more human and supportive fashion. But despite attracting a million active daily users, the startup never found a business case. Suleyman was also accused of treating DeepMind employees poorly. He has acknowledged making mistakes and says he learned from the experience. Still, it’s unclear how well he’ll mesh with Microsoft’s existing team.\n\nThe proposed partnership between Google and Apple is still being worked out so there are few details of how exactly it would work. But assuming the deal comes to fruition, it could help each company with their AI efforts.\n\nSince early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model codenamed Ajax, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees also have been trying out a basic chatbot dubbed Apple GPT. But Apple’s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option. Apple could ultimately team up with another company, including OpenAI, or several.\n\nGoogle has raced to weave AI into its products, but the company has been dogged by concerns that it’s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft. Last month, the company pulled an image generator amid a flurry of criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. A deal with Apple would be Google’s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date and could be a major boon for the company’s AI efforts. Apple has more than 2 billion devices in active use that could potentially become home to Google Gemini later this year.\n\nPushing Google’s AI tools to as many devices as possible could help make them the ones users turn to reflexively, as they do with the company’s search engine, creating a virtuous cycle whereby the programs become sharper and sharper with additional user data. Earlier this year, Google struck a deal with Samsung Electronics Co. to incorporate its Gemini technology into the South Korean company’s phones, offering a glimpse of how Google could leverage its relationships with Android device manufacturers in the age of generative AI.\n\nIndustry observers expect tech companies to continue collaborating and investing in startups to augment their services and avoid being disrupted. “They need each other, especially in a space like AI which requires engineering expertise and lots of computing power,” said Dan Wang, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship. “It’s a sensible way for the large tech companies to spread out the risk.” No one, he added, “has really found a killer application just yet that people are willing to pay for.”\n\n--With assistance from Mark Bergen, Mark Gurman and Julia Love.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the worst English accents in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Worst English Accents in the World.\n\nEnglish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, with approximately 1.5 billion speakers around the globe. It is recognized as an international business language and is taught as a mandatory skill in most of the countries. According to a report by The University of Winnipeg, 142 countries worldwide teach English as a mandatory element of their national curriculums. Moreover, 41 countries treat it as a popular foreign language.\n\nSpeaking good English brings enhanced business opportunities and attracts growth and profitability. According to a survey conducted by EF English First, business customers were willing to pay 16% extra to a supplier with a high level of English proficiency. On the other hand, 53% of the respondents view organizations without a good grasp of English as unprofessional. In addition, the subsequent research on the survey found that a high level of English proficiency could help grow your business by 31% in 5 years.\n\nEconomic Analysis of Countries with the Best English Accent\n\nAccording to data, the United States, the United Kingdom, and European countries have the best English accents. These highly proficient English-speaking countries are also recognized as some of the world's most advanced economies.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Outlook Report 2024 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth in the advanced economies is projected to slow down slightly to 1.6% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024 before rising again to 1.8% in 2025. In the United States, growth is anticipated to decline from 2.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, attributed to stringent fiscal and monetary policies and a deceleration in aggregate demand within the labor market. On the other hand, the economic growth in the euro region is expected to recover from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.9% in 2024, finally reaching 1.7% in 2025. The resilient comeback of the European economy is due to strong household consumption after a drop in inflation and oil prices and an improvement in real income growth.

These growth projections are moderate due to the influence of persistently high energy prices within the UK. Nevertheless, declining inflation rates and an uptick in real income are key drivers fueling this economic expansion.\n\nKey Players Leading the Economy of the United States\n\nThe United States is one of the leading economies of the world and it is also one of the countries with the highest English proficiency. Foreigners from various countries learn English and move to the United States, seeking better employment opportunities. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the immigrant share of the total workforce in the United States reached an all-time high of 18.6% in 2023.

        "content": "Chinese officials decried the lack of “fairness” in the US last week following the swift passage of a House bill that called for Chinese company ByteDance to divest its popular social media app TikTok.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson for China accused the US of using national security as a guise to “willfully suppress other countries' superior companies,” strongly hinting that the Chinese government would block any forced sale of its most popular social media app.\n\nBut beyond preventing a spin-off, Chinese options for potential retaliation against the US remain limited, given the country’s current economic standing and its own policy of censorship, experts say.\n\n“The more that they take sort of retaliatory measures, that actually turbocharges that decoupling agenda that some have in Washington,” said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at The Peterson Institute for International Economics. “[That] would encourage firms to pull out of China because they wouldn't feel safe there.” Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, speaks to the press on March 13, 2024, after the ministry accused the US on Wednesday of bullying Tiktok. (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nChina weighs its options with TikTok\n\nThe latest congressional action marks another twist in a yearslong effort to limit the scale and influence of a social media app that has grown to more than 170 million users in the US.\n\nSince launching in 2017 as the international version of parent company ByteDance’s popular Chinese app Douyin, TikTok has become one of the most downloaded apps globally, along with Meta’s (META) Instagram.\n\nBut the vast amounts of data collected on the platform, as well as concerns about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to exert control over ByteDance, has raised the alarm for US lawmakers who have deemed TikTok’s ties to China a national security risk.\n\nIn congressional testimony, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has insisted that the company stores Americans' data in Virginia and Singapore, not China. However, the company later acknowledged there are some exceptions for creator data, as Forbes reported. Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, leaves a meeting in Sen. John Fetterman's office in the Russell Senate Office building on Thursday, March 14, 2024. (Bill Clark via Getty Images)\n\n“The Chinese government does have broad legal authorities to compel corporations in matters of national security,” said Colin Costello, a CFIUS and national security adviser at the Freshfields law firm. “So from the perspective of someone who views the Chinese government as an adversary and as a very capable adversary, the question is not has it been used, but can it be used? And the answer to that, ... from the perspective of the people who wrote this bill, is yes.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn't the first time Beijing has responded to threats of a US TikTok ban.\n\nIn 2020, after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively calling for the ban of TikTok and WeChat in the US, ByteDance immediately moved to update its export control rules. The changes restricted the export of “technology based on data analysis for personalized information recommendation service.”\n\nReva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, expects Beijing to intervene similarly if the Senate passes the House bill and President Joe Biden signs it into law to “demonstrate its own resistance to the US.” Visitors visit the TikTok booth at the Application & Electronics World Expo (AWE2024) in Shanghai, China, on March 14, 2024. (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nBut China’s own economic reality and a broad slowdown in foreign investments may also influence Beijing’s calculation in the scale of its response. Foreign direct investments in China fell to a 30-year low in 2023, weighed down in part by concerns over geopolitical tensions and an unpredictable business environment.\n\n“Beijing needs to weigh the risk of further alienating foreign investors when China’s economic challenges are already on full display,” Goujon said. “More defensive moves, whether on export controls, data security, or cybersecurity measures, will only drive companies deeper down the diversification path.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Beijing from responding in the past. Major American social media and online platforms, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Meta’s Facebook, and Snapchat (SNAP), have already been banned from the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe government also barred critical domestic infrastructure operators from purchasing Micron’s (MU) products last year, after Washington implemented export controls on key American components and chipmaking tools. Months later, China ordered employees at central government agencies to stop using Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, citing national security concerns.\n\nIf passed in the Senate, the TikTok bill sets a six-month deadline for TikTok to divest from ByteDance, a challenging scenario given the complexity of separating US assets from a global app.\n\nChorzempa said Beijing is unlikely to approve any deal, regardless of the price tag or corporate structure, in part because of what TikTok represents: a global social media success story made in China.\n\n“If Beijing is looking at a ban in the United States market compared to losing global control [over an app], it's not clear to me that it would prefer divestment and a payout for the existing shareholders over the loss of that channel,” Chorzempa said.\n\nIn part, he added, that's because the “abundance of Chinese actions in the last few years makes clear that the interests of shareholders and the financial interests of shareholders just do not come in very high on the list of Chinese government priorities.”\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Reddit IPO: The company is ready for more AI and advertising, says CEO",
        "content": "New investors shouldn't call Reddit (RDDT) an AI play even after a lucrative deal with tech beast Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nOr so says co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman.\n\n\"I think they should look at Reddit as a community platform that has many paths to success,\" Huffman told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, as his 19-year old company went public on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nReddit is pursuing more deals that feeds its data to large language models (LLMs), according to Huffman, but the company is also aiming to grab a bigger piece of the advertising pie.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 late Wednesday, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation initially.\n\nThe targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion valuation it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nAs of 12:15 p.m. ET, Reddit shares hadn't yet opened for trading. Indications had it opening in the $42 to $48 a share range.\n\nReddit is the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nThe Road to the Reddit IPO\n\nIt's been a long-winding road for Huffman — an avid ballroom dancer in his college days — and the Reddit team to reach its Thursday IPO.\n\nThe company — which Huffman frequently says is not a social media platform but a democratic community — was founded by Huffman and friend Alexis Ohanian in 2005.\n\nThe pair sold Reddit to Conde Nast a year later for a reported $10 million. Huffman stayed on until his contract ended in 2009. Ohanian left in 2010. Welcome to public markets, Reddit. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nConde Nast's parent company Advance Publications spun off the business in 2011. After churning through two CEOs, Reddit brought back Ohanian as executive chairman in 2014, then Huffman as CEO a year later.\n\nSince then, Huffman has waded into hot button content moderation topics on the platform, run the business during the meme stock uprising, and pivoted the company to capitalize on advertising dollars.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, Reddit struck a $60 million deal to license its data to help train Google's LLMs. The potential for more AI licensing deals were a key pitch to investors during its IPO roadshow.\n\nOhanian left in 2020, noting he wanted his board seat given to a diverse candidate. Interestingly, mentions of him were left out of Reddit's prospectus.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit has never turned a profit. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million. Its daily users tally about 73 million strong.\n\n\"I like the trend we are on,\" Huffman said when asked if adjusted profits achieved in late 2023 would continue in 2024. He declined to say if Reddit would be profitable in 2024.\n\nOther facts to know:\n\nAI kingmaker Sam Altman and Chinese tech giant Tencent are Reddit’s fourth and second largest shareholders, respectively. Huffman’s total 2023 compensation stood at $193.2 million, which includes $93.7 million in options awards and $98.3 million in stock awards. Key call out from its SEC filing: “Our Chief Executive Officer, Steven Huffman, holds 662,447 PRSUs for shares of our Class B common stock that are issuable upon achievement of a vesting condition that will be deemed satisfied based on our attaining a $5.0 billion market capitalization valuation following this offering.” The GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) meme stock trading saga was mentioned in the company’s risk factor section. 1.76 million shares were reserved for the Reddit user base to buy.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are set to face full-blown European Union investigations into their compliance with a new law reining in the power of Big Tech, paving the way for potentially hefty fines.\n\nThe European Commission is gearing up to announce probes into the firms’ compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple and Google’s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers will come under the EU’s focus, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA proposal from Meta Platforms Inc. to leverage a monthly fee on users for accessing Facebook and Instagram could also garner future EU scrutiny under the bloc’s new powers, the people added.\n\nThe heightened EU scrutiny against Apple comes as the US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general sued the firm on Thursday, accusing the iPhone maker of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.\n\nThe DMA — which lays out a series of dos and dont’s for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows the bloc to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations, regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.\n\nThe commission in Brussels declined to comment. Apple, Google and Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) EU fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.\n\nSpotify, which triggered the initial EU complaint over the App Store, said Apple’s DMA proposals to levy additional charges on developers were “unacceptable” and “nonsensical” and requested a meeting with the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager. Apple had proposed to scrap the 30% commission it has historically imposed, but also added new charges.\n\n—With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple was on Thursday sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, the latest antitrust action against Big Tech firms accused by regulators of operating monopolies and abusing their power.\n\nThe case is the fifth by the U.S. government aimed at reining in tech giants. Below are some such actions and other lawsuits:\n\nAPPLE\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has been probing Apple since 2019 and alleged on Thursday that the company has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing.\n\nThe California-based firm is also under regulatory scrutiny in Europe and was earlier this month hit with a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through restrictions on its App Store.\n\nApple is appealing the penalty but faces more scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Markets Act — new rules for Big Tech that went into effect earlier this month.\n\nOther lawsuits include a class action filed on March 1 in San Jose, California federal court accusing the company of monopolizing the market for cloud storage in its mobile devices.\n\nALPHABET\n\nThe evidentiary phase of a court battle between Google and the U.S. government wrapped up in November. In the trial, which started on Sept. 12, the Justice Department sought to prove that Google is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.\n\nThe case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in tech giants.\n\nGoogle was in February hit with a 2.1-billion-euro lawsuit by 32 media groups including Axel Springer and Schibsted, alleging that they had suffered losses due to the company's practices in digital advertising. Last month, Google also asked a U.S. judge to throw out a jury verdict in a lawsuit by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games that found the technology giant had abused its market dominance in setting rules for its app store. Epic Games had prevailed in the high-profile antitrust trial that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA PLATFORMS\n\nAn appeals court ruled earlier this month that Meta cannot stop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission from reopening a probe into its Facebook unit's privacy practices for now. The company had objected, citing the $5 billion fine it paid and range of safeguards it had agreed.\n\nIn October, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta and its Instagram unit, accusing them of fueling a youth mental health crisis by making their social media platforms addictive.\n\nThe company was hit with a record 1.2 billion euro fine by its lead European Union privacy regulator in May 2023 over its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the U.S.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com in September, charging the company with harming consumers with higher prices.\n\nThe FTC has also filed other lawsuits against the company, including one accusing the e-commerce giant of duping \"millions of consumers\" into purchasing subscriptions for Prime services.\n\n($1 = 0.9178 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G, Jaspreet Singh and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now for Less than $1,000",
        "content": "If you're sitting on some extra cash, there's not a better time to consider putting that money to work in the stock market. Leading tech companies like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have reported improving growth over the last year, but these companies have great prospects in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAn investor with less than $1,000 could buy at least one share of each stock right now. Here's why these two companies are no-brainer investments.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nOver the last 10 years, shares of Alphabet knocked it out of the park for investors, as the company rode strong tailwinds in the digital advertising market. The stock has returned 147% over the last five years and is sitting close to new highs as the online advertising market recovers from the macroeconomic headwinds, but the market still underestimates Google's advantages in data and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe stock offers an attractive valuation to get started with a new investment. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21. This ratio suggests the stock is quite affordable, especially given the company's recent earnings growth (it was up 27% in 2023 and is expected to rise another 17% in 2024).\n\nAlphabet should maintain strong growth. It has an advantage with lots of data from billions of users that rely on Google products. This will enable the company to make its Gemini AI model smarter and create sophisticated tools for content creators on YouTube, and importantly, advertisers.\n\nAI will also drive demand for Google Cloud, which is starting to turn a profit after years of losses. The cloud business is turning the corner financially while seeing demand for generative AI services. Top brands recently expanded their relationship with Google Cloud, including McDonald's and Verizon Communications.\n\nFor these reasons, the stock is a no-brainer buy in 2024.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon stock has been an outstanding performer for investors. Strong growth in the company's online retail and cloud businesses sent the stock soaring over the last decade, and it's currently up 101% in just the last five years. Following the stock's steep decline in 2022, it is on the rebound and could have significant upside as growth across the business starts to pick up again.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's most impressive about Amazon's performance right now is that management is squeezing more profit out of the business while still doing the same things that built the brand over the last two decades. It's adding more value for customers with same-day delivery and keeping retail prices competitive while posting a whopping 383% year-over-year increase in operating profit in 2023's fourth quarter.\n\nIn fact, Amazon generated record operating profit of $36.8 billion last year, and management previously mentioned it's still finding ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the retail business.\n\nAmazon still has several areas outside of retail to deliver returns to shareholders. Online and physical stores made up only 43% of Amazon's total revenue last year. The rest came from growing revenue streams in high-margin businesses like advertising, subscriptions, third-party seller services, and the Amazon Web Services cloud business.\n\nAmazon could grow its profits substantially over the next decade. It still has a significant runway for growth in global e-commerce and cloud services. These opportunities can allow Amazon to reach $100 billion in operating profit within the next 10 years. That would push the stock's value higher, making the shares a no-brainer investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL division Google revealed a few of its latest AI-backed efforts to deepen its penetration into the multi-trillion healthcare industry at its annual health event, which took place in New York City.\r\n\r\nReportedly, a new AI feature powered by the company’s advanced AI model called Gemini is being developed by Google Research and Fitbit. The feature will help train Fitbit users on their personal health by leveraging data collected from their wristbands.\r\n\r\nFurther, the search giant intends to provide AI-powered screenings for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer in India in collaboration with Apollo Radiology International. This initiative, which is currently subject to regulatory approvals, is meant to deliver 3 million free scans over the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also making efforts to enhance health information on its search engine and YouTube.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle’s Aggressive Stance on Healthcare\n\nThe latest initiatives are in sync with Alphabet’s aggressive efforts to revolutionize the healthcare industry with the help of AI.\r\n\r\nApart from these endeavors, Google recently launched Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, a generative AI-powered tool intended for the healthcare industry. The tool utilizes generative AI to assist clinicians search for information from patient notes, scanned documents and other clinical data. The tool's understanding of medical terminology and specific data points provides transparency and reduces hallucinations.\r\n\r\nFurther, the company’s launch of MedLM, a family of generative AI models designed for the healthcare industry, remains a major positive. These models offer medical documentation testing, drug development research and chatbot provider identification.\r\n\r\nGoogle intends to expand MedLM capabilities with MedLM for Chest X-rays to help with their classification for operational, screening and diagnostics use cases, and a Condition Summary feature to enhance task-specific API capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe company also offers Healthcare Data Engine, which provides interoperable patient data and clinical insights in FHIR format.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned endeavors will aid the company in capitalizing on the growing demand for generative AI in the healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nPer a Global Market Insights report, generative AI in the healthcare market is expected to reach $22.1 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 32.6% between 2024 and 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Precedence Research Report shows that the market is expected to hit $21.74 billion by 2032, seeing a CAGR of 35.1% over 2023-2032.\n\nRising Competition\n\nAlphabet, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has intensified the healthcare battle with its above-mentioned efforts for its peers like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL, which are also making concerted efforts to expand their footprints in the promising healthcare space.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Amazon’s extended collaboration with Philips to improve digital workflow integration and AI/ML capabilities in pathology labs and healthcare organizations with the support of its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis partnership will enhance digital pathology solutions, enabling labs to efficiently manage and analyze growing data, optimize workflows and integrate with existing healthcare systems for holistic patient care.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft’s partnership with Epic, which is about developing and integrating generative AI into healthcare by combining the scale and power of Azure OpenAI Service with the latter’s electronic health record (EHR) software, is a positive.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure’s introduction of the latest capabilities to free up clinicians' information, including patient timelines and clinical report simplification using generative AI, enabling healthcare professionals to extract and organize unstructured data for better understanding, is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nOracle recently enhanced its Health Data Intelligence suite by introducing a generative AI service to boost care management efficiency.

If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\n\nA victory for the US in this case \"would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,\" Apple added in its statement.\n\nApple's stock was down roughly 3% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.\n\nThe filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws. Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Loren Elliott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nThe DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start to 2024.\n\nShares of Apple are down 7% year-to-date, as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title of the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on Twitter @alexiskweed.\n\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Apple has kept an illegal monopoly over smartphones in US, Justice Department says in antitrust suit",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors and stifles innovation.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone market and uses its control over the iPhone to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.”\n\nThe lawsuit — which was also filed with 16 state attorneys general — is the latest example of the Justice Department’s approach to aggressive enforcement of federal antitrust law that officials say is aimed at ensuring a fair and competitive market, even as it has lost some significant anticompetition cases.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce antitrust statutes. The increased policing of corporate mergers and business deals has been met with resistance from some business leaders who have said the Democratic administration is overreaching, but it’s been lauded by others as long overdue.\n\nThe case is taking direct aim at the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has assiduously built around the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch to create what is often referred to as a “walled garden” so its meticulously designed hardware and software can seamlessly flourish together while requiring consumers to do little more than turn the devices on.\n\nThe strategy has helped make Apple the world’s most prosperous company, with annual revenue of nearly $400 billion and, until recently, a market value of more than $3 trillion. But Apple’s shares have fallen by 7% this year even as most of the stock market has climbed to new highs, resulting in long-time rival Microsoft — a target of a major Justice Department antitrust case a quarter-century ago — to seize the mantle as the world’s most valuable company.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has defended the walled garden as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has described the barrier as a way for the iPhone to distinguish itself from devices running on Google’s Android software, which isn’t as restrictive and is licensed to a wide range of manufacturers.\n\nFears about an antitrust crackdown on Apple’s business model have contributed to the drop in the company’s stock price, along with concerns that it is lagging Microsoft and Google in the push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence technology.\n\nBut antitrust regulators made it clear in their complaint that they see Apple's walled garden most as a weapon to ward off competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices that have propelled its lofty profit margins while stifling innovation.\n\n“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.”\n\nWith the attempt to rein in Apple's dominance, the Biden administration is escalating an antitrust siege that has already triggered lawsuits against Google and Amazon accusing them in engaging in illegal tactics to thwart competition, as well as unsuccessful attempts to block acquisitions by Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.\n\nApple's business interests are also entangled in the Justice Department's case against Google, which went to trial last fall and is headed toward final arguments scheduled to begin May 1 in Washington, D.C. In that case, regulators are alleging Google has stymied competition by paying for the rights for its already dominant online search engine to be the automatic place to handle queries on the iPhone and a variety of web browsers in an arrangement that generates an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually.\n\nNow that the Justice Department is mounting a direct attack across its business, Apple stands to lose even more.\n\nThe Justice Department is following up an other recent attempts to force Apple to change the way it runs the iPhone and other parts of its business.\n\nEpic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in 2020 in an effort break down the barriers protecting the iPhone App Store and a lucrative payment system operating within it. Apple has long collected commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within apps, a setup that Epic alleged was enabled by an illegal monopoly that drives up prices for consumers.\n\nAfter a monthlong trial in 2021, a federal judge ruled mostly in favor of Apple with the exception of deciding that links to competing payment options should be permitted inside of iPhone apps. Apple unsuccessfully resisted that portion of the ruling until the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in January, forcing the company to relent. But the concessions that Apple made to comply with the ruling are still facing a “bad faith” challenge from Epic, which is seeking an April 30 hearing to ask U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to order more changes.\n\nApple also had to open up the iPhone to allow apps to be downloaded and installed from competing stores in Europe to comply with a new set of regulators called the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, earlier this month but its approach is being pilloried by critics as little more than an end-around the rules that will enable it to continue to muscle out real competition. European Union regulators already have vowed to crack down on Apple if it finds the company's tactics continue to thwart true consumer choice.\n\nAll of this comes on top of a $2 billion (1.8 billion euro) fine that European regulators slapped on Apple earlier this month after concluding that the company had undermined competition in the music streaming through the iPhone, despite Spotify being the leader in that market.\n\n___\n\nLiedtke reported from San Francisco.",

        "content": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share price has soared 153% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's even up 6.4% in the last week.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Alphabet will grow revenue in the future.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before forming an opinion on Alphabet you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the AI movement\n\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\n\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\n\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\n\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander piled into the \"Magnificent Seven\" of AI stocks\n\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\n\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass added shares of time-tested AI businesses that would be AI-bubble resistant\n\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\n\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\n\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen gobbled up AI ancillary stocks in place of Nvidia\n\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\n\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\n\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\n\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing doesn't always have to be about finding the next big thing. Sometimes, buying and holding what's already a great business is the better option in the technology space. Some companies dominate technology and have the size and deep pockets to protect their interests from competition.\n\nThese megacap tech stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, have turned individual investors into millionaires.\n\nCan that continue? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is a table-pounding buy today.\n\nHere are the three that are:\n\n1. Nvidia: AI chip dominance spells a bright future\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The reason? It became the go-to AI chip company, enjoying a market share between 80% and 90% today. That's launched the stock upward by a blistering 500% since the start of 2023. Today, Nvidia's $2.1 trillion market cap makes it one of the largest corporations on the planet. So, how can the party keep going? Believe it or not, Nvidia still has millionaire-making potential over the long term.\n\nCompanies worldwide are implementing AI into their products and services. AI is certainly no fluke. The more AI spreads, the higher the demand for powerful data centers to power it. Nvidia's CEO believes there is a need for over a trillion dollars in additional data center spending over the coming years. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's chief rival, believes the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion.\n\nIf you annualized Nvidia's fourth-quarter data center revenue, the resulting $72 billion is a fraction of the potential market. Even if competition eats away at Nvidia's market share, it's hard to see a collapse. Suppose market share falls to 50%. Half of a $400 billion market is still three times Nvidia's annualized Q4 data center revenue. In other words, Nvidia's AI growth trend could continue for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nNumbers-wise, analysts believe Nvidia will grow earnings by an average of 30% annually over the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37 today, arguably cheap for a company with such high expected growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: The social media giant with room to run\n\nUnder Co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has become the king of social media. Today, nearly 4 billion people use any one of Meta's four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp each month. A social media company doesn't jump out as an AI stock, but Meta is very much one. The company makes its money by advertising to its billions of users.\n\nAI is behind the scenes, choosing which content to show users to maximize their time and engagement on the app. It's helping advertisers craft compelling ads and finding the best users to show them to. Zuckerberg is also passionate about Reality Labs, an AI and metaverse business unit investing billions of dollars in research and development of augmented reality hardware and other technologies.\n\nMeta's user base grew by 6% in 2023, an impressive feat considering it grew from such a large base. This shows how good Meta Platforms is at social media, and it could grow even more potent if the United States takes action to ban TikTok because of owner ByteDance's ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Meta is a cash cow repurchasing shares and has just started paying investors dividends.\n\nMeanwhile, shares trade at a forward P/E of 24, an attractive price tag for a business that experts believe can grow earnings by 20% annually for the next three to five years. Shareholders are poised to enjoy billions of dollars raining down on them for dividends and repurchases, making Meta a potentially potent millionaire-maker.\n\n3. Alphabet: Don't count this stock out when it comes to AI\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has dominated internet search for two decades. The company maintains a roughly 90% share of global searches, making Google the world's most trafficked website. Second place? Video search platform YouTube, owned by ... you guessed it, Alphabet. The two sites create lucrative advertising opportunities, the golden goose that Alphabet has ridden to a trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nThere is some fear that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots could disrupt Google Search and cripple Alphabet's lucrative empire. However, don't rush to count Alphabet out. The company has launched AI tools of its own, and Google benefits from 20 years of brand power. Google is synonymous with internet search, and that won't be easy to change overnight.\n\nRemember that Alphabet is still one of the most influential companies on Earth. It generates $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies do in sales. It's not impossible, but breaching Alphabet's moat won't be easy.\n\nToday, shares trade at a forward P/E of 21, while analysts expect 16% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years. That makes Alphabet a potential bargain if it can ward off the pressure from ChatGPT and other rivals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 best cities for cyber security jobs in the world. We have also discussed the growing demand in the field. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World.\n\nThe cybersecurity field is growing at an unprecedented scale as cybercrimes have increased by 300% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This number is shedding light on the urgency of building strong defenses against online threats that has fuelled a 32% projected increase in cybersecurity jobs over the next decade. Presently, there are nearly 600,000 unfilled cybersecurity positions in the United States alone which confirms that there is an immense demand for skilled professionals in the industry.\n\nMoreover, the UK has also decided to double its investment in overseas cyber security projects, confirming the increasing seriousness of cyber threats. With an increase in spending to £25mn ($32.02) in 2022-23, the government shows the understanding of the pressing need to fortify global digital defenses.\n\nDespite misconceptions about the field's exclusivity, cybersecurity offers high-paying opportunities without the need for a bachelor's degree. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s initiative, Grow with Google, aims to address this gap by providing accessible online training in cybersecurity and other high-demand skills. With programs like these, individuals can acquire valuable certifications in as little as 3 months, setting them on a path to secure, well-compensated employment in cybersecurity.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that several specialized areas tend to offer lucrative compensation in the cyber security field due to their high demand and the level of expertise required. Among these, roles such as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security architects, and penetration testers often command the highest salaries.\n\nThe field of cybersecurity is not attractive solely because of the high salaries, in fact, the field also offers the flexibility of remote work and the satisfaction of combating digital threats across different sectors, including finance, healthcare, and government. Salaries in the field often exceed $100,000, with some remote positions offering upwards of $200,000 annually. Speaking of salaries, Virginia and California are the highest paying states for cyber security professionals, making them the best states for cyber security jobs. To read more about high-paying remote jobs, see the remote jobs that pay atleast $50 an hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2024, cybersecurity predictions point to an increase in AI-generated threats. Even though large language models have revolutionized organizational cybersecurity, limitations have made it necessary to shift towards specialized, smaller models. Threat actors are expected to exploit AI development through sophisticated phishing campaigns and deepfakes. Furthermore, according to the World Economic Forum, there's an anticipated spike in third-party data breaches, accentuated by a 72% increase observed in 2023. Consequently, organizations must fortify their cybersecurity posture by scrutinizing not only their practices but also those of their vendors.\n\nIn order to combat and raise awareness about the serious cyber threats, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its cybersecurity research center in Tokyo on March 7, 2024, aiming to improve security in the Asia-Pacific region. Situated in Tokyo's Roppongi district, the center will engage in cybersecurity policy discussions, educational initiatives, resource development, and research collaborations with Japanese institutions. Covering 13 countries, it serves as an Asia-Pacific hub for (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s cybersecurity efforts. The initiative coincides with Japan's \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month,\" highlighting how the country is committed to enhancing online security. With rising cyber threats, including government-targeted attacks and incidents like the Port of Nagoya ransomware attack, Japan is also actively working on its efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure and promote regional collaboration.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) have announced an expanded strategic partnership aimed at enhancing clients' cybersecurity capabilities. This collaboration signifies the importance of unified efforts in tackling evolving security threats. With this partnership, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) aim to provide end-to-end security solutions to clients. Notably, the partnership will focus on two critical areas: modernizing security operations and securing cloud transformations.\n\nThis joint venture will essentially capitalize on advanced AI and automation technologies to provide clients with autonomous and advanced managed security operations. This includes 24x7 monitoring, investigation, and automated remediation of security alerts. Moreover, the partnership will facilitate clients' journey to the cloud by leveraging Prisma Cloud byPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) in conjunction with International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting services. 15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World\n\nA high-rise office building, its staff busy at work providing cybersecurity services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best cities for cyber security jobs in the world, we first identified 15 countries with the highest salaries for cyber security jobs.

        "title": "12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\n\nMoreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as \"very important,\" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\n\nCompanies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced \"new collar\" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.\n\nFurthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.\n\nAnother observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google on Thursday will seek to fend off criticism about changes to its core services mandated by landmark EU tech rules, according to a copy of a senior Google executive's speech seen by Reuters.\n\nOliver Bethell, a lawyer who leads Google's EMEA competition team, will tell regulators and rivals that balancing the various interests has required the tech company to make complex trade-offs, according to the document.\n\nUnder the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in on March 7, users can remove any Google pre-installed software or app if they want while Google will need their consent to use their data across its various services or for personalised ads.\n\nGoogle is not allowed to favour its services or products over rivals on its platform.\n\nThe DMA aims to rein in Big Tech’s power, ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals and give users more choices. The Act designates companies that control access to their platforms, such as Google, as a gatekeeper.\n\nRivals ranging from comparison shopping sites to hotels, airlines and restaurants have said the changes made by Google do not comply with the DMA and have urged the European Commission to act. Some rivals have complained that Google's search traffic results are even worse than prior to the changes.\n\nBethell says in the speech that re-wiring the company's search engine has been a balancing act.\n\n\"We need to balance the new opportunities 6(11) is intended to create with the risk to user privacy and security,\" Bethell will tell a workshop organised by the European Commission to allow rivals and other interested parties to quiz the company. Six/11 refers to a DMA article.\n\n\"The balance requires complex trade-offs,\" Bethell says in the document. \"There is a question of when do we go too far by giving online search engines sensitive information at a high cost to users.\"\n\nBethell said some changes demanded by vertical search engines went beyond the DMA.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We heard some calls for changes from stakeholders that we think would fundamentally degrade Search for European users and businesses, that are not required by the DMA and that we can't implement,\" he said.\n\n\"The DMA should not require a degraded search experience on Google for European consumers.\"\n\nBethell also took a swipe at other companies designated as gatekeepers under the DMA which have faced criticism over their compliance efforts.\n\n\"As we comply with the DMA, engage with the Commission, and listen to feedback from third parties, we expect the same from other gatekeepers too,\" he said.\n\nDMA breaches can cost companies as much as 10% of their annual global turnover.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "(Adds details from decision, comments from lawyers, paragraphs 5-20)\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday declined to sanction Michael Cohen, the former fixer for Donald Trump, for mistakenly giving his lawyer fake case citations generated by artificial intelligence, calling the episode \"embarrassing.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan also refused to end court-supervised release for Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and tax evasion and served time in prison, and suggested Cohen may have perjured himself.\n\nFurman's decision came as Cohen prepares to be a star witness against Trump in the former president's upcoming criminal trial in Manhattan.\n\nTrump had pleaded not guilty to 34 criminal counts for covering hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels to aid his successful 2016 presidential run.\n\nThe 2024 Republican presidential candidate and his campaign have long portrayed Cohen as a serial liar, and Furman's decision could add fuel to that portrayal.\n\n'UNFORTUNATE EPISODE'\n\nThe citations to three nonexistent cases that Cohen, a former lawyer who has been disbarred, generated through Alphabet's Google Bard appeared in a filing seeking to end his supervised release before November.\n\nCohen's lawyer, David Schwartz, submitted the filing after his client sought feedback from another lawyer, Danya Perry.\n\nSchwartz said he believed the citations came from Perry, and citing her reputation as a \"renowned and skilled trial lawyer\" did not check their accuracy. He and Cohen later apologized.\n\nIn his decision, Furman called Schwartz's conduct \"certainly negligent, perhaps even grossly negligent,\" but found no evidence of bad faith to justify sanctions. He also did not question Cohen's original belief that the cases were real.\n\nBut the judge said that given the publicity surrounding AI, it was surprising Cohen thought Google Bard was a \"super-charged search engine\" and not a \"generative text service\" such as ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As embarrassing as this unfortunate episode was for Schwartz, if not Cohen, the record does not support the imposition of sanctions,\" Furman wrote.\n\nBarry Kamins, a lawyer for Schwartz, said he was gratified by the finding of no bad faith.\n\nOther lawyers have also used fake citations generated by AI.\n\nIn his year-end report on the judiciary, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said using AI requires \"caution and humility,\" and called citing nonexistent cases in court papers \"always a bad idea.\"\n\nWALKING AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIn seeking to end his supervised release, Cohen said his recent testimony in New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil fraud case against Trump demonstrated his \"exceptional level of remorse and a commitment to upholding the law.\"\n\nBut the judge said Cohen's testimony that he had lied when pleading guilty to tax evasion meant he had committed perjury when entering what plea, or committed perjury when testifying against Trump.\n\n\"Cohen's ongoing and escalating efforts to walk away from his prior acceptance of responsibility for his crimes are manifest evidence of the ongoing need for specific deterrence,\" Furman wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Perry called the absence of sanctions against Cohen an \"important win,\" but disputed Furman's characterization of Cohen's testimony, noting that the judge in the civil fraud case wrote \"Michael Cohen told the truth.\"\n\nPerry added: \"Defendants often feel compelled to agree to coercive plea deals under severe pressure. That is exactly what happened to Mr. Cohen.\"\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan, who opposed ending Cohen's supervised release, declined to comment.

Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.\r\n\r\nThis will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs.\r\n\r\nApart from this, AWS intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU. These EC2 instances will feature the new B100 GPUs, which will be deployed in EC2 UltraClusters to accelerate generative AI training and inference.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Blackwell will be integrated with AWS Nitro System, Elastic Fabric Adapter encryption and AWS Key Management Service. This will help in providing end-to-end control of the training data and model weights.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon SageMaker will be integrated with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices as part of this collaboration to aid the price performance optimization of foundation models running on GPUs.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength, Competitive Scenario\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon’s concerted efforts to expand the AWS portfolio, which has been driving its cloud customer momentum. Moreover, AWS's strength has been acting as a key catalyst behind Amazon’s growth. AMZN shares have returned 74.9% over a year.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s solid customer base, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. The Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nThe extended collaboration with NVIDIA is in sync with Amazon’s growing efforts toward bolstering its generative AI.\r\n\r\nAWS’s announcement regarding the general availability of its fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which provides seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google added a new Transit feature to Google Maps for Wear OS, offering users public transit directions.\r\n\r\nNotably, this Transit option for location searches works with Wear OS Tile for quick travel, providing an ETA after driving, walking and biking.\r\n\r\nFurther, users can access a live map view, zoomed-out map view and exit icon on the watch face when selecting a route in Google Maps.\r\n\r\nThe latest move will likely boost the adoption of Wear OS. Moreover, the company is expected to gain solid traction across smartwatch users on the back of this new feature.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will enable Alphabet to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global smartwatch market. Per an EMR report, the global smartwatch market is expected to be valued at $160.67 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 15.6% between 2024 and 2032.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle Maps in Focus\n\nApart from the latest feature for Wear OS, the company also announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map. This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.\r\n\r\nFurther, Google added \"glanceable directions\" for Maps on Android and iOS, providing live ETAs and directions on the device's lock screen, using regular system notifications.\r\n\r\nThe company has also updated Google Maps on Android Auto to display estimated drive time in a bolder font, similar to other platforms. The bolder number, now displayed alongside thinner minutes and hour indicators, is available in version 11.119.0100 of Google Maps and version 11.5 of Android Auto.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital map market. Per a Future Market Insights report, the global digital map market is expected to reach $73.1 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2033.\r\n\r\nMoreover, growing Google Maps efforts will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.48 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nStrengthening Google Maps offerings will aid Alphabet to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which have positioned themselves well in the digital map space.\r\n\r\nApple is riding on the success of its Apple Maps offerings.\r\n\r\nApple’s launch of Apple Business Connect, a free tool enabling businesses to manage their location place cards and customize information for over a billion users on Apple Maps, including adding photos, logos and promotions, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is enjoying the growing momentum of Bing Maps with new feature updates.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft introduced live traffic updates on Bing Maps, enabling users to plan their journeys more efficiently by providing real-time information about traffic conditions during commutes.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "Google becomes the first AI company to be fined over training data",
        "content": "Nearly five years ago, I reported on how France’s news publishers had gone to war with Google over the issue of “ancillary copyright” fees—payments for including snippets of article text in Google’s search results. I wrote that the media houses were unlikely to win. Well, they just did. And as with everything else these days, AI suddenly became part of the equation.\n\nThis morning, the French competition authority fined Google €250 million ($271 million) for failing to comply with commitments it made a couple years ago regarding how it would negotiate the fees with the French news outlets. Google already received a €500 million fine over the matter in 2021. It’s not arguing back this time, which has probably spared it an even higher fine.\n\nI’m not going to go into the details of the revised negotiation process to which Google has agreed—it’s as dull as it sounds and, if you really want to dive in, here’s Google’s statement in French and English. The interesting part of this episode is about Google’s Bard AI, which these days goes by the name of Gemini.\n\nAs far as I’m aware, this is the first fine to be levied on an AI company at least partially because of its free-wheeling incorporation of everything it can grab into its training data.\n\nAccording to the French Competition Authority (FCA) the fine takes account of the fact that Google “used content from press agencies and publishers to train its [Bard] foundation model, without notifying either them or the [FCA].”\n\nAs Google tells it, the FCA “does not challenge the way web content is used to improve newer products like generative AI.” Google claimed this issue is “already addressed” in Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive, which provides an exception for text and data mining, and in the upcoming EU AI Act, which tells AI companies to respect the Copyright Directive (and to publish “sufficiently detailed” summaries of their training data).\n\nBut according to the FCA, the question of whether article-scraping AI companies qualify for that text and data mining exception “has not yet been settled.” It said Google had “at the very least” broken its commitment to be transparent in its commercial dealings with French news publishers, making this a fining matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, Google did recently launch a new control in the robots.txt file that web publishers use to send signals to Google’s web crawlers. The setting is called Google-Extended, and it’s supposed to let publishers opt out of having their data become Bard/Gemini training fodder without also having their articles disappear from Google Search and Google News.\n\nBut it only added that control at the end of September, more than two months after Bard’s European launch. During that period, French publishers effectively had to allow the unrestricted hoovering of their output into Bard if they also wanted it to appear in Search and News—which, remember, is how they then get to claim ancillary copyright fees from Google. That broke another of Google’s commitments, again contributing to today’s fine. The FCA also told Google to explain to publishers how the opt-out mechanism works.\n\nSo in summary, Google’s new control for publishers has belatedly fixed one of the issues with the unpaid incorporation of news articles into its AI training material, but the overall legality of this practice under EU copyright law remains an open question. It’s not hard to see why Google's big rival, OpenAI, has started cutting licensing deals with European press publishers like Axel Springer and Le Monde.\n\nOne final note while we’re on the subject of Big Tech and European antitrust regulators: Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition chief, just told Reuters that Apple may face a probe over the €0.50-per-app-installation “core technology fee” it’s levying on developers who dare to use the third-party iOS app stores that Apple must allow under the new EU Digital Markets Act. “There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA,” she said.\n\nGiven that Microsoft and Meta have both complained to Vestager that the fee makes third-party app stores unviable, there’s a storm a-coming, and I do not hate to say I told you so. More news below—and by the way, the Data Sheet team offers our red-cheeked apologies for misspelling “Nvidia” in yesterday’s email subject line…\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Their so-called neighboring rights were targeted as part of the European Union’s 2019 Copyright Directive.\n\nThe German antitrust authority previously ditched an investigation into Google’s News Showcase service after the company settled its concerns. In 2014, Google withdrew its News service from Spain after the country adopted laws that allow Spanish publications to charge Google for publishing snippets to their work.

        "title": "Apple-Google Gemini Partnership Could Make an Unstoppable AI Force",
        "content": "Google’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), shot higher yesterday, finishing the day up 4.6%, following a Bloomberg report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to Google Gemini as the AI integrated into the iPhone. Indeed, a potential Apple-Google Gemini partnership in artificial intelligence (AI) could mirror their deal with search, which was the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny in recent years.\n\nAnd while a Google-Apple AI partnership is sure to draw the ire of antitrust regulators, I see the move as a potentially massive win for both companies as they seek to gain (further) in the AI race.\n\nWith Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the charge on generative AI with its OpenAI stake, Apple must find a way to make up for lost time on the AI front. Teaming up with Google is a way to catch up with industry leaders like Microsoft. Also, it may be a straightforward way to pull ahead as Apple gains access to one of the most potent large language models (LLMs), Google Gemini. Given this, I remain bullish on both AAPL and GOOGL.\n\nApple: Teaming Up with an AI Powerhouse Could Prove Wise\n\nWhile I’m sure Apple could incorporate its own LLM into its devices, I think Google is the better option at this early phase in the AI boom. Why? As good as LLMs have become in recent quarters, they’re still not immune from hallucinating (making stuff up, seemingly out of the blue).\n\nOnly time will tell when we have a robust, hallucination-free LLM ready for the market. Regardless, given Apple’s history of releasing polished products that are truly ready for takeoff, I just don’t see Apple putting itself out there with a work-in-progress type of LLM product.\n\nAs capable and impressive as they are, even the latest versions of Google Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo are technically works in progress, at least in my opinion.\n\nNeither LLM is perfect, especially at this point in the AI lifecycle, when hallucinations still happen regularly. My guess is it could take a while before LLMs are polished enough that mistakes become incredibly rare (or maybe virtually impossible).\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps we may be a few quarters or even a few years away from the error-free AI that many of us envision as a sort of holy grail in AI. Given how fast generative AI technologies are advancing (think exponential, not linear, rates), though, maybe hallucination-free LLMs are a heck of a lot closer than many of us may think.\n\nFor now, I think the masses have come to accept that the occasional hiccup is bound to happen when using even the best LLM that exists today. Users of such LLMs can simply check the sources themselves to ensure they’re not on the receiving end of a hallucination. Indeed, fact-checking can be a bit of a hassle when using LLMs like Gemini or GPT-4, but it’s a relatively small compromise. Further, it’s between that and using an old-fashioned search engine.\n\nWhat Could the Future Hold for the Google-Apple AI Partnership?\n\nI don’t think Apple has anything to really gain by rushing an LLM product to market right now, especially given that today’s LLMs are prone to errors, negative headlines, lawsuits, public outrage, and all sorts of negativity.\n\nWhen the perfect time comes (perhaps when LLMs have a bit more polish), though, I think Apple could have the option to replace Google Gemini with its own LLM, just like when it gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot from Mac devices when it was ready to launch on the back of its very own Apple Silicon.\n\nIn these early stages of the AI boom, Apple stands to benefit from all the positives of AI by using Gemini without having to deal with the downsides. If something goes awry, it’s the Gemini LLM, not Apple, that’s to blame. In the meantime, look for Alphabet to gain traction as Gemini introduces itself to Apple’s golden install base, which is billions of users strong.\n\nIndeed, Gemini in iPhone could ultimately help Google and Apple surpass Microsoft in the LLM race. It will be interesting to see how a potential Google-Apple partnership evolves. Nevertheless, if any deal is inked, I expect that GOOGL stock could face a considerable valuation multiple expansion, perhaps one closer to that of its top AI peer, MSFT stock, even if Alphabet is forced to pay Apple a hefty sum.\n\nEven after surging 4.6% in a day, GOOGL stock still seems to have room to run at just 25.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) if it’s to catch up to MSFT stock’s 37.7 times trailing P/E multiple.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAlphabet stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Alphabet stock price target of $165.09 implies 12.3% upside potential.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nApple stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target of $204.86 implies 16.3% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt seems like a Google-Apple Gemini AI deal would be a win for both firms in a bid to pull ahead in the generative AI race. It’s important to note, however, that all we have is a report from Bloomberg about potential talks between the two companies.\n\nThe chatter about the chatter means that nothing is set in stone yet, even though recent market action suggests a dotted line has already been signed. In any case, look for Apple to go on the hunt for an AI partner as it seeks a “backstop” in this still-early (and less-than-polished) stage of generative AI.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Updates March 18 article to incorporate court decisions in additional lawsuits that name Meta, Snap among defendant companies that offer social media platforms)\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - Several social media companies were ordered by a New York state judge to face four lawsuits seeking to hold them responsible for helping enable the avowed white supremacist who killed 10 Black people in 2022 at a Buffalo, New York grocery store.\n\nJustice Paula Feroleto of the Erie County Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the more than 40 plaintiffs could try to prove that Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, Reddit, Google's YouTube and other platforms were designed to addict and radicalize users like the shooter, Payton Gendron.\n\nThe plaintiffs included relatives or representatives of people who died in Gendron's racially motivated mass shooting at Tops Friendly Markets on May 14, 2022, as well as store employees and customers who witnessed it. Gendron was 18 at the time.\n\nIn seeking dismissals, Meta, Reddit, YouTube and other defendants said they merely hosted third-party content and were not liable under a federal law governing such content, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nBut the judge said the plaintiffs could try to prove that the defendants owned them a duty because their platforms were defective and led to injuries.\n\nShe also said the mental distress that many witnesses suffered from the \"horrific\" attack was a \"special circumstance\" justifying the pursuit of negligence-based claims.\n\nIn a statement, Reddit said hate and violence \"have no place\" on its platform. It also said it constantly evaluates means to remove such content, and will continue reviewing communities to ensure they are upholding its rules.\n\nThe decision's timing appeared unrelated to Reddit's initial public offering, which is expected this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nYouTube spokesperson Jose Castaneda said that the platform disagreed with Feroleto's decision and will appeal.\n\nYouTube had \"deepest sympathies\" for attack victims and their families, and tries to find and remove extremist conduct while also working with law enforcement, he said.\n\nMeta and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuits seek unspecified civil damages.\n\n\"We must hold accountable every single bad actor that prepared and equipped the shooter to target and kill members of Buffalo's Black community,\" said Eric Tirschwell, executive director of the gun control advocacy group Everytown Law, which filed two of the lawsuits.\n\nOther defendants in the lawsuits include Alphabet, Google, Snap, retailers that allegedly sold firearm equipment and body armor to Gendron, and Gendron's parents.\n\nGendron pleaded guilty to charges including murder and terrorism motivated by hate, and was sentenced in February 2023 to life in prison without parole.\n\nHe also faces federal charges, and the U.S. Department of Justice said in January it plans to seek the death penalty.

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.57%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.83%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the internet search leader had gained 5.1% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.42%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.97%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.49, signifying a 27.35% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $65.95 billion, up 13.58% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.77 per share and a revenue of $286.48 billion, demonstrating changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.16% higher within the past month. Alphabet is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to valuation, Alphabet is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.8. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.52, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nWe can also see that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.36. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. GOOGL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.24 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, which puts it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nThe resurgence in US stocks, buoyed by what's been labeled the \"most-crowded trade,\" underscores the market's resilience. Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company's market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve's decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan's Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MAR)\n\nUpside Potential: 0.60%\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo analyst Jeffrey Donnelly affirmed his Equal-Weight rating for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) while increasing the price target from $234 to $250. This adjustment reflects Wells Fargo's updated assessment of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) valuation and prospects within the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) operates in the hospitality sector and is renowned for its global portfolio of hotels and resorts spanning various brands and segments. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as travel trends, economic conditions, and competition within the industry. By raising the price target, Wells Fargo indicates a modest upside potential of 0.60% for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) stock compared to its current market price of $248.52. This suggests that while Wells Fargo remains relatively neutral on Marriott's prospects, they still see some room for appreciation in the stock. Maintaining an Equal-Weight rating suggests that Wells Fargo believes Marriott's stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions.\n\nVulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott’s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott’s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company’s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet. Additionally, average daily rates (ADR) on corporate travel have returned to pre-Covid levels.”\n\n08. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nUpside Potential: 6%\n\nOn March 18, Piper Sandler updated its outlook on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), a leading company in the consulting and professional services industry. They raised the price target on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) from $335 to $394 while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment reflects Piper Sandler's assessment of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) performance and prospects within the competitive landscape of consulting and professional services. Accenture operates in an industry characterized by providing a wide range of services to businesses worldwide, including strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations. With the increase in price target, Piper Sandler indicates a potential upside of 6% for Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock compared to its current market price of $372.67. This suggests that while Piper Sandler sees some room for appreciation, they remain relatively neutral on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) outlook.\n\nThe Neutral rating implies that Piper Sandler believes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions. This rating takes into consideration various factors, including Accenture's financial performance, competitive position, and growth prospects in the consulting and professional services sector. Piper Sandler expects Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) second-quarter results to meet expectations, with revenue likely to be in-line amid muted market expectations. However, they anticipate the company may adjust the top end of its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of 2%-5% due to a potentially slower path to second-half acceleration. Particularly, the consensus for third-quarter growth of +7.4% quarter-over-quarter appears ambitious, according to Piper Sandler. The analysis also highlights historical trends, noting that Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has not experienced a similar level of improvement between the second and third quarters since 2017. Additionally, Piper Sandler underscores the importance of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) commentary on the macroeconomic environment, as industry peers have differing views on the timing of enterprise spend acceleration. This commentary will likely be closely monitored by investors for insights into Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) future performance and industry trends.\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n07. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nOn March 18, BofA Securities provided an updated assessment of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), a prominent player in the electrical equipment industry. Analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and revised the price target upwards from $320 to $325. This adjustment reflects BofA Securities' analysis of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) performance and outlook within the competitive landscape of the electrical equipment sector.

Eaton, whose electrical equipment enables the electrification of the power grid and electrical vehicle charging infrastructure, is benefiting from tax incentives supporting clean energy, growth in reshoring and expanding manufacturing in North America and the need for grid resiliency amid broad demand for electrification.”\n\n06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nUpside Potential: 13%\n\nOn March 18, Loop Capital provided an updated analysis of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), a leading player in the streaming entertainment industry. Analyst Alan Gould reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and adjusted the price target upward from $585 to $700. This update reflects Loop Capital's assessment of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) performance and outlook within the highly competitive streaming entertainment sector. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) operates in an industry characterized by providing digital streaming services for a wide range of entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, and original productions. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as subscriber growth, content acquisition, and competition from other streaming platforms. With the increase in the price target, Loop Capital suggests a potential upside of 13% for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock compared to its current market price of $618.39. This indicates Loop Capital's confidence in the company's growth prospects and market position.\n\nThe Buy rating signifies Loop Capital's belief that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock presents attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, Loop Capital reiterates their positive outlook on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores Loop Capital's confidence in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to innovate and capture market share in the evolving landscape of streaming entertainment.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Solar Companies in the World 16 Sites Like Alibaba: Best Alternatives to Source Products 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Microsoft Hires DeepMind Co-Founder Suleyman to Run Consumer AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has named Mustafa Suleyman head of its consumer artificial intelligence business, hiring most of the staff from his Inflection AI startup as the software giant seeks to fend off Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the fiercely contested market for AI products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips Evergrande’s Alleged $78 Billion Fraud Is Among Biggest Ever Musk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best Interests\n\nSuleyman, who co-founded Google’s DeepMind, will report to Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and oversee a range of projects, such as integrating an AI Copilot into Windows and adding conversational elements to the Bing search engine. His hiring will put Microsoft’s consumer AI work under one leader for the first time.\n\nInflection, a rival of Microsoft’s key AI partner OpenAI, is exiting its Pi consumer chatbot effort and shifting to selling AI software to businesses. Karén Simonyan, Inflection’s co-founder, will join Microsoft as chief scientist for the new consumer AI group.\n\nIn the past year, Nadella has been revamping his company’s major products around artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI. Under the Copilot brand, Microsoft has blended an AI assistant into products including Windows, consumer and enterprise Office software, Bing and security tools. With Google and others trying to catch up, Nadella’s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI has given Microsoft a first-mover advantage. And yet, 13 months after unveiling an AI-enhanced Bing search, the company has made few gains in that market, which remains dominated by Google.\n\n“We want to make sure that this next wave is one that for the consumer Microsoft can really, really create incredible products,” Suleyman said in an interview.\n\nThe new hires also mark another significant step by Microsoft to bolster its in-house AI capabilities and products, outside of the relationship with OpenAI. Last month, Microsoft invested $16 million in Mistral AI, a French rival to OpenAI. Nadella on Monday told OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about Suleyman and his team joining Microsoft, the company said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We congratulate Mustafa and Karén on their new roles and look forward to working with them,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “Our partnership with Microsoft is grounded in leveraging Azure supercomputer infrastructure built for OpenAI to power our research and train our next-generation models—a core part of our mission. We will also continue developing useful AI products like ChatGPT aimed at widely distributing the benefits of AI and driving industry-wide innovation for everyone.”\n\nNadella said Microsoft is “very committed” to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft will continue to provide the startup with the cloud-computing power to build its AI models and will use those in its software. Suleyman will be tasked with forming them into compelling, well-designed products for consumers. “We have in the world a number of cutting-edge pre-trained models,” Suleyman said. “The real challenge we have is turning those models into actual products today.”\n\nInflection in June raised $1.3 billion in one of the largest funding rounds of Silicon Valley’s AI frenzy. That round valued the startup at $4 billion, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman is a co-founder of the two-year-old startup, alongside Suleyman and Simonyan, and other investors include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Nvidia Corp.\n\nIn recent months, Inflection had talks with multiple investors about raising additional funds, according to people familiar with the conversations. The company declined to comment.\n\nGoogle, after falling behind Microsoft in the generative AI race, is starting to catch up. In February, the company rolled out Gemini, its answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The rollout hasn’t gone perfectly. Google pulled a tool designed to generate realistic-looking images of people after a flurry of criticism that its depictions of race were historically inaccurate. But earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the company was in talks to license Gemini to Apple Inc. for new iPhone features expected later this year. A deal with Apple would be Google’s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date, building on the two companies’ relationship around search and making it harder for Microsoft to make gains on smartphones.\n\nInflection’s Pi chatbot was designed to mimic human understanding of emotions and interact with users in a supportive fashion. While attracting considerable investor interest, including from Microsoft, and a million active daily users, the startup has not succeeded in finding an effective business model, Suleyman said. In the meantime, Nadella asked him to move over to Microsoft.\n\n“We want to bring real competition,” Nadella said in the interview. “The thing that’s beautiful is when the medium changes, it means we get to play again to say, what’s the browser mean? What does even the operating system mean? What is an assistant? And so that’s the exciting part—not what happened but what is going to happen—it’s the rebirth of personal computing.”\n\nMicrosoft’s consumer AI products have had their own issues. The Bing chat initially got disturbingly personal with some users, forcing the company to temporarily cut conversations short. Users in February reported Copilot was generating responses that were called bizarre, disturbing and, in some cases, harmful. Microsoft said users deliberately manipulated Copilot to generate some of those responses. This month, a company engineer sent letters to the board, lawmakers and the Federal Trade Commission warning that Microsoft wasn’t doing enough to safeguard its AI image generation tool from creating abusive and violent content.\n\nThe work Inflection has done on tone, as well as the new hires’ experience in training AI software after it has initially been developed, will be critical here, Nadella said. “One of the key insights that Pi exemplifies is that pre-training is super-important and necessary but not sufficient,” he said. “All of us in AI, at least when it comes to product-making, are realizing that the post-training step may be everything.”\n\nDeepMind was founded in 2010 and acquired four years later by Google. Suleyman was a key public face for the company, speaking to officials and at events about the promise of AI and the ethical guardrails needed around the technology.\n\nHowever, DeepMind was heavily criticized for its work in the UK health sector. Its first health product was an app called Streams that was originally designed to help doctors identify patients at risk of developing acute kidney injury. In July 2017, the UK’s data privacy watchdog said DeepMind’s partner in the project, London’s Royal Free Hospital, illegally gave the company access to 1.6 million patient records. Suleyman apologized in a statement at the time.\n\nDeepMind workers complained about his management style, the Financial Times reported. Addressing the complaints at the time, Suleyman said: “I really screwed up. I was very demanding and pretty relentless.” He added that he set “pretty unreasonable expectations” that led to “a very rough environment for some people. I remain very sorry about the impact that caused people and the hurt that people felt there.”\n\nSuleyman was placed on leave in 2019 and months later moved to Google, where he led AI product management until exiting in 2022.\n\nIn the interview Monday, Suleyman said he learned a lot from that period about the need for user trust and said Pi's design was heavily influenced by those lessons. “One of the things I earned was that trust is absolutely critical and being super transparent with users and repeatedly doing the same thing and being able to demonstrate that our products are not just reliable that users feel like they're in control.”\n\nNadella and Suleyman met years ago when Nadella gave a talk about his book Hit Refresh in London, and the two kept in touch. Conversations about joining Microsoft began in the past several months.\n\n(Updates with Inflection fundraising talks in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.",
        "content": "The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst. Pets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.\n\nBut, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?\n\nThe S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?\n\nI don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term. The Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years? As we say in the part of the world in which I live: fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the music streaming market space. Per a Grand View Research report, the global music streaming market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company added a song search capability for YouTube Music on Android devices.\r\n\r\nNotably, YouTube Music now features a dedicated button next to voice search, allowing faster access by tapping the search icon in the top-right corner.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is likely to expand its YouTube Music subscriber base on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nYouTube Music in Focus\n\nApart from the song search feature, Google introduced a \"Trim Silence\" feature in the v6.43.52 version of YouTube Music, allowing users to skip past stretches of silence in a podcast, resulting in a slightly shorter runtime.\r\n\r\nFurther, the company announced a redesign of the Now Playing feature on YouTube Music for web, introducing a full-screen experience with a Song and Video switcher, minimize button, overflow menu and cast controls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Google added several new notifications for YouTube Music on Android and iOS, alerting users about new releases and playlists.\r\n\r\nThese notifications include music recommendation notifications, playlist update notifications, podcast recommendation notifications, product update notifications and recap notifications. Users can disable these notifications in their preferences at any time.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors to enhance YouTube Music offerings will likely aid Alphabet to bolster its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth driver for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts will likely allow Alphabet to strengthen its competitive position against rivals like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN, which are also making substantial efforts to strengthen their footing in the global music streaming space.\r\n\r\nRecently, Apple offered USHER fans exclusive content on Apple Music ahead of his upcoming Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. The content includes a trailer, studio album discography, playlists curated by USHER and NFL teams, and dedicated Apple Music Radio programming for Apple Music subscribers.\r\n\r\nApple also launched a Discovery Station for Apple Music. The Discovery Station, available on Apple Music's mobile, desktop and web apps, is a curated selection of music based on users’ recent listening, which has not yet been added to the library.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is riding on the success of its music streaming service, Amazon Music.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Amazon Music Unlimited service offers an expanded catalog and over 1,000 spatial remixes for Dolby Atmos soundbars, Android and iOS devices, and Amazon Echo Studio.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of CrowdStrike have gained 28.7% in the year-to-date period.

        "title": "Google Deepens AI Push Into Health Care With Fitbit, Screenings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced a slew of initiatives to deploy its artificial intelligence models in the health care industry, including a tool that will help Fitbit users glean insights from their wearable devices and a partnership to improve screenings for cancer and disease in India.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite Neighborhood Real Estate Pain Is Showing Up in an Obscure Investment Product\n\nAt its annual health event in New York City, the company said Tuesday that teams at Google Research and Fitbit, which it owns, were developing a new AI feature that will draw data from the wristbands to coach users on their personal health. Powered by Google’s most advanced AI model, Gemini, the tool could, for example, assess how workouts affect the quality of a person’s sleep.\n\nThe tech giant also said it will work with Apollo Radiology International to deliver AI-powered screenings for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer in India. Once Apollo has secured regulatory approval, the effort will deliver 3 million free scans over the next 10 years, Google said. The company said it’s also improving health information in Google search and YouTube, its video site.\n\nGoogle has been trying to revolutionize health care for years, with varied success. It announced plans to buy Fitbit in 2019, but the deal came under heavy antitrust scrutiny amid concerns about what Google would do with the vast user data it collected. Last year, Google unveiled Med-PaLM, an AI model that has capably fielded medical questions.\n\nThe latest initiatives are part of Google’s pledge to ensure that high quality health information is being delivered across all its products used by consumers and companies, Karen DeSalvo, Google’s chief health officer, said in an interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company considers “what are the big health challenges” in the world and how its technology “can make a difference, whether it’s for the individual or for populations,” she said.\n\nRead More: Google to Weave AI Technology Into Its Health Care Offerings\n\nMountain View, California-based Google has been striving to integrate its AI work, including its large language models, into medical research. Large language models are massive systems that ingest enormous volumes of digital text — from news articles, social media posts and other sources — and use that written material to train software that predicts and generates content when given a prompt or query.\n\nOn Tuesday, Google said that it had begun to explore fine-tuning its Gemini AI model for medical applications. The personal health tool being developed in collaboration with Fitbit will also be powered by Gemini, Google said. The company didn’t disclose a timetable for when the feature will be released to the public.\n\nGreg Corrado, a senior research scientist at Google, said the surge of interest in AI has set the stage for important discussions between Google and medical professionals about how the technology can best be deployed in health care.\n\n“Its rise to prominence is the opening of a door,” Corrado said of AI. “It helps people understand that there’s a new realm of possibilities.” Google needs to “engage in a dialogue with health care providers, with doctors, with patients, with insurers to understand how the technology can be useful. It’s that conversation that I think is going to drive change over the next decade.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Elon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) shares ended the last trading session 4.6% higher at $147.68. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 0.5% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nAlphabet extended its rally, driven by a report related to its talks with Apple regarding Gemini AI. Reportedly, Apple is in negotiations with Alphabet to power AI features of iPhones with the latter’s Gemini AI models.\n\nThis internet search leader is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Revenues are expected to be $65.95 billion, up 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on GOOGL going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAlphabet belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Uber Technologies (UBER), closed the last trading session 0.5% lower at $75.70.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nIf just two years ago, you'd imagined the day the Bank of Japan ended its negative interest rate era, you'd probably not have put the yen near 34-year lows through 150 per dollar or the Nikkei stock index within 2% of record highs.\n\nYet, here they are - and Bank of Japan policy rates are positive again for the first time since 2016 after the BOJ delivered its first rate hike in 17 years at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nAnd it went big in its dismantling of its extraordinarily easy money regime - removing formal bond yield caps and purchases of stock funds.\n\nOf course the move had been telegraphed for weeks, if not months, and only the timing was at issue.\n\nAnd perhaps the market's eventual takeaway from the meeting was an emphasis on policy remaining \"accommodative\" with rates stuck around zero as a fragile economic recovery retains large rate gaps with other G7 nations.\n\nThe BOJ said it will continue its JGB purchases at broadly the same amount as before - which pushed yields lower on the day - even though it will scale back the maximum limit of its purchases.\n\nStill the prospect of further hikes were left on the table. \"If trend inflation heightens a bit more, that may lead to an increase in short-term rates,\" said BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said, without elaborating on the likely pace and timing of further moves.\n\nAnd business welcomed the move, with the chair of Japan's biggest business lobby Keidanren describing it as \"the appropriate policy decision at the appropriate time\".\n\nBut with the long-awaited hike now out of the way, dollar/yen surged to 150.62 - within 1% of 2022's peaks. And the Nikkei gained 0.6% - about 1% from its record high set earlier in the month.\n\nIn the background, Australia's dollar weakened and shares there ended higher as the Australian central bank signalled greater confidence in inflation returning to its target range after leaving policy rates unchanged at 12-year highs of 4.35%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd of course all now spins into the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which kicks off later on Tuesday.\n\nThe rates and currency market mood is hawkish going into the Fed meeting, although there was some relief on Treasury yields early Tuesday and spiky oil prices ebbed a bit.\n\nThanks largely to the yen swoon, the dollar was higher across the board, hitting its highest in almost three weeks.\n\nBut despite the cloudy U.S. interest rate picture, the buzz about artificial intelligence kept stock indexes buoyed.\n\nGoogle's parent Alphabet jumped on a media report that Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.\n\nNvidia shares added almost 1% as it kicked off its annual developer conference as investors waited for new chip announcements from Chief Executive Jensen Huang.\n\nBut Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 on Monday, gave up earlier gains to close down 6.4%, making it the biggest percentage decliner on Monday. The stock, which has rallied furiously recently on bets it would benefit from AI, is still up more than 252% for the year-to-date.\n\nAnd in a good day for mega caps, even Tesla climbed 6%, leading S&P 500 percentage gains, after the electric carmaker said it would soon increase the price of its Model Y EVs in parts of Europe.\n\nBut the tech and megacap flurry disguised a bad session for small caps, with the Russell 2000 ending down 0.7%. Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: - U.S. Feb housing starts, Jan TIC data on foreign holding of Treasuries; Canada Feb consumer price data - U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee starts two-day policy meeting, decision Wednesday - US Treasury auctions 20-year bonds, 12 month bills\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

        "title": "This Is the Cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric",
        "content": "There's been a lot of talk about the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reveals new processor as company seeks to cement AI chip market dominance (Eric Risberg, Associated Press)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia has unveiled its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip which it said it is up to 30 times speedier than its predecessor.\n\nIts new chip, named the Blackwell B200, takes two chips the size of Nvidia’s previous offering and binds them together into a single chip.\n\n“Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution,” said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at the company’s annual GTC event in San Jose attended by thousands of developers.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious as central banks circle wagons on rates\n\n“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” Huang added in a press release.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNvidia has an 80% share of the data centre AI chip market and hopes to cement its dominance with this latest chip.\n\nThe company is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple is discussing a potential deal to integrate Google’s (GOOG) artificial intelligence platform Gemini into the iPhone, Bloomberg reported.\n\nApple is holding “active negotiations” to license Gemini’s AI models to integrate its generative AI features into an upcoming software update to the iPhone later this year.\n\nApple’s models could power on-device generative AI with iOS 18, releasing later this year, while cloud-based AI features like text- and image-generation could come via partnerships with the likes of Google.\n\n\"Given Apple's installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices, a licensing deal based on volume of usage could end up being a very significant cost for Apple but a fixed license for any cloud-based usage would not be economical for partners,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said.\n\n“An on-device fixed charge per device seems most likely but would be more limited in capabilities. Apple could also use this as an approach to speed up time to market, while continuing to develop in-house technologies,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnilever (ULVR.L)\n\nUnilever has warned that up to 7,500 jobs are at risk as the Magnum maker outlined plans to split off its ice cream unit as a separate business.\n\nThis overhaul is primarily aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years. The plan will separate its ice cream businesses and divide the rest of Unilever into four divisions: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care and Nutrition.\n\nThe FTSE 100 consumer goods giant said it was accelerating its “growth action plan” which will make it a “simpler, more focused company”.\n\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Action is what shareholders wanted to see from the new team at the top, and that’s what’s been delivered today.\n\n“Ice cream always looked like the odd one out when you compare it to other product lines, and performance has struggled of late.\n\nRead more: AI could spark 'complete annihilation of humankind' unless regulated\n\n“It’s not a huge shock to see this move, but it’s something prior management wasn’t able to deliver.\n\n“Unilever’s not an overly expensive name at the minute so expect markets to react positively to the news, perhaps more due to the decisive action than anything else.”\n\nAccording to the group, any impacted staff members will be consulted about the job cuts but did not reveal whereabouts they will be made.\n\nAstrazeneca (AZN.L)\n\nAstraZeneca has acquired oncology biotech Fusion Pharmaceuticals for $2.4bn as part of a plan to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer treatments.\n\nCanadian biotech Fusion, whose shares trade in New York, is involved in radiopharmaceuticals, a rapidly growing area of cancer treatment that targets specific organs, tissues or cells within the human body.\n\n\"The acquisition marks a major step forward in AstraZeneca delivering on its ambition to transform cancer treatment and outcomes for patients by replacing traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments,\" said AstraZeneca.\n\nThe deal involves a $2bn upfront cash transaction, with a total transaction value of $2.4bn based on contingent, further payments. It follows AstraZeneca’s $1bn acquisition of a French rare diseases start-up Amolyt last week.\n\nWatch: Nvidia CEO Unveils Latest Powerful Chip at “AI Woodstock”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "These 3 Companies Have Collectively Repurchased $1.07 Trillion of Their Own Stock Since the Start of 2013",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following a challenging year in 2022, which saw all three major stock indexes plunge into respective bear markets, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite have all launched to new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nThere isn't just one factor that can be pointed to as the fuel for Wall Street's epic rally. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that includes a strong U.S. economy, better-than-expected corporate earnings, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a next-big-thing trend, and a historically robust level of share repurchase activity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough aggregate corporate share buybacks in 2023 fell from the record levels observed during the 2022 bear market, the $787.3 billion S&P 500 companies collectively spent on share repurchases on a trailing-12-month basis, as of Sept. 30, 2023, remains well above the historic average.\n\nThe reason public companies enact share repurchase programs is threefold:\n\nFor companies with steady or growing net income, a steady reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it can make a company appear more fundamentally attractive to investors. When a public company retires shares of its common stock, the ownership stakes of existing/long-term shareholders can increase over time. This encourages investors to have a long-term mindset. It's a way for a company's board of directors to demonstrate faith in a company's long-term growth strategy.\n\nWhile more than 56% of S&P 500 companies repurchased at least $5 million worth of their own stock during the September-ended quarter, there are a few companies that are step above the rest when it comes to buybacks.\n\nSince 2013, the following three widely owned companies have collectively repurchased $1.07 trillion worth of their own stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: $651 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nWhen it comes to share repurchases, it's fair to say that tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in a class of its own. Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, the company has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nTo put this into context, there are only eight companies in the S&P 500, excluding Apple, with a market cap above $651 billion. Apple could have comfortably purchased 491 of the other 499 S&P 500 companies with the amount of money it's spent buying back its stock.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons Apple has an abundance of cash to repurchase its stock. To start with, it's a trusted brand with an exceptionally loyal following. A survey conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 of more than 2,000 iPhone users found that nearly 92% had no intention of switching smartphone brands with their next purchase.\n\nInnovation is the other big reason Apple has been nothing short of a cash cow. Domestically, Apple's iPhone has accounted for 50% or more of smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable in 2020.\n\nHowever, Apple's future rests with innovation beyond the physical realm. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift toward subscription services. A subscription-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin, help smooth out some of the revenue lumpiness associated with physical product upgrade cycles, and can further enhance the benefits of the Apple product and service ecosystem.\n\nWhile reducing its outstanding share count by 41% since 2013 has provided a lift to Apple's EPS, investors should remain diligent about digging beneath the surface when analyzing the company's growth trends. For instance, even though Apple's adjusted EPS ticked higher by $0.02 per share in fiscal 2023 (ended in September), the company's net income fell by $2.8 billion to $97 billion for the year.\n\nFor the moment, Apple's buybacks are helping to partially mask a stalling of its growth engine. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet: $240 billion in share repurchases since 2015\n\nAnother S&P 500 component that's turned on the proverbial jets in the buyback department in recent years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, social media site YouTube, and autonomous driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nSince initiating a share repurchase program in 2015, Alphabet's stock buybacks have grown with each passing year. The $61.5 billion spent repurchasing its stock in 2023 increased its aggregate buybacks over roughly eight years to $240 billion. Alphabet has spent enough on buybacks that it could have purchased all but 28 companies within the S&P 500, not counting itself.\n\nIf you're wondering what's made Alphabet such a success for so long, look no further than its virtual monopoly, Google. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back almost nine years. It's the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target their message(s) to users. As a result, Google tends to enjoy premium ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nHowever, the lion's share of Alphabet's cash flow growth moving forward may well come from Google Cloud. As of the September-ended quarter, Google Cloud was the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, with an estimated 10% share of enterprise cloud spending. More importantly, this segment generated a full-year profit in 2023 after many years of losses. Cloud services tend to produce considerably higher margins than advertising.\n\nAs Alphabet's outstanding share count continues to shrink, the company's sales and net income are climbing. This is a recipe for EPS growth to outpace sales growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nMicrosoft: $183 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nThe third juggernaut that's been putting the pedal to the medal in the buyback department for more than a decade is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though I've arbitrarily cut off the start date at 2013, Microsoft has been repurchasing its stock for even longer than Apple. Since 2013, it's collectively retired around $183 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nNot including itself, Microsoft has spent more on buybacks since the beginning of 2013 than the market caps of all but 41 S&P 500 companies.\n\nMicrosoft's continued outperformance is a function of it seamlessly blending its legacy operations with a handful of high-growth initiatives. For example, it's no secret that the growth heyday for Windows and Office have long since passed. Nevertheless, Windows still holds a 72% share of desktop operating systems worldwide. This is an exceptionally high-margin segment that generates abundant cash flow, which allows Microsoft to aggressively invest in higher-growth initiatives.\n\nWith regard to \"high-growth initiatives,\" I'm primarily talking about cloud services and AI. Cloud infrastructure service platform Azure is the world's No. 2 provider in terms of enterprise spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and recently unveiled its Maia AI chip to help power its own Azure data centers. The cloud and AI can help Microsoft sustain a double-digit sales growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft also has what might be the most pristine balance sheet on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to receive the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Microsoft closed out calendar year 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's generated nearly $103 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash allows Microsoft to innovate, make acquisitions, buy back copious amounts of its own stock, and comfortably pay out the largest nominal-dollar dividend among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The effort to ban TikTok faces potential 'graveyard' in Senate",
        "content": "The Senate often becomes a key stumbling block in Washington's efforts to confront Big Tech. The question now is whether that will change as the upper chamber weighs the fate of TikTok in the US.\n\nA possible ban of the popular social-media app is atop the Senate’s agenda as lawmakers return to the nation's capital this week. This comes after a 352-65 House vote to advance legislation that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the app or face that ban in the US.\n\nThe Senate in past years has served as a flashing red light to other technology reforms that found bipartisan enthusiasm in the House, including data privacy efforts and a move to prohibit tech giants from favoring their own products.\n\n\"The Senate may very well be a graveyard of this,\" said Mark MacCarthy of the Brookings Institution and Georgetown University, in an interview about whether the TikTok legislation could fit a similar pattern.\n\nThere's \"some buyer's remorse that is beginning to develop over the rapidity with which the action was taken.\" People work inside a TikTok building in Culver City, Calif. earlier this month. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe signals so far from the Senate are that it will move slowly, if at all. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has yet to tip his hand, saying only that the Senate will take a look at the legislation once it formally arrives.\n\nWhile bipartisan energy behind any effort to take on China could overwhelm efforts to slow the bill, there are also significant legal issues that senators may not be keen to overlook.\n\nFor one, the bill's decision to name TikTok specifically would almost certainly be challenged in court. There is also a broader concern that it would be challenged for taking away the First Amendment rights of American users.\n\n\"I don't see how they can change that,\" MacCarthy says of the free speech concerns. \"That's the heart of the bill.\"\n\nWashington's supposed 'cooling saucer'\n\nTech, of course, is far from the only issue where the Senate has taken on the role of tempering enthusiasm elsewhere in Washington.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt goes back to the beginning. George Washington reputedly said the Senate was created to \"cool\" House legislation like a saucer can be used to cool hot tea. To cite a more recent example, a bipartisan tax bill passed the House overwhelmingly in January of this year and is also currently languishing in the Senate.\n\nBut tech is where that pattern was particularly noticeable in recent years. Some activists charged that lawmakers in the upper chamber, and Schumer in particular, were too accommodating to the objections of CEOs.\n\nOne example came in 2022 when a bill that aimed to stop companies from favoring their own products over competitors seemed to be on the cusp of passage. After a furious lobbying effort from Big Tech CEOs, the bill never received a Senate vote as leaders like Schumer raised questions about whether it had the votes to pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, seen here in 2023, is known for communicating on a flip phone. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nAnother episode took place in 2023 when the tech topic of the day was privacy, and the Biden administration and House lawmakers were pushing for action around a bipartisan bill called the American Data Privacy Protection Act. That bill still hasn't been considered after concerns were raised in the Senate and elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to Schumer, the fate of the TikTok bill could also be in the hands of Sen. Maria Cantwell, an influential Washington state Democrat who chairs the Senate's commerce committee.\n\nShe has been only slightly more forthcoming than Schumer so far. She praised the idea of taking on the issue but didn't sound like a fan of the House approach in a statement that said in part \"I will be talking to my Senate and House colleagues to try to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties.\"\n\nAnd TikTok itself clearly views the Senate as the key battleground, with CEO Shou Zi Chew focusing his lobbying efforts on senators. In a recent video, he urged his 170 million American users to pass along their concerns to friends and family and also \"share them with your senators.\"\n\nHe also said in the video that his company was exploring its legal options.\n\nA scrambled politics around TikTok\n\nFurther complicating the path ahead are different alliances this time around when compared to previous tech fights.\n\nSome advocates who are still pushing last year's privacy efforts — and who have been deeply critical of the Senate's role there — are opposed to taking action on TikTok.\n\nIn just one recent example, the left-leaning group More Perfect Union renewed its calls to pass a privacy bill while also arguing against a TikTok ban. It said in a video on the issue that \"the only real chance TikTok has is the Senate.\" Participants hold signs in support of TikTok outside the U.S. Capitol Building on March 13. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nAnd there is also a recent flip on the issue from former President Donald Trump.\n\nAfter years of pushing to ban TikTok, the presumptive GOP nominee for President argued against the bill in multiple recent Truth Social posts because he said getting rid of TikTok would help Mark Zuckerberg. Trump called Facebook (META) \"a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nHouse Republicans largely ignored Trump’s stance and voted for the bill by a margin of 197-15, but the former president's point about side effects of a TikTok ban is one others are raising as well.\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance Live appearance, Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill noted of TikTok \"if it was shut down, the place you're going to go is probably on YouTube and the advertisers would flip over so Google (GOOG) could be a beneficiary.\" Facebook and Pinterest (PINS) also could be helped, he added.\n\nThe House bill has also won the backing of two key senators in recent days with Senate intelligence committee chair Mark Warner and the top Republican Marco Rubio expressing their support and observers like Professor MacCarthy saying the bill still has a significant chance of passage.\n\nAt the end of the day, Washington and tech sector are waiting to see where Senate leaders end up. Schumer is currently focused on feeling out where his Democratic colleagues stand, according to MacCarthy.\n\n\"And I think it's the right job for a majority leader to be doing,\" he said.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "There is an answer for investors who fear they missed out on the big rally in technology stocks. After strong 2023 returns, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index so far this year.\n\nShares of Google's parent company are up about 1% in 2024 while the index has returned nearly 7%. But with businesses including the leading online search engine, a growing YouTube social media platform, and one of the top three cloud computing platforms, Alphabet stock could be ready to take off again.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing\n\nAlphabet still gets most of its revenue from advertising, and an online advertising slowdown has soured investors on the company's stock. Google advertising revenue declined by more than 10% in fourth quarter of 2023 year over year.\n\nBut Alphabet's cloud segment is growing and has increased its revenue share for the past several years. Google Cloud contributed nearly 11% of Alphabet's sales in 2023, compared to just 4.3% in 2018. Data Source: Statista\n\nInvestors seem to think it is falling behind in the race to monetize artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, though. The company famously muddled the introduction of its Gemini AI model. But even if Alphabet is losing the sprint for a successful generative AI offering, it could be a winner in the AI marathon.\n\nThat's because cloud users are integrating AI tools to modernize their businesses. The integration of AI will require more and more computing power. That's evident in the exploding revenue Nvidia has been reporting from sales of its H100 graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nWhat's important for Alphabet, and specifically Google Cloud, is that AI is intensifying the adoption of cloud computing. Tim Potter, a principal at Deloitte Consulting, noted that \"Most AI solutions are either services offered directly by cloud hyperscalers or solutions built on top of a hyperscaler's cloud infrastructure.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's good news for leading cloud providers like Alphabet and should help to meaningfully drive its business going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge in Utah took the extremely unusual step of sanctioning the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying that the regulator abused its authority in a case against crypto platform Digital Licensing Inc., known as DEBT Box.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Musk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best Interests Trump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Nvidia Unveils Successor to Its All-Conquering AI Processor Putin Warns Russia Won’t Stop After Predictable Election Win\n\nThe SEC’s conduct “constitutes a gross abuse of the power entrusted to it by Congress and substantially undermined the integrity of these proceedings and the judicial process,” Robert Shelby, a federal district court judge in Salt Lake City, said in an 80-page legal filing on Monday. He also ordered the agency to pay DEBT Box’s attorney’s fees and other costs related to the restraining order that the regulator had sought against the crypto platform.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said the regulator is reviewing the decision. Richard Hong, an attorney for DEBT Box, declined to comment.\n\nThe SEC sued DEBT Box in July 2023, accusing the crypto platform of defrauding investors of at least $49 million. The same month, Shelby froze the company’s assets and put the company into receivership at the SEC’s request.\n\nHowever, the freeze was later reversed after the court found that the SEC may have made “materially false and misleading representations” in the process.\n\nIn one example cited by Shelby, when the SEC asked for its freeze against DEBT Box, Michael Welsh, an SEC attorney, said that DEBT Box was moving investor funds abroad. After DEBT Box disputed that statement, Welsh told the court that he did not have direct evidence of investor funds being moved overseas, and that he was making an “inference” based in part on a YouTube video by a DEBT Box official.\n\nAccording to Shelby, the regulator’s misconduct wasn’t limited to a single misstatement or imprecise comment. Each piece of evidence the SEC used to seek and later defend the emergency restrictions against DEBT Box “proved to be some combination of false, mischaracterized, and misleading,” he said in the Monday order.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe SEC’s enforcement chief, Gurbir Grewal, apologized to Shelby for mistakes make in the DEBT Box case in December. Welsh also apologized for his conduct. Grewal said he would mandate new training for SEC enforcement staff on the standards needed when seeking emergency relief.\n\nLast month, several Republican senators sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, saying cases such as the one involving DEBT Box undermine the public’s trust in the regulator’s enforcement actions.\n\nSome in the crypto industry, which has been locked in a bitter fight with the SEC, took to social media to spotlight the judge’s rebuke on Monday.\n\nHowever, Shelby emphasized that the Monday order shouldn’t be read as providing an opinion on the underlying merits of the SEC’s case, which the court hasn’t yet been able to evaluate. “This Order focuses exclusively on the Commission’s conduct.” The judge also denied the agency’s motion to dismiss the case.\n\n“Regulatory agencies require supervision by people who understand the gravity of the matters they are supervising,” said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who now works as a consultant. “It sounds like the supervisors were asleep at the switch here.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang showed off new chips aimed at extending his company’s dominance of artificial intelligence computing, a position that’s already made it the world’s third-most-valuable business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Musk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best Interests Putin Warns Russia Won’t Stop After Predictable Election Win Nvidia Backs Little-Known Upstart in India’s Biggest AI Bet Yet Top Solar Firm Longi Plans Thousands of Job Cuts on Glut\n\nA new processor design called Blackwell is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI, the company said at its GTC conference in San Jose, California. That includes the process of developing the technology — a stage known as training – and the running of it, which is called inference.\n\nThe Blackwell chips, which are made up of 208 billion transistors, will be the basis of new computers and other products being deployed by the world’s largest data center operators — a roster that includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle Corp.\n\nBlackwell — named after David Blackwell, the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Science — has a tough act to follow. Its predecessor, Hopper, fueled explosive sales at Nvidia by building up the field of AI accelerator chips. The flagship product from that lineup, the H100, has become one of the most prized commodities in the tech world — fetching tens of thousands of dollars per chip.\n\nThe growth has sent Nvidia’s valuation soaring as well. It is the first chipmaker to have a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion and trails only Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. overall.\n\nHuang, Nvidia’s co-founder, said AI is the driving force in a fundamental change in the economy and that Blackwell chips are “the engine to power this new industrial revolution,” according to prepared remarks for Monday’s event. Nvidia is “working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new design has so many transistors — the tiny switches that give semiconductors their ability to store and process information — that it’s too big for conventional production techniques. It’s actually two chips married to each other through a connection that ensures they act seamlessly as one, the company said. Nvidia’s manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will use its 4NP technique to produce the product.\n\nBlackwell will also have an improved ability to link with other chips and a new way of crunching AI-related data that speeds up the process. It’s part of the next version of the company’s “superchip” lineup, meaning it’s combined with Nvidia’s central processing unit called Grace. Users will have the choice to pair those products with new networking chips — one that uses a proprietary InfiniBand standard and another that relies on the more common Ethernet protocol. Nvidia is also updating its HGX server machines with the new chip.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company got its start selling graphics cards that became popular among computer gamers. Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, ultimately proved successful in other areas because of their ability to divide up calculations into many simpler tasks and handle them in parallel. That technology is now graduating to more complex, multistage tasks, based on ever-growing sets of data.\n\nBlackwell will help drive the transition beyond relatively simple AI jobs, such as recognizing speech or creating images, the company said. That might mean generating a three-dimensional video by simply speaking to a computer, relying on models that are have as many as 1 trillion parameters.\n\nFor all its success, Nvidia’s revenue has become highly dependent on a handful of cloud computing giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Those companies are pouring cash into data centers, aiming to outdo their rivals with new AI-related services.\n\nThe challenge for Nvidia is broadening its technology to more customers. Huang aims to accomplish this by making it easier for corporations and governments to implement AI systems with their own software, hardware and services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "On Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took the wraps off of the company’s highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nThe Blackwell is the successor to Nvidia’s already highly coveted H100 and H200 GPUs, and according to the company, it is the world’s most powerful chip. The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia’s data center revenue over the last few quarters.\n\nIn its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment’s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.\n\n“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,” Huang said in a statement.\n\n“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.”\n\nLike its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia’s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.\n\nThat setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.\n\nNvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia’s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don’t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia’s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia’s chips are especially power-hungry.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers’ concerns.\n\nNvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia’s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they’ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.\n\nBut competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren’t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his program on March 12 recalled his obsession with the stock market as a kid and how he became interested in companies and investing when he was just a fourth grader. Cramer advised his viewers to introduce their kids to investing as early as possible. Cramer said you should pick some companies that your kids are familiar with and ask them to guess which one of them would perform the best over time.\n\n“Get them started early…. The stock is a long-term contest. The earlier you get in, the more you can potentially win, over the long haul.”\n\n\"Stocks Still Represent the Greatest Opportunity\"\n\nAnswering a question in the same program, Jim Cramer advised investors not to put “too much money” in bonds because Cramer believes “stocks still represent the greatest opportunity.”\n\nIn a separate program on March 15, in which Cramer talked about his career in the Wall Street and how he witnessed some of the biggest market crashes in history, the CNBC host said when you are in your 20s you should invest in growth. Cramer said younger people should take more risk early in life because they have many years ahead of them. Cramer said he “really wants risk taking” when you are younger.\n\nCramer also advised investors not to put all their money in a stock at once. Instead, Cramer recommended that you should invest some in the start and then buy more when the stock is going down.\n\nTalking about some of the worst market crashes in US history, Cramer said:\n\n“Tough days don't last forever people but when they come along you need to know how to respond.” Jim Cramer’s Predictions Were Right About These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nWe cover Jim Cramer's stock picks and recommendations every week. But how have Cramer's stock picks been performing? Everyone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and they are going strong. But what about several others stocks Cramer recommended buying and selling over the past few months? In this article we decided to take a look at the stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy and sell in 2023 or early 2024 and saw how these companies have performed so far in 2024 based on their year-to-date stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\n9. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nIn August last year, Jim Cramer said investing in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was like “sending your money up in smoke.”\n\nIn July, Cramer said the following about Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB):\n\n“No, let’s move on from Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), let’s move on from them. They’re losing money... it’s not my cup of tea.”\n\nRocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares are down by about 22% this year through March 18.\n\nLast month the company talked about guidance and key business updates during its Q4 earnings call:\n\n\"Overall, we expect gross margin trends will continue to improve over time, thanks to the same factors that help drive improvement this year. In terms of when we can get to adjusted EBITDA breakeven Neutron investment, especially R&D spend, continues to be the pacing item to achieve its critical milestone. Turning to our recent fundraising of $355 million in convertible senior notes. With this financing, we believe we secured a large quantum of cost-effective and shareholder-friendly capital. The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program.\n\nWith that, let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the first quarter to range between $92 million and $98 million, representing sequential revenue growth of between 53% and 63%. This range reflects $60 million to $65 million of contribution from space systems and $32 million to $33 million from launch services, which assumes four launches. Although modestly lower than what we previously expected for Q4 just a few months ago. We don’t want to understate how encouraged we are with the magnitude of this forecasted quarter-on-quarter growth and how positively it reflects on the capabilities of the team to deliver this level of growth in such a complex and competitive set of businesses. We expect first quarter GAAP gross margin to range between 24% to 26% and non-GAAP gross margins to range between 29% to 31%.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nArlington, Virginia-based defense contractor AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) ranks 8th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about.  In December 2023, Jim Cramer had praised AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) quarterly results and said that AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) CEO Wahid Nawabi was doing a “terrific job.”\n\n“So I would be a buyer of the stock,” Cramer said at the time.\n\nNawabi earlier this month talked about key company updates and guidance during latest earnings call:\n\n\"With a strong third-quarter performance behind us, we’re increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We now anticipate revenue of $700 million to $710 million. Full-year net income of $51 million to $55 million or $1.86 to $2 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $122 million to $127 million. Non-GAAP earnings of $2.69 to $2.83 per diluted share. And R&D spend totaling 13% to 14% of revenue. We remain confident in our growth trajectory for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our backlog remains strong, our visibility is nearly 100%, and our pipeline continues to expand. While we await approvals on the continuing resolution in supplemental assistance package in Congress, we remain hopeful that a bipartisan agreement will be reached soon.\n\nWe stand ready with our cutting-edge battle-tested solutions and unmatched manufacturing capacity to meet our customers needs. Given our strong performance, we remain on a trajectory of our best year ever again. As stated in the past, our expectations for this year and beyond are not driven by a single product or customer, but by the overall expanding global demand and our autonomous AI-enabled unmanned solutions. We are ideally suited to continue this growth trajectory given our global installed base, battle-tested solution offering, successful track record, proven best-in-class technology, agile product development cycle, and unmatched manufacturing capacity. As our addressable markets expand, we remain well-positioned to benefit from budget priorities in the U.S. and abroad as an industry leader and the original defense technology innovator.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nAeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) stock has gained about 20% in 2024 through March 18. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nEarlier this month AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) posted Q3 results, reporting an EPS of $0.63 for the quarter, beating estimates by $0.29.\n\n7. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending investors to dump Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) for quite some time now. In December Cramer said he had decided to “pull the plug” on the stock. In August last year Cramer advised investors to sell the stock because he believed Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) was disappointing. Cramer was right, based on the stock’s performance so far this year. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 27% in 2024 through March 18.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). Jim Cramer recommends selling PLUG but he is bullish on companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n6. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about Canadian-based telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU):\n\n“I think they’re a loser, honestly. I mean, honestly. They’re just doing a terrible job. We do not need that, there’s like 40 other guys in that same space that are better.”\n\nTelus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have dipped by about 7% this year and about 17% over the past one year.\n\n5. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLithium metal batteries company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. Back in July 2023, Jim Cramer had told his viewers that there was “nothing there” for this stock and took a “hard pass” on it when asked about his take on Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Over the past one year Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) shares have lost about 25% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $23.2 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). While Cramer is bearish on QS, he recommends buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "*\n\nNvidia AI developer conference kicks off with new chips in focus\n\n*\n\nAlphabet jumps on report of talks to build Gemini AI into iPhone\n\n*\n\nNasdaq says issues impacting connectivity resolved\n\n*\n\nIndexes up: Dow 0.20%, S&P 0.63%, Nasdaq 0.82%\n\n(Updates with final closing prices, volume data)\n\nBy Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\nMarch 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Monday, with megacap growth stocks such as Alphabet and Tesla supporting a rebound in technology-heavy Nasdaq while investors also waited anxiously for the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting this week.\n\nGoogle's parent Alphabet provided a sizeable boost to the market after a media report that Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.\n\nThis supported the communication services sector, which ended up almost 3%, leading gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors after hitting its highest level since Sept. 2021.\n\nTesla shares finished up 6.3%, leading S&P 500 percentage gains, after the electric carmaker said it would soon increase the price of its Model Y EVs in parts of Europe.\n\nNvidia shares added 0.7% but closed well below its session high. The artificial intelligence poster-child kicked off its annual developer conference as investors waited for new chip announcements from Chief Executive Jensen Huang.\n\nInvestors were torn between enthusiasm about the prospects for AI on the technology sector and worries ahead to the Federal Reserve's policy update on Wednesday, according to Lindsey Bell, chief strategist at 248 Ventures in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"This is a market that really wants to hold onto the momentum trade but what's really weighing on investors' minds is what happens with the Fed this week,\" said Bell.\n\n\"The market is sitting comfortably with the first cut coming in June or July but not entirely confident it'll be the case. The question is if it gets pushed out further.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 75.66 points, or 0.20% , to 38,790.43, the S&P 500 gained 32.33 points, or 0.63%, to 5,149.42 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 130.27 points, or 0.82%, to 16,103.45.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq snapped three straight days of losses.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index gave up gains to end the day virtually unchanged while the S&P 500 technology index finished up 0.5%.\n\nOf the S&P's 11 major sectors the weakest were rate sensitive real estate and healthcare, with both off 0.02%.\n\nStronger-than-expected inflation figures have prompted traders to rethink when and by how much policymakers will lower rates this year, with traders pulling back the probability for a June rate cut to around 51% from about 71% just a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nIf the Fed were to take a hawkish tone when its policy meeting concludes on Wednesday, this could pressure stocks.\n\n\"The fact we're up today provides investors with an opportunity to take profits ahead of the Fed which is more likely to disappoint than to support the recent rally in risk assets,\" said Sameer Samana, Senior Global Market Strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Charlotte.\n\nGoldman Sachs on Monday said they now expect three interest rate cuts in 2024, compared with four expected earlier, after inflation came in a bit firmer than expected.\n\n\"With the market near recent highs it's very difficult to see what could provide an upside spark from here. It's not hard to imagine the things that could cause disappointment,\" said Samana citing the Fed and high valuations for tech stocks.\n\nExchange operator Nasdaq said it resolved an issue related to connectivity and stock orders that had affected early trading for more than two hours on Monday.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Xpeng added 1.9% on its plans to launch a cheaper EV brand amid fierce price competition.\n\nBoeing finished down 1.5% after a media report that a federal grand jury in Seattle issued a subpoena to the planemaker over the Jan. 5 midair blowout of a Boeing door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 on Monday, gave up earlier gains to close down 6.4%, making it the biggest percentage decliner on the day in the benchmark index.\n\nHowever, the stock, which has rallied furiously recently on bets it would benefit from AI, is still up more than 252% for the year-to-date.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 224 new highs and 58 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq 1,905 stocks rose and 2,400 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 1.26-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq recorded 102 new highs and 131 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 11.16 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.41 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

        "content": "Apple is in talks with Google to use its new Gemini artificial intelligence models to power the AI features for iPhones after previously discussing the prospect with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a new report.\n\nCiting people familiar, Bloomberg reported Monday that Apple is in \"active negotiations\" with Alphabet-owned Google's Gemini to run new features coming to iPhone software, but any potential deal would likely not be announced until Apple's Worldwide Development Conference (WWDC) in June. Apple is reportedly in talks with Google to use its Gemini artificial intelligence models to power upcoming features in iPhones.\n\nNeither Apple nor Google immediately responded to FOX Business' requests for comment on the report.\n\nMICROSOFT TELLS EUROPEAN REGULATORS GOOGLE HAS AN EDGE IN GENERATIVE AI\n\nA possible deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nIt could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIS GOOGLE TOO BROKEN TO BE FIXED?

        "content": "Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco - Aaron M. Sprecher/Bloomberg\n\nDitching oil and gas is a “fantasy” amid increasing demand, one of the world’s most powerful oil and gas bosses has said.\n\nAmin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said the transition to net zero is “visibly failing” with oil demand set to rise for “some time to come”.\n\n“The current discourse on energy transition ignores this reality,” he told the CERAWeek conference in Texas.\n\n“The world should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas.”\n\nRising demand from developing economies could feed oil demand growth through 2045, he said.\n\nThis forecast for long-term demand growth is in line with forecasts from Opec and in contrast to the 2030 forecast for peak demand from the West’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two are far apart on both short-term and long-term demand forecasts, in part because of their contrasting views on the energy transition.\n\nReducing greenhouse gas emissions from hydrocarbons through carbon capture and other technologies achieves better results than alternative energies, Nasser said.\n\nNew energy sources and technologies should only be introduced when they are genuinely ready, and economically competitive, he added.\n\nWithout government subsidies, electric vehicles are as much as 50pc more expensive than internal-combustion cars, he added. “They cannot be subsidised forever.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:59 PM GMT\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today. Chris Price will be back in the morning, but I’ll leave you with some of the latest pieces from elsewhere at The Telegraph:\n\nHeathrow has lost its status as a global transport hub, says Dubai Airports boss Cut borrowing or face debt crisis, warns top central banker Don’t use ‘threatening’ tone when chasing debts to protect borrowers’ mental health, companies told\n\n06:14 PM GMT\n\nDirty Martini owner reveals higher losses\n\nCocktail bar operator Nightcap has revealed higher losses and cautioned over “challenging” trading since the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts boss, the former Dragons’ Den panellist Sarah Willingham, said conditions will remain challenging for the next few months.

It previously said it would do so “in a disciplined manner” to maximise value for its own shareholders.\n\nHaleon owns brands including Centrum vitamins, Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol pain relief. It recently sold off its Lamisil antifungal cream and Chapstick brands as it focuses on reducing its debt pile. By the end of 2023, it had reduced its debt by more than £2bn since its spin-off from GSK.\n\nGSK has already started selling down its position in Haleon. Last May, it sold 240m shares, taking its stake from 13pc down to 10.3pc . In October, it offloaded another 270m worth of shares and cut its position to 4.2pc in January this year.\n\nPfizer’s decision to start paring its stake back comes as it looks to focus more on its medicines and vaccines.\n\nThe US drugmaker is currently battling to bolster its pipeline of treatments after the end of a boost from the Covid pandemic, when it sold billions of dollars worth of its jabs.

Spending on factories and equipment, known as fixed-asset investments, rose 4.2pc.\n\nLondon’s benchmark stock index was also boosted by Reckitt Benckiser, which jumped as much as 5.9pc after slumping around 14pc on Friday after the consumer goods giant lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.\n\nHaleon was among the worst performers, down as much as 3.2pc after its top shareholder Pfizer said it would reduce its stake in the toothpaste maker from 32pc to about 24pc, selling shares worth about £2bn.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 edged 0.2pc lower after an 11pc fall in Marshalls as the landscaping and roofing products supplier flagged lower revenue for 2024 on slower-than-expected recovery.\n\nInvestors will watch UK inflation figures due on Wednesday, as well as interest rate decisions by the Bank of Japan, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.\n\nThe Bank is widely expected to keep rates at current levels in the upcoming meeting, although the focus will be on ascertaining the timing of the first rate cut.\n\n08:22 AM GMT\n\nBuilders’ merchant Marshalls warns of ‘slower’ recovery\n\nBuilding materials supplier Marshalls has warned it expects the industry to remain “subdued” over the first half of 2024 and see a “slower” recovery than previously expected.\n\nIt came as the London-listed company revealed a slump in profits and revenues for last year, and downgraded forecasts for 2024.\n\nMarshalls said it closed and mothballed factories and reduced shifts in other facilities in 2023 in an attempt to cut costs, leading to the loss of 330 jobs during the year.

Meta still uses a nearby building on Brock Street.\n\nBritish Land has marketed the site as a science and innovation building “in the heart of the Regent’s Place campus within London’s Knowledge Quarter”, which is home to leading research institutions including The Francis Crick Institute, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute and University College London.\n\nChief executive Simon Carter said:\n\nWe proactively took 1 Triton Square back from Meta to reposition it for science and innovation customers, with the expectation of unlocking significantly higher rents, whilst benefitting from a considerable surrender premium to further improve the economics.\n\nThis transaction is another example of how we drive value through establishing innovative JV partnerships, enabling us to flex our balance sheet, share the risk and crystallise the value created from Meta’s surrender premium.\n\nMark Evans of Royal London Asset Management Property added: “We have long recognised the demand for best-in-class science and innovation space, particularly in the Golden Triangle, and the need for this space in supporting the UK’s economic growth.

That equates to a £5,279 increase, which markets the biggest rise in 10 months.\n\nIn a further sign of recovery for the UK housing market, the number of sales being agreed has risen 13pc compared with this time last year.\n\nTim Bannister, director of property science at Rightmove, said: “The stronger than usual price growth this March indicates that new sellers are feeling much more confident, with some perhaps being over-optimistic, that there is enough buyer activity and affordability in their local market to achieve a higher price.”\n\nLondon saw the biggest increase in demand for properties compared with this time last year, as slowing inflation, wage increases and a push back to offices among employers made the capital more appealing.\n\nMuch of the activity in the housing market has been driven by sales of properties to wealthy buyers for whom mortgage rates are less of an issue. So-called ‘top-of-the-ladder’ sales were up 18pc in March so far compared with last year, Rightmove said.\n\nDespite March’s jump, average asking prices are still £4,776 lower than their peak in May 2023.\n\nMr Bannister added:\n\nDespite the above-average price increases in this opening three months of the year, asking prices are still £4,776 below their peak in May 2023.\n\nFor those who can afford to buy and have yet to take action to move this year, this may provide a window of opportunity to buy as we now seem to be past the bottom of the market.\n\nWhile some sellers are still being overoptimistic with their pricing expectations, there are also more sellers who are aware of the need to be negotiable and realistic, with elevated interest rates compared to recent years still stretching affordability for many buyers. Rightmove has released its latest figures on UK house asking prices - Yui Mok/PA Wire\n\n06:47 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining us today. An improving mortgage market has given house sellers the confidence to demand an extra £5,000 for their home on average this month compared to February.\n\nRightmove said the value of newly marketed house has risen by 1.5pc to £368,118.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Migration surge drives London population to new record | Concerns over housing intensify as capital surpasses pre-pandemic peak\n\n2) Hunt hits landlords with stealth capital gains tax raid | Previous reduction in tax-free allowance offsets gains from lowered rate\n\n3) ITV cuts jobs amid advertising slump | Broadcaster faces biggest slump in advertising since financial crisis\n\n4) British Airways to use robot baggage handlers at Gatwick | Driverless baggage tugs to be rolled out as industry battles staff shortages\n\n5) Why Britain’s four-day week pioneer says he will never go back | Boss of UK challenger bank Atom believes office purists need to ‘grow up’\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian stocks advanced ahead of policy decisions this week by the Bank of England, Japan’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve.\n\nChinese data for January-February were mixed, with property investment falling while other indicators showed improvement.\n\nIn Tokyo, shares closed sharply higher as investors await a decision by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday on whether to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in 17 years.

        "content": "*\n\nNvidia AI developer conference kicks off with new chips in focus\n\n*\n\nAlphabet jumps on report of talks to build Gemini AI into iPhone\n\n*\n\nNasdaq says issues impacting connectivity resolved\n\n*\n\nIndexes up: Dow 0.43%, S&P 0.90%, Nasdaq 1.24%\n\n(Updates prices at 02:27 p.m ET/ 1827 GMT)\n\nBy Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\nMarch 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Monday, with a rally in megacap growth stocks such as Alphabet and Tesla supporting a rebound in technology-heavy Nasdaq while investors also waited for the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting this week.\n\nGrowth stocks were outperforming, with Alphabet gaining 4.8% after a media report that Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.\n\nThis boosted the communication services sector, which lead gains among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors and was up 2.9% after earlier hitting its highest level since Sept. 2021.\n\nTesla rose 6.4% after the electric carmaker said it would increase the price of its Model Y EVs in some European countries on March 22, by approximately 2,000 euros ($2,177) or its equivalent in local currencies.\n\nTrading was choppy in artificial intelligence poster-child Nvidia, which kicks off its annual developer conference, with investors waiting for new chip announcements from Chief Executive Jensen Huang after the close. The stock was last up 1% after rising as much as 5% earlier in the day.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index also pared gains and was last up 0.6%. The S&P 500 technology index was up 1%.\n\n\"Tech, semis all of it is a little over cooked. Once something is priced to perfection the next step is usually consolidation or some type of disappointment,\" said Sameer Samana, Senior Global Market Strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Charlotte, NC.\n\nAt 02:27 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.61 points, or 0.43% , to 38,879.38, the S&P 500 gained 45.90 points, or 0.90%, to 5,162.99 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 197.72 points, or 1.24%, to 16,170.89.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors were also preparing for the Fed meeting in hopes of clues about the first rate cuts. Stronger-than-expected inflation figures have prompted traders to rethink when and by how much policymakers will lower rates this year, with traders pulling back bets for a June rate cut from just a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nGoldman Sachs on Monday said they now expect three interest rate cuts in 2024, compared with four expected earlier, after inflation came in a bit firmer than expected.\n\nIf the Fed were to take a hawkish tone when its policy meeting concludes on Wednesday, this could pressure stocks.\n\n\"The fact we're up today provides investors with an opportunity to take profits ahead of the Fed which is more likely to disappoint than to support the recent rally in risk assets. They've tied themselves to the data and the data suggests less need to ease policy,\" said Samana.\n\nExchange operator Nasdaq said it resolved an issue related to connectivity and stock orders that had affected early trading for more than two hours on Monday.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Xpeng climbed 2.4% on the company's plans to launch a cheaper EV brand amid fierce price competition.\n\nBoeing shed 1.3% after a media report that a federal grand jury in Seattle issued a subpoena to the planemaker over the Jan. 5 midair blowout of a Boeing door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 on Monday, gave up earlier gains and fell 6.6%. However, the stock, which has been boosted by bets it would benefit from AI, is still up around 245% for the year-to-date.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.49-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, which showed 197 new highs and 47 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq 2,249 stocks rose and 1,947 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about a 1.16-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 91 new highs and 109 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai, Maju Samuel and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "The Nasdaq Stock Market has been hitting new highs this year.\n\nNasdaq is a market with a dual personality. It's home to most large technology companies, and also the place where a slew of smaller stocks in other industries are traded.\n\nTech stocks have been the stock market's leaders last year and so far this year. Smaller stocks are starting to come alive.\n\nMost investors head to the Nasdaq for technology exposure. That's fine, but I wouldn't ignore the small fry in other industries. Here are seven Nasdaq stocks I like now.\n\nEast West\n\nEast West Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC), based in Pasadena, California, finances a lot of film and television projects. It's also one of the few U.S. banks licensed to do business in China.\n\nU.S.-China relations stink right now. And the major presidential candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump) aren't perceived as friendly to China. But neither was Richard Nixon, until he moved to open up a relationship with China in 1972.\n\nAny thaw in the U.S.-China relationship would be good for East West. Meanwhile, it is doing pretty well, having increased its earnings by more than 14% a year over the past 10 years.\n\nAgco\n\nSelling all kinds of agricultural equipment, from fertilizer to tractors, through a network of more than 3,000 dealers worldwide, Agco Corp. (NYSE:AGCO) has been profitable in each of the past 24 years.\n\nOver the past 10 years, it has increased its earnings at better than a 14% clip (coincidentally the same as East West). Its return on stockholders' equity lately has been running at 27%; I consider anything over 15% good. Yet the stock is cheap, selling for less than 8 times recent earnings.\n\nLegacy Housing\n\nBased in Bedford, Texas, Legacy Housing Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGH) makes manufactured homes and extra-small homes, serving the low end of the housing market.\n\nSince the U.S. has a shortage of single-family homes, and since paying for a home is a strain from many families, I think this company occupies a useful niche. The company has very little debt, and the stock sells for 9 times earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nPreformed Line\n\nPreformed Line Products Co. (NASDAQ:PLPC), which calls Cleveland, Ohio home, makes equipment for power lines and phone lines. It also makes mounting systems for solar panels.\n\nOver the past decade, Preformed has increased its earnings at a 19% annual pace. Last year growth was slower, at 7%. The stock sells for about 10 times earnings.\n\nMasterCraft Boat\n\nI've had poor luck with holdings in the boating industry. Nonetheless, I think that MasterCraft Boat Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MCFT) looks intriguing.\n\nThe company, out of Vonore, Tennessee, makes sport boats and outboard boats. The pandemic boosted boat sales because it's a form of recreation that is outdoors and doesn't involve crowds. Lately boat makers' sales have retreated, but if they level off, I like this stock at less than 7 times earnings.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWe don't want to neglect the big tech companies. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that have chalked up big gains in Alphabet's case, 373% over the past 10 years.\n\nAlphabet is the parent to Google, You Tube, Waymo and Deep Mind. Innovation is built into its culture, and the company has increased its earnings by an average of more than 21% a year over the past decade.\n\nThe stock is much more expensive than those discussed above, but I don't think that 24 times earnings is too much to pay here.\n\nApple\n\nEven more expensive, at 27 times earnings, is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of iPhones and Mac computers. Here there are worries, but also great strengths.\n\nEarnings growth, which averaged better than 16% over the past decade, slowed to 9% last year. The iPhone faces increased competition from Huawei in China. And the company's debt has climbed to 146% of equity.\n\nNonetheless, I still like Apple. It has a large and loyal following, and a history of successfully pulling rabbits out of hats in product development.\n\nTrack record\n\nEvery year in March, I write about my favorite stocks on the Nasdaq. Over 17 years, the average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 19.20%. The beats the average return on the Nasdaq Composite Index (16.30%) and the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index (13%).\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy picks from a year ago climbed 23.80%, which beat the Nasdaq Composite (20.80%) but not the S&P 500 (31.60%). The best performer was Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (NYSE:TMHC), up 57%. The worst was Cirrus Logic Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS), down 15%.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts. He or his clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column.

        "content": "Shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) charged higher Monday, gaining as much as 7.8%. As of 10:49 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 7.1%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the tech giant higher was reporting that the company may have found its first big licensee for its artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nGemini\n\nAlphabet is reportedly \"in active negotiations\" with Apple to license Google's Gemini to underpin certain AI-powered features in the iPhone, according to a story first reported by Bloomberg. The company may go so far as to integrate Alphabet's suite of AI tools into the device itself, according to the report, which cited \"people familiar with the situation.\"\n\nIf the deal comes to pass, it would be the first clear indication that Alphabet has a market for its AI services beyond its cloud infrastructure offering, Google Cloud. Any such deal would extend an existing partnership between the pair, as Apple offers Google as the default search engine within its Safari web browser.\n\nA huge vote of confidence\n\nIt's still early days for generative AI, and it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Just last month, Alphabet temporarily suspended Gemini's image generation capabilities when it produced inaccurate representations of historical figures. Google took the features offline and apologized, saying: \"Gemini image generation got it wrong. We'll do better.\" This helps to illustrate that even the most advanced generative AI models are still a work in progress.\n\nInvestors have questioned Alphabet's ability to capitalize on the AI opportunity and this is the first sure sign it's headed in the right direction. And the opportunity ahead is vast, though estimates span a wide range. Generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nThat said, Alphabet is still a relative bargain, selling for 26 times earnings, a discount compared to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500. A rebound in the digital advertising market -- Alphabet's bread and butter -- is ongoing, and the potential to profit from AI is significant.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow is the time to buy Alphabet stock before this fire sale is over.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 18, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAs their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAll seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA multi-industry leader has been a popular buy for billionaire investors\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) is pushing deeper into the generative AI space with its latest smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. The processor, which will be available in Android smartphones from Chinese manufacturers including Xiaomi and Honor, is the second addition to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 family.\n\nLike the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm is marketing the 8s Gen 3 as an on-device AI powerhouse. The company says that the processor supports a number of models including Meta's Llama 2 and Google's Gemini Nano.\n\nThe 8s Gen 3 places just below the standard 8 Gen 3 in terms of performance and pricing, meaning you'll likely find it in smartphones that are just under flagship devices. The company says it's taken a number of the major features from the top-of-the-line 8 Gen 3 and dropped them into the 8s Gen 3, including high-powered gaming performance.\n\nBut Qualcomm is largely positioning this chip as a generative AI processor. So far, on-device generative AI features include photo editing and real-time translation. Smartphone makers are increasingly leaning into the technology as a major selling point and the first major software change for devices in some time. Qualcomm is positioning its new Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 as a solid generative AI powerhouse. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nThe smartphone market has largely remained stagnant over the last few years with only incremental changes to cameras and processing speeds. As a result, consumers are more apt to hold onto their devices for longer periods of time, slowing down overall sales.\n\nGenerative AI, however, could be just what the market needs: a new, flashy capability that gets consumers to update their phones as faster clips.\n\nAndroid smartphone makers are taking an early lead with the technology, with both Samsung and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touting their latest offerings as generative AI-capable devices. Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI software during its WWDC developer conference, which will likely take place in June.\n\nWall Street analysts are pointing to generative AI as a potential catalyst for a boost in Apple's next-generation iPhone sales. And while the company hasn't made any announcements regarding what it's cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said he sees generative AI as a \"huge opportunity for Apple\" and that the iPhone maker will show off what it's been developing later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut generative AI apps and features are still in their early stages, and there's nothing quite interesting enough on the market yet to get people to start running out their front doors and into their nearest smartphone shops. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAnd some of the most well-known generative AI apps like ChatGPT are cloud-based, meaning it doesn't matter what kind of chip your smartphone is running; as long as you've got a connection to the internet, you'll likely be able to use the service.\n\nStill, as developers continue to develop the technology and roll it into more and more apps, chips capable of running them like the 8s Gen 3 will become increasingly important for users who want to take advantage of the software.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "An Intrinsic Calculation For Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Suggests It's 33% Undervalued",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Alphabet is US$212 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Alphabet's US$141 share price signals that it might be 33% undervalued Analyst price target for GOOGL is US$164 which is 23% below our fair value estimate\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$78.7b US$90.1b US$105.1b US$122.9b US$134.5b US$143.1b US$150.6b US$157.1b US$162.9b US$168.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x20 Analyst x20 Analyst x11 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.45% Est @ 5.20% Est @ 4.33% Est @ 3.72% Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$73.5k US$78.4k US$85.4k US$93.1k US$95.0k US$94.4k US$92.6k US$90.2k US$87.3k US$84.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$874b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$168b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.3%) = US$3.5t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.5t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$141, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.064. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Interactive Media and Services industry.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Alphabet, we've put together three pertinent factors you should further examine:\n\nFinancial Health: Does GOOGL have a healthy balance sheet?

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Wall Street Most Bullish About: AMD, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You only needed to know one thing over the last year to make a lot of money investing: Buy large-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nearly all of them have delivered sizzling returns.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have been especially big winners. Cloud services providers Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have also taken off.\n\nBut those performances are now history. Which AI stock is Wall Street most bullish about going forward: AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, or Nvidia?\n\nAnalysts give a thumbs down to these AI stocks\n\nWe can quickly eliminate two of these big AI stocks. Wall Street doesn't have great expectations for AMD or Nvidia over the near term.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target for AMD reflects a small decline from the current price. That's not too surprising, considering the stock has skyrocketed more than 130% over the last 12 months. Many analysts seem to think that AMD is due for a breather.\n\nIt's a similar story with Nvidia. The stock has nearly tripled over the last year, thanks to surging demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs). But while that demand doesn't appear to be waning, the consensus on Wall Street is that Nvidia's shares don't have much more room to run. The average price target is a little lower than the current share price.\n\nNot every analyst gives a thumbs down to these two AI chipmakers, though. The most optimistic analysts think that AMD and Nvidia can still soar nearly 40% and 60%, respectively, over the next 12 months.\n\nThe contenders\n\nWall Street is more optimistic about Microsoft. The average price target for the tech giant reflects an upside potential of more than 10%. One analyst predicts that Microsoft's shares could jump more than 30% over the next 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft stands to profit from the AI boom in two key ways. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its software applications. This added functionality will likely attract more customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also the second-biggest cloud services provider with its Azure platform. Organizations are flocking to the cloud to build and deploy AI apps, especially ones focused on generative AI.\n\nHowever, analysts think Alphabet could outperform Microsoft, AMD, and Nvidia over the near term. The average 12-month price target for the stock is roughly 15% above the current price. The most bullish analyst expects Alphabet stock to vault nearly 30% higher.\n\nWhat about the recent embarrassment for Alphabet with Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures? Wall Street doesn't believe it will be more than a temporary speed bump. Like Microsoft, Google has integrated generative AI throughout many of its products. Google Cloud should also continue to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nWall Street's favorite\n\nThat leaves one big AI stock Wall Street likes the most. Amazon's average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of nearly 17%. The company's biggest fan in the analyst community thinks the stock could move close to 30% higher.\n\nAI stands out as one key growth driver for the company. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the leading market share in cloud services and enjoys the same AI tailwind as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n\nAnalysts also recognize how much Amazon's focus on improving profitability and free cash flow is paying off. The e-commerce and cloud services giant's Q4 earnings jumped to $10.6 billion from $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. Free cash flow improved to $36.8 billion for the trailing 12 months, compared to negative free cash flow of $11.6 billion in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nIs Wall Street right that Amazon will be the biggest winner of these five AI stocks over the next 12 months? Maybe. I agree that Amazon's momentum should continue.\n\nOver the long run, though, I expect that AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia will keep up their winning ways. We could look back 20 years from now and still be able to say that the one thing investors needed to know to make a lot of money was to buy large-cap AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best AOL Mail Alternatives in 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the Email Services Industry and AOL Mail\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global email hosting services market was valued at $43.3 billion in 2022. The global email hosting services market is expected to grow to $144.1 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3%. Email hosting services supported by cloud-based enterprise services are driving the industry and are quite popular. Large corporations like Google and Microsoft happen to offer complete enterprise solutions along with email hosting at an affordable price.

        "title": "A 15-year problem that has plagued corporate America is finally turning around",
        "content": "American workers are becoming more productive.\n\nRecent analysis from Bank of America showed the average revenue per worker for companies in the S&P 500 hit an all-time high in Februaryafter 15 years of no gains. This is one of several signs that labor productivity is rebounding after slumping during 2022.\n\nSome on Wall Street think the developments in labor productivity could help the stock market survive stickier-than-expected inflation that has emerged as a concern in recent weeks.\n\n\"If productivity goes higher, then [companies] are able to cut costs, improve margins, things like that,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance. \"That's why companies are so focused on improving productivity. There's a lot of macro headwinds happening. So they are trying to find ways to improve productivity and sort of offset those headwinds.\"\n\nThe headwinds Kwon references include the risk the Federal Reserve holds off on cutting interest rates as inflation's path downward continues to prove bumpier than initially hoped.Two separate reports released this week showed inflation was hotter than economists expected in February. And annual wage growth during the month was higher than what economists have said the Fed wants to see to feel confident inflation is moving down to its 2% target.\n\nThe research team at Carson Group argues an increase in productivity could offset these concerns, though.\n\n\"With productivity soaring like it is and will hopefully continue like it can, you don't have to worry about inflation coming back, you really don't,\" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance.\n\nDetrick's colleague Sonu Varghese explained that persistent wage growth can usually cause an inflation problem if consumers have more money to spend on goods. Demand for goods would rise as workers make more money, therefore pushing prices higher. This paradigm shifts, though, if productivity picks up. In that instance, the economy could sustain higher wages because companies would also be producing more goods. If both the demand and supply of goods pick up, then prices can remain stable.\n\nStory continues\n\nVarghese highlighted two different instances where wage growth surged. In the 1970s, wage growth picked up but productivity didn't, leading to a decade-long battle with persistent inflation. In the 1990s, wage growth gains were met with a productivity boom and subsequently led to a prosperous stretch for both US economic growth and stock market gains.\n\nAs productivity picks up, it increases the overall trajectory of the US economic growth, Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat's welcome news for stocks.\n\nCompanies can choose to use their increased financial gains from productivity in a variety of ways. One would be to keep boosting wages to lure in more workers. But recent shifts in the labor market show that likely won't be the case.\n\nThe labor market has shown some signs of softening and the large pay bumps needed to lure workers in the post-lockdown job market have eased. The quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, hit its lowest level since August 2020 in January.\n\nThis would indicate that companies would take their additional revenues from increased productivity and use them to boost margins. Higher margins are usually a tailwind for future company earnings, which would in theory lift equities.\n\nAll of this comes without a mention of artificial intelligence, which has been lauded as a potential productivity booster.\n\n\"AI is kind of like the cherry on the top,\" Kwon said. \"AI obviously is going to be a huge productivity enhancer. I don't know when that's going to happen. But we do think that is going to happen and be a huge boost to productivity as well.\" Denver Broncos mascot Thunder, ridden by Ann Judge, crosses the field with the American flag after a touchdown in the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Empower Field at Mile High.

        "title": "It's Not Too Late to Invest in Artificial Intelligence: 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year and became one of the biggest growth drivers of the Nasdaq Composite's recovery. The market faced an economic downturn the previous year, which sent countless stocks plunging. However, the Nasdaq Composite is up 44% year over year and climbing, primarily thanks to excitement over AI.\n\nAccording to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The industry hit nearly $200 billion last year, but this trajectory would see it achieve close to $2 trillion by the decade's end. So, despite the market's meteoric rise over the last year, new investors still have much to gain from AI.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks of the tech world -- Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla -- are a great place to start. These companies are investing heavily in AI and have the brand power to go far in the industry. It's not too late to invest in AI, so here are two Magnificent Seven stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's business was brought front and center last year when it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up.\n\nSoaring demand for AI services led to a similar demand for high-powered chips, with Nvidia perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to most of the market. As a result, earnings hit record heights over the last year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% rise in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\n\nThe chipmaker's massive success in AI has also seen its free cash flow soar 430% in 12 months to $27 billion. Comparatively, AMD's is at just over $1 billion, while Intel's is negative $14 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nAfter a monster growth year, some analysts are questioning whether Nvidia has much more to offer. However, the significant potential of AI and the company's powerful market position means it remains an attractive long-term play. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow plunged 45% and 48% over the last year, meaning the company's stock is trading at its best value in months.\n\nAlongside a solid role in AI, Nvidia is a Magnificent Seven stock that is too good to pass up.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIt's impossible to deny Alphabet's top spot in tech, with brands like Android, YouTube, and Google attracting billions of users worldwide. The popularity of these products enabled Alphabet to achieve a leading 25% market share in digital advertising and become the world's sixth most valuable company by market cap.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on its expanding AI efforts over the last year. At the end of 2023, the company debuted Gemini, a large language model that looked likely to make Alphabet competitive against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nYet the Google parent's stock was down 7% in the last month after a disappointing launch for Gemini. Alphabet recently held a presentation for the new AI model, and Gemini gave inaccurate depictions of historical figures and failed to recognize key differences between other prominent figures. The blunders forced Alphabet to take its AI image services offline for now.\n\nDespite recent failures, Alphabet remains an attractive way to invest in AI over the long haul. Last year, the company hit $70 billion in free cash flow, more than Microsoft or Amazon. The company has the financial resources to keep investing in its business and the brand power to attract users to its services. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nFurthermore, the table above shows that Alphabet has the lowest P/E and second-to-lowest price-to-free-cash-flow of all of the Magnificent Seven. As a result, Alphabet's stock is a bargain compared to its rivals, making it a lower-risk way to invest in AI.\n\nIn addition to a range of immensely popular brands, Alphabet is one of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Extraordinary Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Over long periods, Wall Street has demonstrated that it's a wealth-building machine. But over shorter timelines, it's also proven to be unpredictable and quite volatile. Over the previous four years, Wall Street's major stock indexes have alternated between bear and bull markets in successive years. These swings have been especially noticeable for the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite shed a third of its value. But since the start of 2023, it's been nothing but green pastures for growth stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining a blistering 54% and reaching an all-time high. There's absolutely no question that Wall Street and the Nasdaq are in the midst of a new bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut just because the Nasdaq Composite has soared, it doesn't mean amazing deals can't be found. With the \"Magnificent Seven\" accounting for an outsized percentage of the Nasdaq's ascent, deals remain for opportunistic investors willing to seek them out.\n\nWhat follows are four extraordinary growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nPayPal Holdings\n\nThe first phenomenal growth stock that could have investors kicking themselves for not taking the plunge -- even with the Nasdaq hitting new highs -- is fintech leader PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL). Despite concerns about increased competition in the digital payments space, PayPal's operating results suggest it maintains a competitive edge.\n\nBefore digging into the specifics, understand that fintech should be a sustained double-digit growth opportunity throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond. The adoption rate for digital payments is still ramping up, which should produce a hearty growth runway for PayPal.\n\nWhat's really stood out about PayPal has been the sheer volume of payments traversing its network, which includes Venmo. Last year, total payment volume surged 12% to $1.53 trillion on a currency-neutral basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, active accounts are completing a greater number of transactions over time. When 2020 came to a close, active PayPal accounts averaged just shy of 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. As of the close of 2023, payment transactions per active account had risen to 58.7 on a TTM basis.\n\nPayPal is predominantly a fee-driven business. If transactions per active accounts continues to climb, PayPal's gross profit should rise, too.\n\nInvestors would also be wise not to overlook the importance of new CEO Alex Chriss's plans to improve upon existing product offerings and launch new services, all while keeping the company's costs under control. Prior to joining PayPal in late September, Chriss was one of the leading figures at Intuit's Small Business division. He has a keen understanding of what smaller businesses want, as well as how to keep costs in check.\n\nThe cherry on top is that PayPal shares can be scooped up for a little north of 11 times forward-year earnings, which is historically cheap for this fintech innovator.\n\nFiverr International\n\nA second extraordinary growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite decisively entering a bull market is online-services marketplace Fiverr International(NYSE: FVRR). In spite of persistent concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) could hamper its freelancer-fueled operating model, Fiverr's abundance of competitive advantages suggests it's nothing short of a bargain.\n\nOn a macro basis, Fiverr has benefited handsomely from a shift in the labor market following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people have returned to the office, a considerably higher percentage of workers are now remote. This is excellent news for a company that aims to connect freelancers with businesses that need their services.\n\nFiverr's online marketplace is another reason for its success. Whereas many of its competitors allow freelancers to list their services at an hourly rate, Fiverr freelancers are pricing their jobs as completed tasks. This provides unparalleled price transparency, which has steadily increased spending per buyer on the platform.\n\nTo add to this, Fiverr's investments in AI have driven gross merchandise value higher. While the returns have been modest, thus far, AI looks to be a help, not a hindrance, to this top-notch gig economy stock.\n\nHowever, the single greatest reason to trust in Fiverr, from an investment standpoint, is the company's take rate. The \"take rate\" describes the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform, including fees, it gets to keep. While most of its peers have take rates in the mid-to-high teens, Fiverr's expanded to 31.8% in the December-ended quarter. It's taking a bigger piece of the pie and seeing active buyers spend more each quarter. This is a recipe that should generate a superior operating margin within its industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical\n\nThe third marvelous growth stock that's begging to be bought in the young Nasdaq bull market is specialty biotech company BioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN). Though BioMarin's TTM price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 100 is bound to scare some value investors away, a consensus annualized earnings growth rate of 43% over the next five years should be music to growth investors' ears.\n\nTo start with, BioMarin enjoys the benefits of being in the highly defensive healthcare sector. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. or global economy, patients taking brand-name drugs developed by BioMarin will continue to need those therapies in any climate. This means the company's cash flow is always predictable and transparent.\n\nWhat tends to differentiate BioMarin Pharmaceutical from other drug developers is its focus on ultrarare-disease drugs. Brand-name treatments that are focused on small groups of patients can be risky, but also rewarding. In addition to tackling an ailment that has few or no treatment options, ultrarare-disease drugs have limited competition and face minimal pushback on their list prices from health insurers.\n\nBioMarin's biggest growth opportunity at the moment lies with dwarfism drug Voxzogo. Increased uptake, strong pricing power, and potential label expansion opportunities for Voxzogo have the ability to eventually propel annual sales to north of $1 billion. For context, Voxzogo sales rose by 178% in 2023 to about $470 million.\n\nTo round things out, BioMarin Pharmaceutical is well capitalized and fully capable of continuing to successfully develop rare-disease drugs internally. It closed out 2023 with $1.68 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various short-and-long-term investments. New drug launches, label expansions, and pricing power have the potential to sustain sales growth of 10% or more throughout the decade.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe fourth extraordinary growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than Magnificent Seven member Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). In spite of a challenging advertising environment, Alphabet makes for a genius buy.\n\nAlthough recessions are known for wreaking havoc on ad-driven businesses, these impacts tend to be short lived. While only three of 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months, there have been two periods of growth that reached at least 10 years over the same span. Patient investors tend to prosper in ad-focused companies.\n\nAlphabet's primary cash-flow driver for the moment is its world-leading internet search engine, Google. In February, Google accounted for nearly 92% of global internet search share. In fact, it's been nine years since Google last held less than a 90% monthly share of worldwide internet search. Being a practical monopoly in internet search means Google can command exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut what shareholders are likely to be most excited about is growth from Alphabet's ancillary operations. For instance, Google Cloud has grown into the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider by spending, according to tech analysis firm Canalys. More importantly, Google Cloud generates considerably juicier margins than advertising, and this segment delivered its first profitable year in 2023.\n\nDon't sleep on YouTube, either. YouTube is the second-most visited social site on the planet, with approximately 2.5 billion monthly active users.\n\nOne of the fastest-growing innovations within YouTube is short-form videos known as \"Shorts.\" Since being introduced in 2021, the average number of daily views of Shorts has grown from 6.5 billion to north of 50 billion in early 2023. Whether it's additional ad revenue or premium subscriptions, Shorts are a cash-flow driver for YouTube and its parent company.\n\nLastly, Alphabet stock is historically inexpensive. Among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have lifted the Nasdaq to new heights, it's the cheapest relative to both forward P/E ratio and multiple to cash flow.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and PayPal made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 11, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank said on Saturday that Google had misquoted the ringgit's exchange rate, undervaluing the currency against the dollar, and that it would seek an explanation from the tech giant.\n\nThe ringgit, which declined to a 26-year low last month, has weakened about 2.44% this year. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has said the currency is undervalued and does not reflect Malaysia's positive economic fundamentals.\n\nThe bank said in a statement that Alphabet Inc's Google published \"inaccurate\" information on Friday and had also done so on Feb. 6.\n\n\"As this is the second instance of misreporting, BNM will be engaging Google for an explanation of how the inaccurate reporting occurred and the corrective measures taken given that this is a recurring issue that has afflicted Malaysia and other countries in the past few months,\" BNM said in a statement.\n\nIt did not elaborate. Google was not immediately available for comment outside of U.S. business hours.\n\nThe search giant does not verify data provided by financial exchanges and other content providers, and disclaims any obligation to do so, according to disclaimers on its website.\n\nGoogle quoted the ringgit at 4.98 to the dollar on Friday, BNM said, while the Malaysian currency's weakest level on official data was 4.7075.\n\nBNM quoted the ringgit at 4.7015 at 9 a.m. and 4.7045 at 5 p.m. on the onshore interbank market. For comparison, LSEG data used by many international market participants quotes a Friday close of 4.7020.\n\nBNM Governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said last week Malaysia's government and central bank were taking coordinated action to further increase flows into the foreign exchange market to ensure the ringgit remains stable.\n\n(Reporting by Danial Azhar; Editing by William Mallard)",

        "content": "(Adds CCI directive on length of investigation in paragraph 4, background throughout)\n\nNEW DELHI/BENGALURU, March 15 (Reuters) - India's antitrust body on Friday ordered a probe into Alphabet Inc's Google in an ongoing dispute with local startups over its in-app billing system, saying the U.S. company implemented its policies in a \"discriminatory manner\".\n\nIndian startups have been at odds with Google for months over the fee it charges for in-app payments. The dispute escalated earlier this month after Google removed more than 100 Indian apps from its app store for violations related to billing, though it restored them after the Indian government intervened.\n\nThe startups had asked the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to look into the matter, and the watchdog on Friday ordered an investigation saying \"Google is implementing its policies in a discriminatory manner\".\n\nThe CCI also directed its investigation unit to complete the probe within 60 days.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\n\nThe dispute centres on efforts by some Indian startups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11% to 26% on in-app payments, after the country's antitrust authorities ordered it to dismantle a system of charging 15% to 30% in 2022.\n\nGoogle denies wrongdoing and says it charges the fee for supporting investments in Google Play app store and the Android mobile operating system, ensuring it distributes it for free.\n\nThe CCI has already spent months looking into startups' complaint that Google is not following the earlier antitrust directive that prevents it from taking adverse measures against companies which use alternate billing systems.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Tanvi Mehta in New Delhi and Hritam Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by YP Rajesh and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

Notably, this marked its first expansion outside Phoenix.\r\n\r\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in the San Francisco Peninsula in addition to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWaymo’s growing footprint in Phoenix, AZ, where it started operating its robotaxi first, remains noteworthy. The expansion of the operating area of Waymo One in the city, which now includes rides to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is another plus.\r\n\r\nWaymo’s effort to expand its operations to downtown Phoenix is another positive. It also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter’s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is a remarkable deal.\r\n\r\nWaymo is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA, and Austin, TX. Notably, Austin is marked as the fourth autonomous ride-hailing city after San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nPer a Precedence Research report, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $2.35 trillion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 35% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors’ confidence in the days ahead. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Alphabet has gained 42.6% in the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGL Ups Competitive Game\n\nWaymo’s growing footprint across the United States has taken the autonomous vehicle competition to another level.\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors GM, which is also leaving no stone unturned to boost the operations of its autonomous driving arm, Cruise, is facing stiff competition from Alphabet.\r\n\r\nGOOGL gets a competitive edge over General Motors, as Cruise is currently facing scrutiny after an accident in which a Cruise car dragged a pedestrian 20 feet.\r\n\r\nExpanding Waymo’s efforts will continue to strengthen Alphabet’s competitive position against Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU, which are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nZoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.\r\n\r\nIt also plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing facility for its autonomous vehicles. The facility will be located at Hayward Exchange @ 92, 25810 Clawiter Rd. The facility is being built to expand Zoox’s presence in the East Bay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.\r\n\r\nApollo Go is available in ten cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 7’ European Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at some European stocks liked by Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Likes These Super 3 European Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in one of his latest programs on CNBC that the US stock market isn’t the only one with the “breadth” problem, referring to the phenomenon where most of the stock market gains last year came from a handful of mega-cap tech stocks or Magnificent Seven stocks which include companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cramer said that the concentration of stock market gains is much higher in the European stock market. Cramer shared some data to back this point which was published by Citi’s equity research team led by Dr. Beata Manthey. He said that in January and February this year, just five stocks in Europe accounted for about 45% of the total gains of MSCI Europe Index.\n\nJim Cramer Shares a New \"Shopping List\" of Stocks for 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that analysts at Citi recently ran a screen for mega-cap European stocks with characteristics similar to Magnificent Seven stocks in the US: high earnings growth, solid margins and strong economic moat. Cramer said Citi analysts believe these stocks have lower valuations when compared to their US counterparts and have more room to run in the future. As you will see later in this article, Cramer also believes several of these seven stocks in Europe have a lot of growth potential.\n\nJim Cramer said that Citi’s Super Seven list “makes for a great list of companies.”\n\nHowever, Jim Cramer did emphasize that he cannot recommend investors to start piling into these stocks immediately since most of them are trading at their all-time highs. Cramer said that it would make him look a “little crazy” to recommend stocks that already had a “huge run.” But Jim Cramer urged his viewers to see these companies as a “shopping list” of high quality stocks that “could be very attractive” on pullback.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Likes These Super 7 European Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent program on CNBC in which he walked his viewers through Citi's Dr. Beata Manthey's Super Seven European stocks and shared his bullish thoughts on these companies. Cramer thinks these stocks should be bought on a pullback.\n\n7. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJim Cramer recently quoted Citi and said the “leader” of the Super Seven group of stocks is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Cramer said it’s “obvious” that the pharmaceutical company is the leader of the group. Cramer said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) was the company which originally came up with GLP-1 drugs for diabetes. He said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is “years ahead” of his American favorite weight loss stock Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer said that recently it was revealed that the GLP-1 pill Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is developing could be much more effective than the one being developed by Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer also highlighted the FDA’s recent approval for Novo Nordisk's (NYSE:NVO) drug for heart disease. Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) said the FDA approved its weight-loss drug Wegovy for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight or obese people with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nCramer said that it “can’t go wrong with either of these stocks” as he believes more Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has more room for growth.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“As we discussed in last quarter’s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.”\n\n6. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the European stocks in the Super Seven group recommended by Citi and liked by Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer said ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is operating in the semiconductor equipment sector where there’s limited competition and ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) remains “unrivaled.” Cramer said that ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) has a “monopoly” in making equipment that is required to make advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) excellent stock performance, since the stock is up 58% over the past one year and 33% in 2024 through March 14. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) stock has been roaring after ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) posted a blockbuster quarterly report in January. Cramer seemed especially excited about ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) net bookings which came in at a whopping  €9.2 billion, compared to the Street’s estimate of just €3.57 billion.\n\nIn addition to ASML, Jim Cramer likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\n5. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY)\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is another important member of the Super Seven group of European stocks. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is very “exciting” for “a lot of people out there.” Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. Cramer named some of the top brands of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) which include Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Givenchy, Dior, Fendi, among many others.\n\nJim Cramer said that one of the strengths of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is its target market — the rich. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) posted a “blowout” quarter in January and the stock has been a “phenomenal” performer. He believes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) stock can “keep winning” but recommended investors to wait for a pullback to buy it.\n\nHere is what  Distillate Capital has to say about LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“After rebalancing, Distillate’s International FSV strategy offers a higher free cash flow yield both to market cap and enterprise value, and has substantially more stable fundamentals and less leverage than the index. The largest new position is LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY), where estimated free cash ϲows are up year-to-date while the stock is down.”\n\n4. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNext on the list of the Super Seven group of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), the Germany-based software company. Cramer said SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) “took its time” to adjust to the “new world” of Cloud computing but eventually caught up and now it’s making “big money” off of artificial intelligence. Jim Cramer praised the stock’s run over the past several months (it’s up about 64% over the past one year) and said it’s “probably not done.” Cramer also said that he “should have caught it” but he was focusing more on ServiceNow. Cramer is also bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The biggest stakeholder of SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) during this period was Ken Fisher which had an $820 million stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Like Workday and Amazon, SAP SE’s (NYSE:SAP) stock price rose significantly in Q4 after the company reported its Q3 2023 earnings. Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both robust cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive.\n\nWe also view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of its customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back.”\n\nTo see rest of the stocks in this list click Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 3’ European Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 15, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, McDonald's Corp. MCD, RTX Corp. RTX, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Southern Copper Corp. SCCO.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Alphabet, McDonald's and RTX\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., McDonald's Corp. and RTX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have gained +51.2% over the past year, in-line with the Zacks Tech sector’s gain of +51.5%, but significantly better than the S&P 500 index's +31.9% gain. The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s strong efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Also, its expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. However, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nMcDonald's shares have gained +8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s gain of +11.6%. The company is likely to benefit from strong comps performance, marketing campaigns and a loyalty program. During fourth-quarter 2023, McDonald's U.K. solidified its position as a go-to destination for quality food at exceptional value, thus, boosting customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nMcDonald's is also increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods. Also, the focus on Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well.\r\n\r\nEarnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism about the stock’s growth potential. Yet, macroeconomic challenges and commodity and wage inflation are primary headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald’s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+21.1% vs. +12.2%). The company continues to receive ample orders from the Pentagon and its foreign allies for its wide range of combat-proven defense products.\r\n\r\nA steadily recovering commercial air traffic, both domestic and international, is expected to bolster commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position which should enable it to make successful share repurchase.\r\n\r\nHowever, the appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock. Also, as rising crude price tends to put cost pressure on airlines, operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX may be impacted. The company might also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against RTX’s missile and defense unit.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corp. and Southern Copper Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Ranked From Cheapest to Most Expensive",
        "content": "For more than a year, Wall Street has been putting smiles on most investors' faces. Following bear market declines in 2022 for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite, all three major stock indexes have powered their way to record-closing highs in 2024.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of factors that have fed the current bull market, such as a lower inflation rate and the continued strength of the U.S. economy, much of the heavy lifting has fallen on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's most influential businesses\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most prominent businesses on the planet in terms of both aggregate sales and innovation. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from handily outperforming all three major stock indexes over long periods, the Magnificent Seven offer sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is the dominant provider of desktop operating systems (Windows) and has seen its share of global cloud infrastructure service spend jump to 25%, thanks to Azure. Apple's iPhone has accounted for around half or more of the U.S. smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable. The company has also bought back a jaw-dropping $651 billion of its own stock in 11 years. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a virtual monopoly (90%-plus share) of GPUs in use in high-compute data centers this year. Amazon leads in two categories. It's the far-and-away biggest player in e-commerce and held a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend via Amazon Web Services (AWS), as of September 2023. Alphabet's Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search, with close to 92% of worldwide share in February. Alphabet also owns the second-most-visited social site (YouTube) and the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms is the owner of Facebook, the most visited social site in the world. Collectively, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and other apps, Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users to its social media \"real estate.\" Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nWhile all seven of these components have been phenomenal long-term investments, their outlooks going forward could differ greatly -- and that all starts with their valuations.\n\nRanking the Magnificent Seven stocks from cheapest to priciest using a common valuation tool\n\nTo be upfront, analyzing the valuations of public companies can be subjective. What one investor believes is pricey, another might view as an incredible deal. Likewise, fundamental metrics are fluid and constantly changing as companies report their operating results and Wall Street analysts react to this data.\n\nNevertheless, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has stood the test of time as the most rudimentary measure of value for public companies. But since Wall Street is forward-looking, utilizing the forward P/E ratio, which takes into account consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the upcoming year, makes the most sense.\n\nBased on consensus estimates from Wall Street, as of the closing bell on March 13, here's how the Magnificent Seven ranked from cheapest to priciest using this common valuation tool:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 17.83 forward P/E ratio Meta Platforms: 21.56 Apple: 23.9 Nvidia: 30.43 Microsoft: 31.07 Amazon: 33.95 Tesla: 41.14\n\nTo offer some context, the forward P/E ratios for the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq 100 are 21.1 and 31.32, respectively.\n\nBased purely on earnings potential for the coming year, Amazon and Tesla appear relatively pricey, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms look like bargains. The latter is particularly interesting, given that Meta has more than quintupled since its 2022 bear market bottom yet remains attractively valued, based on consensus EPS estimates for the company.\n\nHowever, the forward P/E ratio doesn't provide the most complete story in terms of valuation. While it can be a helpful tool for assessing mature businesses, an even better measure of value exists for the generally faster-growing and innovation-driven Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the smartest way to rank the Magnificent Seven from cheapest to most expensive\n\nIn addition to being dominant within their respective industries, the Magnificent Seven share another trait: They tend to reinvest a sizable percentage of their operating cash flow back into their respective businesses. In other words, they're willing to forgo maximum profits in the short term to invest in higher-growth initiatives that could really fuel their growth rates years down the road.\n\nRather than relying on the forward P/E ratio, analyzing the multiple that each company trades at relative to its forward-year consensus cash flow is a considerably smarter way to value these dominant businesses.\n\nHere's how the Magnificent Seven stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive when examined relative to next year's cash flow:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 12.53 times next year's cash consensus cash flow Amazon: 12.8 Meta Platforms: 13.19 Apple: 21.1 Microsoft: 24.15 Tesla: 27.38 Nvidia: 30.59\n\nOn one hand, Microsoft, Tesla, and especially Nvidia are making it tougher for growth seekers to find value. Tesla's operating margin is falling as it slashes prices on its production models in order to keep inventory levels under control. Meanwhile, Nvidia is set to face a laundry list of headwinds -- including AI GPU competition from many of its top customers (which are Magnificent Seven components).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Amazon is historically inexpensive, relative to its future cash flow. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of net sales, Amazon could see its cash-flow growth handily outpace its annual sales growth. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms confirms that it's still a potential bargain at just 13 times forward-year cash flow.\n\nBut the best deal within the Magnificent Seven is Alphabet, which also happens to be the cheapest constituent when using the forward P/E ratio.\n\nAlphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be Google. With a nearly 92% share of worldwide internet search, Google is the logical go-to for advertisers looking to target their message(s) to specific consumers. More often than not, this will give Google exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet's advertising segments benefiting from long-winded economic expansions, Google Cloud looks like a force to be reckoned with. After years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered its first operating profit in 2023.\n\nCloud service margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and enterprise cloud spending is likely in its early innings. In short, this segment may be Alphabet's prime source of cash-flow growth throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal among the Magnificent Seven stocks, the data suggests you can't go wrong with Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Believe It or Not, Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still Isn’t Expensive",
        "content": "Chipmaker and AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its unstoppable upward journey, having more than tripled in value in 2023 and up about 78% year-to-date. The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\n\nNVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again\n\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share handily beat the analysts’ estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\n\nImportantly, NVDA’s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\n\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\n\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, “We’re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing… [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive\n\nNVDA is Wall Street’s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia’s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What’s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA’s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\n\nNVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock Split\n\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn’t inherently alter the company’s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\n\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple’s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\n\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\n\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA’s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.\n\nThe insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.\n\nWith NVDA’s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "11 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of cybersecurity stocks and the industry, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\n\nWhile most attention this year has focused on artificial intelligence, space exploration, or weight loss drugs, quietly in the background, one sector has reminded everyone once again that it is just as important as any other industry. This sector is none other than cybersecurity, and as we settle into 2024, a war of sorts has broken out in the digital world.\n\nIf you've been unfortunate enough to have dealt with the healthcare system over the past month, then it's possible that you faced a disruption on the insurance front. If so, then this was because the systems of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)'s business division Change Healthcare were hacked, which led to a suspension of insurance claims processing at pharmacies across several areas. Immediately after the attack, reports surfaced that the ransomware group BlackHat might be responsible, as it had vowed to target healthcare facilities after the U.S. Justice Department had shared in December 2023 that it had conducted a massive operation against the group to seize its digital assets and other tools. It later turned out that the suspicions were correct, with UnitedHealth's vice president confirming the fact in a statement given to TechCrunch.\n\nSince the hack led to pharmacies and hospitals being unable to process payments, it resulted in a cash shortage as healthcare providers were unable to make their payments on time but had to provide services to patients and customers at the same time. However, despite its scale, the ransomware attack isn't the only cybersecurity threat that has been in the news lately. One of the biggest technology stocks and companies in the world, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the choir in March 2024 when it shared that a Russian hacker gang's data breach in January that led to the leaking of data of Microsoft employees was being used for another cyberattack. While the Russian embassy in the U.S. does not respond to Microsoft's allegations, the firm is quite persistent with them, and the latest attack led cybersecurity professionals to worry that perhaps the hackers were trying to embed backdoors in Microsoft's software products.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these striking developments, one would wonder that perhaps investing in cybersecurity stocks is a sound decision. After all, the copious amounts of data generated and stored every day create incentives for nefarious actors to try their hand at quick riches, and in the process, it also generates demand for cybersecurity products. Companies that provide cybersecurity services, such as Gen Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:GEN) are typically classified as cybersecurity stocks, but due to the polar nature of the technology industry where giants like Microsoft dominate several industries, other firms such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are also key players in the industry. For those out of the loop, Alphabet's cybersecurity division Mandiant was at the center of efforts to determine the roots of UnitedHealth's ransomware attack, after Google bought the firm for a cool $5.4 billion in 2022.\n\nSo, as the thinking goes, since there are more cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity stocks are great to invest in as more global organizations look towards them to secure infrastructure and data worth billions of dollars. To check whether this hypothesis holds water, let's take a look at the performance of the S&P Kensho Cyber Security Index. The group of stocks that seek to provide digital security services to businesses is up by a respectable 35% over the past twelve months, a time period that has not only seen law enforcement fend off ransomware gangs but also a complicated global political landscape in which Chinese hackers like the uniquely named \"Volt Typhoon\" roam free. Year to date, the stock index's price appreciation dimmed down to 4.5%, as technology stocks experienced a broader lift on the back of investor hopes of interest rate cuts in 2024 despite inflation being higher than what the Federal Reserve's public statements would prefer.\n\nIn a world beset with physical and digital threats, it's also important to see what the smart money thinks when it comes to cybersecurity stocks. On this front, here is what Artisan Partners' fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter had to say about the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD):\n\nTop-performing securities CrowdStrike Holdings, a security software provider, reported strong earnings results – driven by strength in cloud security and identity protection – with a better than expected profitability profile. Cyber threats remain elevated, and it is likely that the rise of artificial intelligence will make it easier for criminals to generate and scale more sophisticated attacks, which could increase the demand for CrowdStrike products in the years ahead.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks according to analysts. A couple of names are Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), Telos Corporation (NASDAQ:TLS), and Arqit Quantum Inc. (NASDAQ:ARQQ). 11 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nPhoto by Obie Fernandez on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy according to analysts, we ranked the U.S. traded holdings of the Global X Cybersecurity ETF  by their average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked out the top stocks.\n\nFor these undervalued cybersecurity stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com’s self-driving car unit, Zoox, is seeking to stay abreast of rival Waymo by expanding its vehicles’ testing in California and Nevada to include a wider area, higher speeds and nighttime driving.\n\nThe changes, announced on Thursday, apply to Zoox's fleet of vehicles that it designed and built itself. Those resemble toaster ovens on wheels and lack manual controls inside, like steering wheels, pedals and gear shifters. Zoox also operates retrofitted self-driving Toyota Highlanders in Seattle, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Foster City, California.\n\nThe moves are modest compared with Alphabet’s Waymo, which this week announced a plan to begin a taxi service in Los Angeles, on top of the existing markets of San Francisco and Phoenix, where it already ferries passengers in its retrofitted autonomous Jaguars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZoox said it will free up its specially designed vehicles to drive at speeds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph), from 35 mph. It also expanded the Las Vegas area in which the cars can travel to five miles from one mile, it said in a statement. “Driving in these larger areas exposes our robotaxis to the busiest conditions they’ve ever encountered,” the company said.\n\nThe Zoox vehicles will also drive in light rain and at night, the company said, critical for gathering additional data.\n\nLike rivals, Zoox is hoping to one day replace human drivers with full self-driving vehicles that technologists say are safer and more reliable because they do not succumb to human error. Zoox has not given a timeline for when it thinks its fully autonomous vehicles will be ubiquitous.\n\nRival General Motors’ Cruise halted testing of its robotaxis last year after regulators alleged executives had withheld evidence from an accident in San Francisco in which a Cruise vehicle struck and dragged a woman about 20 feet (6.1 m)after she was hit by a human-driven car.\n\nAmazon bought Zoox in 2020 for more than $1 billion, leading to speculation it could eventually use the cars as delivery vehicles, sparing it the cost of paying for drivers. Zoox has not made any announcements about its plans beyond as robotaxis.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

The approval of spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January, along with enthusiasm about the next halving event expected in late April, which will the cut the supply of newly mined Bitcoin in half, has helped attract a wave of new US investors to the asset. Still, search interest does not necessarily signal purchase intent. The last time Bitcoin saw this level of search interest was in June 2022, when the token dropped nearly 40% in a single week.\n\nOver the Super Bowl weekend in early February, searches for Swift were 14 times higher than they were for Bitcoin. But, a March spike in search interest for the digital asset has quickly inversed that relationship, with Bitcoin seeing an average search rating of 53 in the last week, compared to Swift and Beyoncé, who had average search ratings of 38 and nine, respectively. Google Trends data does not display raw search numbers, but uses an index from zero to 100 to show relative search popularity.\n\nA series of market setbacks and high-profile criminal cases has hurt retail interest in Bitcoin over recent years, mirroring some of the anxiety that Swift writes about in her “Anti-Hero” song from late 2022. Despite the token setting a new all-time high for five of the last seven days, search interest has still not hit the highs it saw back in 2021, when it reached its previous high.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the collection of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has seen nearly $12 billion of net inflows since their launch. Bitcoin was lower by 2.7%, after setting an all-time of $73,797 on Thursday.\n\n(Adds the price change in the last paragraph. An earlier update corrected Bitcoin’s average search rating to 53 in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

        "content": "Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) already made a big success after it eased concerns over being smashed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). Then it kicked off 2024 by showing its AI-powered-search engine contribution to the grocery shopping revolution with which it entered the long-dominated territory of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nRetail-centered generative AI search engine is giving Google a run for its money.\n\nWalmart bravely entered the field that Google has dominated since the very beginning. Although Google is not threatened directly as its search engine is used far beyond retail, Walmart’s success still could inflict harm on the world's most widely used search engine. Instead of sending users to Google and other online destinations, Walmart has been using generative AI as of January to help users arrange an event, taking into account location, search history, and other contextual information. During the unveiling preview in January, Walmart also hinted at developing a generative AI-powered search feature where users would be able to ask for a themed party and receive all the relevant items as a result.\n\nWhat also helped Walmart is that Alphabet and Google released Gemini generative AI before it was ready at the same time. But despite acknowledging the mistake, Alphabet continues to commit significant funds and efforts to further develop Gemini along with more specialized AI tools to integrate within retail ecosystems, such as Conversational Commerce tools from Google Cloud that allows businesses to use virtual AI-powered customers service agents.\n\nBut the bottom line is that Walmart is only doing what everyone else is, led by titans such as Amazon. For example, Amazon users can converse with an AI shopping assistant about what they need instead of searching for specific products. It just pulled it off quickly and is using the technology wisely.\n\nAutomatic replenishment feature.\n\nMoreover, Walmart is envisioning a future where grocery shopping is done hands-free, such as a fully stocked fridge that magically replenishes itself. AI-powered InHome replenishment service aims to automate the entire grocery shopping process, based on the combination of individual consumer habits and Walmart's extensive knowledge of general shopping patterns. If successful, Walmart will be surpassing Amazon and its Subscribe-and-Save model as Amazon is yet to utilize AI for this purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart took its place in the gen-AI era in the making.\n\nWhat should worry Google and Amazon is the speed at which Walmart employed generative AI to enhance its offerings, breaking the pattern of everyone going to Google for everything. Generative AI is democratizing opportunities that used to be unavailable and Walmart has successfully positioned itself as an innovator, worthy of being next to the titans themselves such as Google and Amazon.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

It is an issue for this to be on everybody's phone,\" he said. \"When you have this app on everybody's phone it has the ability to collect an awful lot of data. It should be owned by US businesses. There's no way that the Chinese would ever let a US company own something like this in China.\"\n\nMnuchin's task won't be easy. During the interview he admitted that the app would need to be rebuilt in the US using US technology. But TikTok's secret sauce is the algorithm that keeps users scrolling through while waiting for class to start and through their lunch breaks.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nWashington, as well as states and municipalities across the country, has been working to kill TikTok for years on fears that the data TikTok collects can be used to manipulate users or gather information about them that amounts to a national security threat.\n\nBut, so far, no government agency has managed to provide a succinct explanation as to what that threat entails. Free speech advocates, meanwhile, have come forward saying that killing TikTok would violate Americans' First Amendment rights. As a result, the legislation is all but guaranteed to face legal challenges if it does pass the Senate and is signed by President Biden.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Could be a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Right Now",
        "content": "Investors have been rushing out to buy artificial intelligence (AI) stocks due to the technology's potential to revolutionize so many industries -- and our daily routines. Companies that either offer AI services to others or use AI themselves could see their revenue take off in the coming years, and if you invest in them today, you could benefit.\n\nThere are plenty of AI stocks out there so you may struggle to choose just one, and the good news is you don't have to -- it's likely many companies will become AI winners down the road. But today, one particular player represents a once-in-a generation investment opportunity. This company happens to be part of a group of industry leaders dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" after the 1960 Western.\n\nThese stocks have advanced in recent years thanks to their earnings growth, their investment in new technologies such as AI, and their future growth prospects. But one in particular -- a market giant with an enormous competitive advantage -- remains surprisingly cheap, making it a fantastic buy right now. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven include companies known for powering today's economy, and as a result, the companies hold top positions in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.\n\nThey are:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent of top search engine Google.\n\nAmazon, a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing.\n\nApple, maker of leading devices including the iPhone and Mac.\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and a suite of social media apps.\n\nMicrosoft, a global software giant.\n\nNvidia, the world's top seller of AI chips.\n\nTesla, the leading electric vehicle maker.\n\nToday, one stands out for its potential to benefit from AI along with its terrific moat and the fact that it's trading for a song. I'm talking about Alphabet. The stock has climbed more than 50% over the past year, and it still trades for only 20x forward earnings estimates, down from more than 30 about two years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nA new phase of growth ahead\n\nThe stock may not stay this cheap for long though as Alphabet potentially enters a new phase of growth -- driven by AI. And this should build on the solid foundation the company has put into place over the years, growing earnings into the billions of dollars and establishing a secure moat. GOOG Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nThe moat, or competitive advantage, is Alphabet's brand strength in the search market -- \"Googling\" things has become part of people's routines. Google Search has steadily held more than 90% of the global search market, and due to this already impressive market position and Alphabet's investment in AI, that's unlikely to change.\n\nSo, how is AI helping Alphabet keep its leadership? The company recently launched Gemini, its most powerful AI model yet, and the Gemini update -- and Alphabet is using its AI platform across its businesses from cloud services to search.\n\nAI is helping search to produce better results than ever, adding new elements such as summaries and links that offer various perspectives on the subject. And AI also is helping advertisers seamlessly create their campaigns. These two points are key because they strengthen the case for advertisers to keep coming back to Alphabet -- and Google ads make up the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue.\n\nGoogle Cloud's sales growth\n\nThis hot technology also should help Alphabet in a smaller business but one with great momentum and significant growth potential. I'm talking about Google Cloud. The business may hold less market share than rival Amazon's Amazon Web Services, but the revenue growth rate has been higher in recent times. In the most recent quarter, Google Cloud revenue jumped 25% while AWS revenue increased 13%.\n\nAlphabet said that its AI expertise helped it to expand its cloud work with many top companies in the quarter including McDonald's and Verizon. The cloud business offers customers a variety of AI strengths -- from the Vertex AI Platform to train and deploy AI models to a coding companion and hardware for AI workloads. And these are just a few examples.\n\nWe're in the early days of AI growth, with some analysts predicting the market will reach more than $1 trillion by 2030. Alphabet, already a powerhouse in its market, is well positioned to benefit from this once-in-a-generation technological revolution -- and that makes Alphabet, at its price today, a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robotaxis will begin cruising the streets of Los Angeles on Thursday when Google spinoff Waymo starts offering free rides to some of the roughly 50,000 people who have signed up for its driverless ride-hailing service.\n\nWaymo is expanding into Los Angeles, the second largest U.S. city, seven months after California regulators authorized its robotaxis to begin charging for around-the-clock rides throughout San Francisco. That came despite objections from local officials who asserted the driverless vehicles posed unacceptable risks to public safety.\n\nAlthough Waymo isn't charging for rides in its robotaxis in Los Angeles to start, the company said in a blog post announcing the expansion that it will eventually collect fares from passengers there too. Waymo also hopes to begin commercial operations in Austin, Texas, later this year, a goal that makes its robotaxi service available in four major U.S. cities 15 years after it began as a secret project within Google. Waymo's robotaxis have been charging for rides in Phoenix since 2020.\n\nFor now, Waymo's free rides in Los Angeles will cover a 63-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) area spanning from Santa Monica to downtown.\n\nWaymo is launching operations in Los Angeles two weeks after the California Public Utilities Commission approved the expansion in a decision that once again overrode the concerns of city transportation officials about robotaxis coming to sudden stops that block roads and the potential for driverless vehicles to malfunction in more serious ways that could jeopardize lives.\n\nThe worst fears about robotaxis were realized in San Francisco last October when a vehicle operated by Cruise, a driverless ride-hailing service owned by General Motors, dragged a pedestrian who was hit by another car operated by a human for 20 feet (6 meters) while traveling at roughly 7 mph (11 kph) before coming to a stop. The incident resulted in California regulators suspending Cruise's state license and triggered a massive shakeup at that service.\n\nWaymo's robotaxis so far haven't been involved in any major accidents.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Harvard University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff said both President Joe Biden and his predecessor and challenger Donald Trump risk sending US debt levels into dangerous territory as Washington fails to grasp that the era of ultra-low interest rates won’t come back.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia US House Passes Bill That Would Force TikTok Sale or Ban It Ex-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary Tesla Gets Tagged With Once-Unthinkable Call: Sales Will Fall Physical Intelligence Is Building a Brain for Robots\n\n“Washington in general has a very relaxed attitude towards debt that I think they’re going to be sorry about,” Rogoff said on Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin. “It’s just not the free lunch that Congress and perhaps the two presidential candidates have gotten used to.”\n\nWhile an exact “upper limit” for the federal debt cannot be known — it’s estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to climb to 116% of US gross domestic product by 2034 from 99% today — Rogoff warned that there will be challenges as the level increases.\n\nThe former International Monetary Fund chief economist said the escalating borrowing load will create volatility in inflation and interest rates, and encourage political pressures on the Federal Reserve. Current CBO projections also leave “a lot of room for accidents” that drive debt even higher.\n\n“You’re taking bigger and bigger risks,” Rogoff said. “We will feel that.”\n\nBoth candidates may favor policies that will drive borrowing higher, he said. “Biden’s speech suggested blowing up the debt,” he said — even after the president in his State of the Union address last week proposed tax hikes to help to pay for spending priorities.\n\n“We have really no idea what Donald Trump will do, but that’s what he did last time he was president — good guess he will do it again,” Rogoff said, referring to widening fiscal deficits when Trump was president 2017-21.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the post-global financial crisis era, ultra-low interest rates helped to limit the impact of US deficits. But the post-pandemic period is different, Rogoff said. The real benchmark interest rate is more likely to be 1.5% to 2% rather than 0%, he said. Fed policymakers’ most recent projections imply a real, or inflation-adjusted, policy rate of 0.5%.\n\nThe Harvard economist also said that Trump and Biden are “certainly the two most protectionist presidents in a long time.” Trump levied tariff hikes on China as well as US allies during his term. Biden has maintained the higher tariffs on China, and Rogoff characterized his clean-energy legislation as highly protectionist in its preference for US-made products.\n\nRogoff differed from Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman in his analysis of Trump’s suggested 10% universal tariff on US imports. Krugman said last month that it would impose limited damage on the economy.\n\nRead more: Krugman Plays Down US Economic Harm From Trump’s Tariff Plan\n\n“It’s one thing to talk about over a 50-year horizon,” where the impact would be limited, Rogoff said. A sudden imposition is “very dislocating to the economy. I think it would tend to be very recessionary, inflationary.” Introducing “10% tariffs would I think push up inflation, they push up interest rates,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

The platform has been in public preview since November 2023.\n\n“Copilot is informed by large-scale data and threat intelligence, including more than 78 trillion security signals processed by Microsoft each day, and coupled with large language models to deliver tailored insights and guide next steps,” Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft corporate vice president of security, said in a statement.\n\nCopilot for Security is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, as well as Microsoft’s own AI models, and integrates into Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR.\n\nMicrosoft’s Sentinel is a platform that allows cybersecurity professionals to detect and hunt for threats, while Microsoft Defender helps them protect against, and address, attacks. Microsoft Security Copilot provides a means for cybersecurity workers to ask questions about threats and attacks and get responses based on whether and where potential attacks can or have hit an enterprise’s systems. Microsoft and its OEM partners are adding a new Copilot button to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards as the AI PC generation kicks off. (Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nIn addition to making Copilot for Security available for general purchase, Microsoft said it is adding new features to the platform including the ability for users to create their own generative AI prompts for their businesses and add third-party software integrations, as well as support for prompts and responses in eight languages.\n\nTo bolster its pitch for Copilot for Security, Microsoft is also releasing a new study that it says shows cybersecurity professionals not only benefit from Copilot, but want to continue using it.\n\nThe study, which Microsoft says focused on experienced security professionals, found that workers were 22% faster with Copilot and 7% more accurate across all tasks while using the software. Microsoft says 97% of those surveyed said they want to use Copilot the next time they do the same task.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilots, generative AI-powered apps, are currently available in preview or for general access across a slew of Microsoft’s software segments including finance, customer relationship management, cloud computing, productivity, Windows 11, and more.\n\nThe general idea is for Microsoft to integrate Copilots, or at least generative AI, into each of its products as it seeks to squeeze the most out of its multiyear, multibillion-dollar investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMicrosoft got off to an early lead in the generative AI wars thanks to its work with OpenAI, but the competition is catching up. In February, Alphabet’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.\n\nAnd last week, Salesforce (CRM) announced two new healthcare programs running on its AI-powered Einstein 1 Platform.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is also offering its own generative AI capabilities, setting up yet another front in the cloud wars between the two tech behemoths.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its healthcare offerings on the back of growing generative AI capabilities, which are presently acting as key growth catalysts for the company. Its shares have surged 47.4% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.2%.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google launched Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, a generative AI powered tool intended for the healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nThe tool utilizes generative AI to assist clinicians in searching for information from patient notes, scanned documents and other clinical data.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock",
        "content": "Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:  Top 5 Energy Stocks You May Want To Dump In March\n\nPhoto: ABCDstock/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $286.48 billion and $318.3 billion estimates indicate +11.7% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$154 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$129. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$139 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Alphabet?\n\nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $211.45, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Alphabet’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Alphabet generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "content": "Google has started the rollout of restrictions on what kind of election-related questions its AI chatbot Gemini will answer as it tries to prevent the spread of fake news during a year when billions of people will vote worldwide.\n\nThe technology giant said that users in India will be restricted as to what they can ask Gemini, or at least what types of questions it will provide responses to.\n\nIt is part of the company’s efforts to ensure that misinformation and disinformation is limited in a year when according to the Centre for American Progress more than two billion people in 50 countries will head to the polls.\n\nSome of these elections will be contested freely and fairly, while others will not.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe countries where votes are being held this year include the US, Mexico, Russia and probably the UK as well.\n\nBut by far the biggest is India, where around 900 million people are registered to vote according to Chatham House.\n\n“With millions of eligible voters in India heading to the polls for the general election in the coming months, Google is committed to supporting the election process by surfacing high-quality information to voters, safeguarding our platforms from abuse and helping people navigate AI-generated content,” Google said in a blog post.\n\nThe tech giant laid out a series of non-AI measures it was taking to try to reduce the harm for which its platforms might be used to spread.\n\nThese include efforts to provide information directly from the Electoral Commission of India on Google Search and YouTube.\n\nBut it will also include restrictions on how Gemini can be used.\n\n“Out of an abundance of caution on such an important topic, we have begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,” the Google India team said.\n\n“We take our responsibility for providing high-quality information for these types of queries seriously, and are continuously working to improve our protections.”",

        "title": "10 Biggest Stocks Targeted By Activist Investors Right Now",
        "content": "In this article, we're going to take a look at 10 biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now. You can skip ahead and take a look at more stocks that made our list by jumping straight to the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now.\n\nActivist investing seems to be on the rise, with the number of campaigns up by 7% in the year at 252, according to Lazard. Region-wise, a record-breaking number of campaigns was registered in Europe, 69, followed by 44 campaigns waged by activist investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nInterestingly enough, last year we saw some of the biggest companies being targeted by activist investors. Even tech behemoth Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was not spared, as billionaire Chris Hohn, the founder of TCI Fund Management, issued a letter in January 2023, requesting job cuts. In the letter, Hohn, whose fund holds a $6 billion position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said that the company needed to cut 20% of its workforce to bring back the employment levels to those in 2021.\n\nPaul Singer of Elliott Management\n\nMany other large-cap companies came on the radars of activist investors, with some companies targeted by several activists at once. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) saw a swarm of five activists surrounding it. More specifically, Dan Loeb's Third Point, Mason Morfit-led ValueAct Capital, Jeff Ubben's Inclusive Capital, Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and Jeffrey Smith's Starboard Value, approached Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) over the first half of 2023, as the company's stock was dwindling. Activists pushed Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)'s management for changes and they succeeded, as the stock recovered following some overhauls.\n\nOverall, activists seem to be more eager to go after larger companies. SquareWell Partners estimated that between January 2022 and June 2023, activist campaigns targeted 13 large-cap companies, which represents a substantial increase from four companies in the previous two years. This trend might persist this year as well, as our research of largest companies that have been targeted by activist investors in recent weeks already shows eight companies with a market cap above $10 billion, and the top 5 biggest stocks targeted by activists are companies with a market cap above $50 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nActivist investors are a very interesting group to follow when looking for stock picks. These investors usually take a position in companies and engage directly with their boards and management seeking changes to unlock shareholder value. This can involve anything from management changes and cost cuts to splitting the targeted company and the outright sale of the entire business.\n\nBut why is shareholder activism on the rise lately? Well, there are several reasons that can be highlighted. One is the cooldown of the global economy. Even though it seems the US economy might actually succeed to \"soft land\" as many experts predict, the economic growth still looks tepid and, other countries (see Germany) are heading towards a recession. In turn this means that companies are looking at slower revenue growth and more narrow bottom lines. According to FactSet, the blended annual earnings growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is 1.6%, which is significantly lower than the 5-year average growth of 9.5%. This is based on data from S&P 500 companies that either reported their actual results by February 2 (around 46% of the companies) and estimates for companies that were yet to report their results.\n\nIn this environment, it's understandable why activist investors are seeking for companies to take some actions to improve profitability. The aforementioned Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) became targets of activist investors who demanded exactly that. Chris Hohn requested Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to cut 20% of its workforce, but also said that the company needs to \"address excessive employee compensation,\" pointing out that the median salary in 2021 was $300,000. Regarding Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), one of the activists, Starboard Value, reportedly expressed displeasure at the company's expenses. Moreover, reports allege that many investors (potentially including activists) are disappointed about the integration of the workplace messaging app Slack, which was acquired in 2021 for nearly $28 billion, and might be questioning whether it needs to be sold.\n\nAnother reason behind the growth of shareholder activism is the ascend of the so-called ESG investing. ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, is a fairly new trend, where investors buy shares of the company not just because of the company's value, but also because the company scores high on the ESG metrics. According to a survey conducted by deVere Group, 56% of polled investors, plan to increase their ESG-focused holdings this year. Amid this trend, some activist investors have positioned themselves as ESG-focused. For example, Jeff Ubben has left ValueAct and launched Inclusive Fund, a firm focused entirely on sustainable businesses. As you will see later on in our breakdown of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors, some companies made our list because they got on the radars of ESG investors. Biggest Stocks Targeted By Activist Investors Right Now\n\nPaul Singer of Elliott Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the biggest stocks targeted by activist investors right now, we looked for companies that made the headlines in the context of renowned activist investors taking a position in the company in the recent weeks, or companies that were covered in the news in the context of recent activist campaign updates. We then ranked these companies based on their latest market capitalization.\n\n10. Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY)\n\nMarket Cap: $8.57 billion\n\nEtsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY)'s stock has been underperforming lately, dropping by 30% over the last year. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company's CEO Josh Silverman highlighted macroeconomic headwinds as impacting the company, but also adding that their belief is that this is a temporary situation.\n\n\"But this is a time when I think products that are not the cheapest possible are out of favor. And I don’t think that’s forever. When I imagine, going forward, does everyone always wants the cheapest version of any given product? No, absolutely not. I think that that trend, this is a cycle, we’re in a moment in the cycle, and I think we’ll move to better moments in the cycle, hopefully, soon,\" Silverman said.\n\nIn the meantime, Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) found itself in the cross-hairs of activist investor Paul Singer, whose fund Elliott Management owns 1.90 million shares as of the end of December. Not only did Elliott acquire a position in the company, but as of the beginning of February, the investor also obtained board representation. Marc Steinberg, an Elliott partner, upon joining the board, said in a press release that he believes that Etsy provides an opportunity for value creation and he will be working with the board and management to improve customer experience, accelerate growth and drive value over the long run.\n\nAt the end of December, there were 32 funds in our database bullish on Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY), unchanged over the quarter. Among these funds, the top shareholder is Brian Bares' Bares Capital Management, which holds 4.08 million shares.\n\n9. Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH)\n\nMarket Cap: $9.09 billion\n\nIn addition to adding Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) to its equity portfolio during the fourth quarter, Elliott Management also acquired a position in Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), a company that owns dating platform Tinder. In its latest 13F filing, Elliott reported holding 3.0 million shares of Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), although reports in January indicated that Elliott's stake could be as high as 9.5% of the company. However, Elliott has not yet announced any plans regarding its investment in the company.\n\nMatch Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s stock has been losing ground, having declined by 80% since 2021. For the fourth quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.08 and its revenue of $866.23 million, an increase of 10.19% on the year. During the earnings call, CEO Bernard Kim said that in 2024, Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH) plans to leverage AI to enhance the user experience for its Tinder platform.\n\n8. Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO)\n\nMarket Cap: $11.26 billion\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Dallas-based Anson Fund acquired a fairly small position in cloud communications company Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), having reported ownership of 440,540 shares plus Call options, in its latest 13F filing. Nevertheless, the fund took an activist stance towards the company and has already claimed a victory. In January, Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) CEO Jeff Lawson stepped down and resigned from the Board of Directors. Anson Funds, together with Legion Capital, which holds 601,050 shares, as of the end of December, have been pressuring company for over a year to divest assets in order to boost shareholder value, according to reports.\n\nTwilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO)'s stock slid by more than 80% over the last three years amid disappointing performance and currently represents one of the best beaten-down stocks to buy right now. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Khozema Shipchandler pointed out that its Twilio Segment business continued to underperform and the company had been conducting an operational review of the segment. When asked whether the conclusion of the review might result in a sale of the segment, Shipchandler said that they are approaching the review \"with an open mind.\"\n\nAt the end of December, there were 47 funds tracked by Insider Monkey bullish on Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), up by four funds over the quarter. Among these investors, David Blood And Al Gore's Generation Investment Management is the top shareholder with a stake comprising 8.50 million shares.\n\n7. Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB)\n\nMarket Cap: $15.50 billion\n\nNext in our list of biggest stocks targeted by activist investors is Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), a $15.5 billion a technology company that supports a number of industries, including construction, agriculture, natural resources, and utilities. In December, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) got in the cross-hairs of activist investor Barry Rosenstein, whose fund Jana Partners acquired a new position containing 3.76 million shares during the fourth quarter. When disclosing the position, Jana Partners said they would request the company to halt acquisitions and focus on organic growth and improving margins. In January, Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) announced a buyback worth $800 million and added two new board members.\n\nAt the end of December, there were 29 funds with long positions in Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB), up by three over the quarter. Besides Jana Partners, other funds bullish on the company include Generation Investment Management and Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group, which own 12.27 million shares and 6.24 million shares, respectively.\n\n6. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)\n\nMarket Cap: $21.52 billion\n\nIllumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILNM) saw 58 funds from our database holding its shares as of the end of December. One of these investors is Carl Icahn's Icahn Capital, which owns 430,000 shares, according to its latest 13F filing. Another activist investor that acquired shares of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is Keith Meister's Corvex Capital, which holds 730,084 shares. Icahn has been after Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) for awhile, but in December, the investor said it planned to oust the board. Previously, the activist had been criticizing the acquisition of cancer test maker Grail and in December Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) announced plans to divest Grail.\n\nNevertheless, in his open letter to shareholders, Icahn said:\n\n\"We have major misgivings that as long as this current board remains in power, even if there is a divestiture, it will come with far too many strings attached. Why should stockholders trust the legacy conflicted directors with the GRAIL divesture process? Our third goal is to remove these legacy conflicted directors.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Stocks Targeted By Activist Investors Right Now.   Suggested articles: Billionaire Paul Singer's Recent Activist Targets and Top Stock Picks10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 202416 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024",

        "title": "US House to vote to force ByteDance to divest TikTok or face ban",
        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app used by about 170 million Americans or face a ban.\n\nThe vote is expected around 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) under fast-track rules that require support by two-thirds of House members for the measure to pass. It is widely expected to pass, according to both proponents and opponents.\n\nThe vote comes just over a week since the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and after action in Congress had stalled for more than a year. Last month, President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among Tiktok officials that legislation was unlikely this year. The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee last week voted 50-0 in favor of the bill, setting it up for a vote before the full House.\n\nBut the bill faces a more uncertain path in the U.S. Senate where some senators favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps that could pose security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not indicated how he plans to proceed.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said.\n\n\"This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,\" the company said. \"The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression,\" it added.\n\nBiden said last week that he would sign the bill.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday the goal was ending Chinese ownership, not banning TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Do we want TikTok, as a platform, to be owned by an American company or owned by China? Do we want the data from TikTok - children's data, adults’ data - to be going, to be staying here in America or going to China?\" he said.\n\nIt is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikTok's U.S. assets could be divested in six months.\n\nIf ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple , Alphabet's Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.\n\nIn 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts. In recent days he had raised concerns about a ban. It remains unclear if Tencent's WeChat or other high-profile Chinese-owned apps could face a ban under the legislation.\n\nAny forced TikTok divestment from the U.S. would almost certainly face legal challenges, which the company would need to file within 165 days of the bill being signed by the president. In November, a U.S. judge blocked a Montana state ban on TikTok use after the company sued. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Jamie Freed)",

        "title": "10 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa",
        "content": "In this article, we will list the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence industry, go to 5 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical objects, devices, machines, and other products that are embedded with sensors, software, and communication technologies. These devices can collect, and more importantly, exchange data with each other and central systems over the internet. They gather information to make decisions and interact with the physical world and digital systems.\n\nThe IoT market is one of the fastest-growing ones globally. Growth is propelled by an increased demand for automation and an increasing need for big data for data management. Research and cloud computing platforms are also driving the growth of IoT. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also pushing the market's growth. Its market size, which was $328.6 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. The global IoT market will experience a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.46% during this forecast period. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at 33%.\n\nThe IoT market is segmented by components, deployment, organization size, platform, technology, and industry verticals. The software segment has the largest share when segmented according to component. The cloud segment leads in the deployment segmentation, whereas the enterprise segment has the largest share when segmented according to organization size. In addition, the network communication segment has the largest market share when segmented according to technology.\n\nIoT devices often rely on ML and AI to carry out their tasks. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Echo devices are an example of IoT devices that use AI to enhance their capabilities. These devices are smart speakers that come with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Recently, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has made many AI-related enhancements to Alexa to give it a more opinionated personality. These enhancements also give it the ability to adjust tone and response to express emotions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, generative AI like ChatGPT has gained the attention of tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others. The AI market is currently in the stage of maturation and has significant opportunities for real-world application. It has a positive long-term growth outlook, and these tech giants are looking to cash in on this opportunity.\n\nThe global AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% during the forecast period of 2022-2023. It was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $2,575 billion by 2032. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at more than 36%. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to expand the highest during this forecast period with a CAGR of 20.3%.\n\nThe AI market can be segmented according to technology, solution, and end user. Technology-wise, deep learning has the largest share. The services segment takes the lead when segmented according to the solution. When segmented according to end users, banking, financial services & insurance (BSFI) takes the lead.\n\nAI's flexibility and adaptability are driving its growth. Some of the areas where it is being increasingly used are life-saving medical devices and self-driving features in electric cars. This growth is also propelled by an increasing investment from top tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) for the upgradation and development of various applications of AI. One of the supplier-side factors driving the growth of AI is the vendor and end-user industries' partnership to enhance reach. An example of such a partnership is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Intelligent Network's collaboration with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also causing disruption left and right. A startup founded by an ex-Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa scientist is looking to disrupt the investment industry through AI. Theia Insights recently raised $6.5 million. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of financial information through AI and other tech so investors can make better decisions.\n\nMachine learning and deep learning-based healthcare detection systems are also emerging trends in the industry. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s machine learning technology advances the early detection of diabetic eye disease using deep learning. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s diabetic eye disease detection technology is found to be 86% accurate in classifying the severity of the disease across the five levels recognized on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.\n\nOne of the ongoing trends in AI is experimentation in advertising. AI giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Co-pilot, open AI's Chat GPT, and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Gemini are experimenting with ads so they could solve the monetization issue of generative AI. Most people are not willing to spend $20 every month for premium generative AI models such as GPT-4. So, ads could soon take over chatbots, which would provide these companies with a more viable revenue model. This is already been done by Adzedek which introduces itself as an AI chatbot advertising market palace. The company lets brands run sponsored ads in its custom chatbots, the revenue of which is shared between Adzedek and the chatbot creator.\n\nThere is severe competition within the AI industry which also comes from new entrants. A Palo Alto-based startup by the name of Inflection AI has developed a generative chatbot that is considered as powerful as the GPT-4 model, especially across STEM subjects. This Inflection AI model is currently powering Pi, Inflection AI's voice assistant. Many people consider Pi to be ChatGPT that can take commands in the form of voice inputs.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.  10 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\nPhoto by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa, we used five (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the speaker appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of speakers in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 10/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the speaker ranks on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans",
        "content": "For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple, Alphabet and Tesla\n\nThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.\n\nApple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.\n\nThis seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.\n\nAs AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.\n\nAdditionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.\n\nAlphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.\n\nOr course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.\n\nWhile major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.\n\nUntil this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Google is restricting AI chatbot Gemini from answering questions about the global elections set to happen this year, the Alphabet-owned firm said on Tuesday, as it looks to avoid potential missteps in the deployment of the technology.\n\nThe update comes at a time when advancements in generative AI, including image and video generation, have fanned concerns of misinformation and fake news among the public, prompting governments to regulate the technology.\n\nWhen asked about elections such as the upcoming U.S. presidential match-up between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Gemini responds with \"I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search\".\n\nGoogle had announced restrictions within the U.S. in December, saying they would come into effect ahead of the election.\n\n\"In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we are restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,\" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.\n\nAside from the United States, national elections are set to be held in several large countries including South Africa and India, the world's largest democracy.\n\nIndia has asked tech firms to seek government approval before the public release of AI tools that are \"unreliable\" or under trial, and to label them for the potential to return wrong answers.\n\nGoogle's AI products are under the scanner after inaccuracies in some historical depictions of people created by Gemini forced it to pause the chatbot's image-generation feature late last month.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai had said the company was working to fix those issues and called the chatbot's responses \"biased\" and \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nFacebook-parent Meta Platforms said last month it will set up a team to tackle disinformation and the abuse of generative AI in the run-up to European Parliament elections in June.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "title": "LCF fraud victims demand £20m from Google",
        "content": "google\n\nVictims of the London Capital & Finance (LCF) scandal have demanded Google pay back tens of millions of pounds that was spent on misleading digital advertising to promote the alleged “Ponzi scheme”.\n\nThe High Court heard last week that a marketing agency working on behalf of LCF paid Google more than £20m to promote its financial products.\n\nMany of the 11,500 people who put money into LCF did so after discovering it through Google. LCF, which sold “mini-bonds” to investors, raised more than £237m before it collapsed in 2019.\n\nThe company’s administrators are now suing seven individuals associated with the failed business, and two corporate defendants, for fraud. Lawyers acting for the administrators have accused the collapsed firm of “operating as a Ponzi scheme”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs well as spending investors money on adverts to find more backers, the defendants allegedly spent money on private members clubs, including the exclusive Annabel’s club in London, Rolex watches, shotguns and sports cars, the court has heard.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has accused LCF of enticing vulnerable savers into “investing in unsuitable, high-risk products”. Michael Thomson, LCF’s former chief executive, was sentenced to 10-months in prison – suspended for two years – for contempt amid an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Former LCF chief executive Michael Thomson was given a suspended prison sentence for contempt\n\nStephen Robins KC, for the claimants, told the High Court last week that a marketing business – the defendant Surge Financial – created promotions for LCF and paid millions of pounds to Google for advertising. Surge earned commission when savers bought LCF’s products.\n\nThe Brighton-based marketing business, which was founded by defendant Paul Careless, allegedly created phoney comparison websites that encouraged savers to invest in LCF’s products. Multiple of these seemingly independent sites would appear in Google searches for key terms to attract investments.\n\nLCF’s high risk mini-bonds were marketed next to seemingly safe products but carried much higher interest rates that would entice consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr Robins told the High Court that Mr Careless had emailed colleagues to state “we spent over £20m with Google”, which with VAT would amount to £24m. Another internal email put the estimate at £16.3m.\n\nTranscripts from the case were published by the open justice blog Mouse In The Court.\n\nIn the claimant’s initial submissions, Mr Robins stated Surge’s “largest expense was the cost of advertising on Google”. Mr Robins said the ultimate amount spent was a “shifting figure” and the claimants did not yet have a “definitive answer” of how much Google made.\n\nAndrea Hall, a spokesman for the LCF Bondholders Action Group, said victims of the scandal “felt ignored and let down by Google”. She said victims “expect the millions to be repaid”.\n\nMs Hall claimed that “Google provided the mechanism” for the alleged fraud and, as such, victims “should expect to see [the money] repaid.”\n\nShe said: “Google allowed its search and ad networks to become a rat’s nest of fake comparison sites designed to confuse and or trick consumers.”\n\nGoogle is not a party to the lawsuit. However, the company has long been criticised for not doing enough to vet financial advertisers on its search engine, with LCF held up as a key failure.\n\nIn 2020, Google began requiring advertisers to verify their identity and in 2021, it tightened its financial advertising rules to ensure companies promoting certain products verify they are regulated by the FCA.\n\nA spokesman said: “Protecting people when they are searching for financial products and services is a top priority.” They added that Google had “strict rules” about promoting financial products. The search engine removed 198m adverts that violated its financial services rules in 2022.\n\nThe defendants deny wrongdoing. Both Mr Thomson and Mr Careless’s lawyers say their clients deny “each and every claim against” them and argue that LCF “carried on a legitimate business”. Mr Careless declined to comment.\n\nIn a legal filing, he denied all the claims against him and said the payments received by Surge were “lawful”.\n\nThe case continues.",

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Alphabet (GOOGL) standing at $137.67, reflecting a +1.67% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.11% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.41%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the internet search leader had lost 9.12% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.42% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.7% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Alphabet to post earnings of $1.49 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.58% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.77 per share and revenue of $286.48 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.16% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, Alphabet boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Alphabet's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.99. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 29.07 for its industry.\n\nWe can also see that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.25.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 152, this industry ranks in the bottom 40% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 5 Stocks.\n\nOn March 8 Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC said that the latest pullback in AI stocks shows how “fickle” the stock market can be. Cramer said while he is a big “believer” in AI, some stocks in the industry became too hot. While Jim Cramer keeps recommending investors to take some money off the table when stocks run too high, he’s still highly bullish on mega-cap tech stocks and AI plays like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). For example, last week, Jim Cramer advised a caller during his program to “stick” with Meta Platforms. Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”\n\nJim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.\n\nJim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Does Not Like These Stocks in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. With each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment to see what smart money investors think about these stocks.  Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about New York-based REIT Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL). Cramer said it’s one of those commercial real estate companies where he does not know “what they own.” Cramer said he “never recommend these stocks.” Cramer also claimed that he has been right from “day one” about these stocks that’s why he won’t recommend this one.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL).\n\n9. Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer seems extremely disappointed with restaurant chain company Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO). When asked about the stock during his latest program on CNBC, Cramer said he has “lost faith” in Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) management. Cramer said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) insiders were selling the stock all along. He also thinks Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) is an overvalued company. He said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) needs better earnings.\n\nLast month Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) announced Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.07. Revenue in the period jumped 24.5% year over year to $187.9 million, surpassing estimates by $3.68 million.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on PTLO, he's recommending buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n8. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nJim Cramer yet again reiterated his thesis on crypto-related stocks when he was recently asked about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer said it’s better to buy Bitcoin if you want exposure to cryptocurrencies. Cramer said buying Bitcoin or the “Ethereum ETF that’s gonna be coming” would be better than buying Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer was referring to the spot Ethereum ETF that is expected to be approved by the SEC in the coming days.\n\n7. Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nRoku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. When a Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) investor recently asked Cramer about the stock, Cramer said “you are in a house of pain” and he thinks the “door” won’t open anytime soon if someone is looking to sell the stock without bearing losses.\n\nCramer said he does not want to “be there” on Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) since he believes the “forces of improvement are weighing on” Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). Cramer said the Walmart deal was a “kiss of death” for Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). He was referring to Walmart’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Vizio which is expected to increase the already hot competition in the streaming industry.\n\n6. Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWhen asked about Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) in a recent program, Jim Cramer said he would start talking “positively” about robotic process automation stocks if they start making money. But until then, Cramer said, he cannot recommend companies that are not making money. In November last year Cramer had advised investors to not “touch” Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH).\n\nWhile Jim Cramer is bearish on UiPath, he's bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nIn February, Scotia Bank started covering Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) stock with a $29 price target. Scotia Bank’s analysts wrote:\n\n\"We believe PATH is set up to make further inroads into automation budgets and continue its industry leadership, but the opportunities come with challenges, namely a dynamic end-market and rising competition. We are intrigued by PATH’s growth durability and margin progression as it scaled to $1.5B in ARR in short order, but wait for a better entry point before recommending shares.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 38 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH). The most notable stakeholder of Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) during this period was Cathie Wood, which had a $1 billion stake in the company.\n\nPart of the reason why Cathie Wood likes Uipath is AI. The company talked about its AI offerings and future plans in an earnings call in December 2023: [Read the entire earnings call transcript here]\n\n\"We expect Autopilot, which is based on Generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, Document Understanding, and Specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade end-to-end processes automation. Autopilot for Studio is intended to help developers across skill levels build automations faster by leveraging natural language descriptions to generate automation workflows.

Document Understanding is driving significant value for customers including a Chicago based public utility. Working with Deloitte, they have created a robust automation program across their organization leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their meter inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date.\n\nWith c-level sponsorship, during the quarter they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey with a goal of saving over $70 million a year. And, we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing or IDP, 2023-2024 Vendor Assessment where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform. Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market leading capabilities with a customer first mindset.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Appear Poised to Become Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Since this year began, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite have powered to record-closing highs. While there have been patches of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have done the bulk of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent some of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap (as of the closing bell on March 5, 2024), the Magnificent Seven are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are industry-leading businesses with impressive moats\n\nWhat makes the Magnificent Seven so special is their sustained competitive advantages.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure is the world's rapidly growing No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services, while Windows remains the global leader among desktop operating systems. Apple has been a pioneer in smartphone innovation for more than a decade, and offers a share repurchase program that no other publicly traded company can match. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate in AI-accelerated data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global No. 1 cloud infrastructure service platform. Alphabet's Google had a monopoly like 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure. Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.\n\nForget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 stock split. Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split. Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split. Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nGiven that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.\n\nFor example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.\n\nWhat's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.\n\nAdd in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.\n\nInstead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.\n\nAlthough Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.\n\nThe company's social media \"real estate\" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.\n\nWhat all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.\n\nAnd unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.\n\nMicrosoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.\n\nIn terms of \"high-growth initiatives,\" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.\n\nMicrosoft's AI ambitions are also on display. It's invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, incorporated AI solutions into search engine Bing, and plans to lean on various generative AI solutions to assist businesses with document processing and conversational AI on the Azure platform.\n\nLastly, Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies that sports the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft's legacy operations and cloud services wouldn't miss a beat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Third \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.\n\nAlphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.\n\nWatching where a stock has been\n\nThe 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.\n\nFor example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign. NVDA Chart\n\nThe 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock. GOOGL Chart\n\nNotice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.\n\nIn the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.\n\nUnderstanding market sentiment\n\nA great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.\n\nIf you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.\n\nAnother recent example is Target(NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.\n\nIn sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.\n\nUsing moving averages to your advantage\n\nThe best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.\n\nIn other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.\n\nIt happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.\n\nThe point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.\n\nWhat the Alphabet sell-off tells us\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.\n\nApple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.\n\nThe market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).\n\nThe market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.\n\nAlphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats story moved on Friday without change to text)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best AI Stock to Buy and Hold",
        "content": "It would take time to find a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has recently. Thanks to heightened interest (or more like a craze) in companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI), this stock has soared 271% in the last 12 months and a whopping 2,170% just in the past five years.\n\nFor those who have watched from the sidelines, it's understandable if you think it's too late to get in on the action. After all, Nvidia is currently a $2.2 trillion enterprise.\n\nBut don't be discouraged. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), an innovative business at the leading edge of the internet for more than two decades, might just be the best AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nA meteoric rise to the top\n\nNvidia sells chips that power data centers which support AI functions, and it counts some big tech corporations as its customers. It's OK if the latest financials have you picking up your jaw from the floor. Nvidia reported revenue growth of 126% in 2023. Even more impressive, operating income surged 686%.\n\nThis company is looking at a truly massive opportunity. On a global basis, the AI market is forecast to rise 800% by the end of the decade. Based on its financial results thus far, it's hard to deny that Nvidia is in a powerful position to benefit from this tech trend.\n\nNvidia's monster rise in the last few years has now made it the world's third-most valuable business. And the shares, unsurprisingly, look expensive. They trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74. That's a lofty valuation, even when you factor in Nvidia's growth prospects.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to want to ride this momentum to strong portfolio returns, the enthusiasm surrounding the company these days might leave zero margin of safety for prospective investors. There's another compelling opportunity to take advantage of today.\n\nDon't forget about Alphabet\n\nNvidia deserves credit, that's for sure. But don't sleep on Alphabet. The FAANG stock has dropped 14% since hitting a new all-time high in late January. This means investors can scoop up shares at a compelling P/E multiple of about 23. That seems like a no-brainer decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's best not to forget that this business is one of the early pioneers of AI, introducing the technology in Google Search in 2001. Back then, AI helped users improve their spelling when making search queries.\n\nAlphabet's progress has been notable. In late 2016, CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed that the company would be \"AI-first.\" This was six years before the famous launch of ChatGPT, which started the AI craze currently underway.\n\n\"In the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available -- be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go -- and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive, and above all, more intelligent,\" Pichai wrote in a blog post more than seven years ago.\n\nThe fact that consumers probably don't realize that Alphabet has already integrated AI into its various products and services is indicative of how the business has seamlessly executed its strategy. Whether it's Gmail, Photos, Maps, or YouTube, AI permeates through.\n\nAnd when it comes to Google Cloud, which is a back-end infrastructure provider to enterprise and government clients, Alphabet has ample opportunity to move the needle forward with AI. There are already numerous features available to customers, be it generative AI, machine learning, language, or other areas.\n\nIn the last 24 months, Alphabet generated $203 billion of operating cash flow. And as of Dec. 31, the company had nearly $100 billion of net cash on the books. This puts Alphabet in a league of its own when it comes to having the financial resources to continue investing aggressively in AI capabilities. It will be hard for others to keep up.\n\nNvidia is getting all the attention these days. But investors need to consider Alphabet as a smart buying opportunity right now. It's in a favorable position to benefit over the long term from the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos’s investment in Perplexity AI has nearly doubled in value in a few months as Google challenger nears $1B unicorn status",
        "content": "Given the long list of companies that have tried and failed, challenging Google seems to be a losing proposition. Yet Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently placed a bet on Perplexity AI, a startup that, despite the daunting odds, is taking on the search giant.\n\n“Startups are all about being bold,” Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas recently toldFortune. “Are you building a company that has unbounded potential? That’s risky, but there’s an infinite reward if it works.”\n\nFounded in August 2022, Perplexity aims to challenge Google by offering an AI-based search engine that is “part chatbot and part search engine, offering real-time information and footnotes showing the sources of its answers,” as its website states.\n\nIn January, Srinivas shared in a blog post that Perplexity had grown to 10 million monthly active users and had served over half a billion queries in 2023. He also revealed that the company had raised $73.6 million from venture capitalists, companies including Nvidia, and various angel investors—as well as Jeff Bezos, through his Bezos Expeditions Fund.\n\nThe funding round valued Perplexity at about $520 million. Now, just a few months later, the venture is finalizing a new funding deal at a valuation of around $1 billion, according to a report this week by the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.\n\nIf accurate, that means Bezos’s investment has nearly doubled in the space of a few months. No doubt the ability of Perplexity to quickly reach 10 million monthly active users impressed him, just as, nearly three decades ago, the “startling statistic” of the web growing at 2,300% a year inspired him to start Amazon.\n\nHe wasn’t the only investor to take notice of the startup's rapid growth. Perplexity is “one of the few consumer AI products to reach this major milestone of 10 million MAUs,” said Jonathan Cohen, VP of applied research at Nvidia, in the January funding announcement. Artificial intelligence, he added, will “transform how we access information.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Srinivas certainly believes so, and he’s taken numerous digs at Google search, which he believes has grown tiresome.\n\n\"Google is going to be viewed as something that's legacy and old, and Perplexity will be viewed as something that's the next generation and future,\" he told Reuters in January.\n\nOf course, Google isn’t sitting still. Indeed, it’s been testing AI-powered search on millions of users.\n\nSrinivas recently toldFortune, however, that Google \"has no incentive to actually move fast and nail this product experience because their core money is coming from making people click on links and view links.”\n\nPerplexity makes money by offering a Pro version for $20 per month that allows users to pick from various large language models, among them OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 2.1, or the venture’s own LLM Perplexity.\n\n“Our value proposition is that the free product is already so good that you can still use it without having to pay for it, but the paid product is going to be insane,” Srinivas told Fortune.\n\nHe's also counting on people increasingly turning to AI chatbots instead of Google as they look for things online.\n\n“The times of sifting through SEO spam, sponsored links, and multiple web pages will be replaced by a much more efficient way to consume and share information,” he wrote in the January announcement. And as told the Wall Street Journal around the same time, “If you can directly answer somebody’s question, nobody needs those 10 blue links.”\n\nOf course, even Perplexity does hit a $1 billion valuation, it has a long way to go to truly challenge Google, which has enormous resources and AI talent at its disposal—and whose parent Alphabet is valued at $1.7 trillion.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "The AI arms race between the US and China is heating up",
        "content": "Tech billionaires aren’t the only ones fighting for control of AI. The US and China are too.\n\nThe two world superpowers are competing with each other for everything from the intellectual know-how to design AI hardware and software to the raw materials that power artificial intelligence systems. Both are also using government subsidies to spur new advancements.\n\nWhere the US holds a commanding lead at the moment is the development of generative AI systems such as large language models (LLMs), according to Frank Long with Goldman Sachs' (GS) office of applied innovation. These models hoover up existing data and use it as the basis for chatbots like Open AI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnother advantage for the US is that it can place export restrictions on high-performance semiconductors designed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA) that are in intense demand across the AI world. That, for now, is keeping development of the most sophisticated LLMs out of China’s reach, Long said. Nvidia is now one of the world's most valuable companies due to soaring demand for AI computing power. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nChina, however, is countering with its own maneuvers. It is restricting the export of chipmaking metals gallium and germanium to the US while also reportedly amassing a new $27 billion chip fund to back its own major projects.\n\nThe fierce competition for AI talent between the two countries turned up a notch this past week when the US Justice Department unsealed an indictment charging a Chinese national and former Google (GOOG, GOOGL) AI software developer with stealing 500 files of confidential code that the tech giant uses for its supercomputing data centers to train LLMs.\n\nThe government alleged that after stealing the intellectual property the defendant began simultaneously working for rival companies in China.\n\nThe charges “are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People’s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.\n\n'Horse race'\n\nThe fight for global supremacy of AI was a hot topic of discussion earlier this month at the Web Summit’s annual technology conference in Doha, Qatar, an event that attracted investors and tech executives from around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI leaders from the public and private sectors acknowledged that the US and China currently have the edge. The countries currently rank No. 1 and No. 2 in Tortoise Media'sGlobal AI Index, which measures nations based on AI investment, innovation, and implementation.\n\nBut the leaders also said at the summit that it's too soon to know which countries over time will leverage the technology to the greatest economic and societal advantage. Singapore, for example, is now No. 3 in Tortoise's index after moving up rapidly in recent years. Singapore is climbing the ranks of AI powers.

Taiwan is home to a cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which produces 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors and 68% of semiconductors worldwide. Engineers work in a cleanroom at the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute in Hsinchu, Taiwan. (Ann Wang/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJapan and South Korea are also home to leading semiconductor manufacturing and design firms, and they are setting aside more government funds to drive AI advancement.\n\nJapan allocated $13 billion to the technology in its 2023 budget, up from $8.6 billion in 2022, while South Korea committed $470 billion over the next 23 years to create the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nOther potential AI hubs could emerge in Europe and the Middle East. The Netherlands — home to ASML (ASML) — is already the world’s sole manufacturer of ultraviolet lithography machines, required to fabricate leading-edge semiconductors.

(EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nThe UAE has a $10 billion fund to invest in late-state technologies, while Israel has also attracted billions in private AI investments.\n\nGlobal power will shift towards nations that produce versus solely consume AI technology, according to Alaa Abdulaal, head of digital foresight for the Riyadh-based multilateral foundation Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO). The group's mission is to recommend government policies that promote access to technology.\n\n\"It cannot be only done by government itself,\" Abdulaal said. \"It needs to take a cooperative approach, where we have at the same table the private sector, public sector, civil society — all of them sitting together to come up with the right set of frameworks for AI.\"\n\n'Getting much closer'\n\nToday, most countries have adopted, at minimum, a national strategy to develop and protect against the potential risks of AI. And some have cleared the way for regulations, though none have been tested against market forces.\n\nIn March, the EU is expected to adopt new legal restraints around AI. Earlier this year the bloc's member states signaled their agreement with the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate the technology.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US or UK, and it’s unknown whether that will happen.\n\nIn October, President Biden issued an executive order to encourage safe AI development, including privacy protections. More than a dozen US states have adopted multiple AI-related laws. President Joe Biden speaks about government regulations on artificial intelligence systems during an event in the East Room of the White House last year. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe UK, for its part, rolled out a “National AI Strategy” in 2022 and committed roughly $4 billion in chip development subsidies. The nation has also attracted the third-largest level of private investment in AI, behind the US and China.\n\nState subsidies and export bans may not hold sway forever as nations compete, said Jihad Tayara, CEO of Evoteq, a Dubai-based company that facilitates public-private collaborations to build AI into public infrastructure.\n\n\"It's getting much closer,\" Tayara said of the digital divide, noting that most nations have access to high-speed 5G data capabilities.\n\nAnd human capital, along with access to open-source models, will matter too.\n\n\"Today we're seeing open-source models emerging that are in many use cases equivalent in capability to the absolute most frontier models,\" Long said.\n\nNations that prepare their workforces to develop and implement AI models will gain a considerable edge, Abdulaal said.\n\n\"This opportunity cannot be seen unless we have the right people in place.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Bubble Angst Belied by Big-Tech Weaklings, Broader S&amp;P 500 Gains",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US stocks’ torrid climb to start 2024 is evoking worrisome comparisons with past boom-and-bust cycles on Wall Street, sparking debate over the risk that the market is overheating.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats Billions Pour Into Nigeria as Tinubu’s Reforms Start to Pay Off Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin? Slow US Inflation Retreat Is Set to Bolster Fed Patience on Rate Cuts The $1 Trillion Race to Rebuild Ukraine Is Slowly Getting Going\n\nThere’s ample reason to wonder whether shares have advanced at an unsustainable pace: The S&P 500 Index has closed at record highs 16 times this year, accounting for about a third of all trading days; AI darling Nvidia Corp. has soared nearly 80%, adding roughly $1 trillion in market value, even after sliding Friday along with other tech shares; and speculative areas like Bitcoin have surged.\n\nYet there are signs that the strength, based in large part on the economy’s resilience and robust corporate earnings, hasn’t turned into a speculative frenzy.\n\nSeveral of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks have sputtered, showing that investors aren’t throwing money at the market with abandon. The muted reaction to initial public offerings of late also backs up that notion. What’s more, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 just hit a historic high, indicating the rally is broadening out. And valuations of the benchmark’s biggest stocks are well below levels seen for the market leaders at the height of previous market cycles.\n\nScott Chronert at Citigroup Inc. also notes that the seven megacap tech firms contribute roughly 20% to S&P 500 earnings, which he says largely justifies their market-capitalization weighting of about a third of the gauge.\n\n“There was a premise where you were trying to build out Internet infrastructure back then, much like right now we’re building out AI,” Chronert said. “But the nature of the companies’ revenue and the cash flows that are supporting it are markedly different.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBelow are some charts that may dispel concerns of a bubble forming:\n\nMegacap Divide\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies — Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia and Tesla Inc. — moved in unison through much of last year, driving the brunt of the market’s gains and reigning until very recently as the S&P 500’s biggest firms.\n\nThe relentless demand for the group’s shares drew parallels to the speculative frenzy surrounding Internet stocks at the turn of the century.\n\nBut the seven have diverged in 2024 as investors soured on the outlook for several firms, signaling that the froth around the cohort may have diminished.\n\nApple has dropped this year, in part amid concern over iPhone sales in China. The firm closed at a record in December before retreating. With demand for its vehicles waning, Tesla has fared even worse, dropping below Eli Lilly & Co. in terms of market value. Google parent Alphabet has also declined this year.\n\nMore Participants\n\nCountering worries that a handful of shares were powering the bull run, the gains are showing signs of extending beyond just technology.\n\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weight Index set a closing record last week for the first time in two years. The gauge gives an equal share to each constituent, rather than weighting by market capitalization.\n\nThe share of S&P 500 stocks at all-time highs in the past month has risen, reaching the highest since early 2022, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Gillian Wolff show.\n\nEven so, less than a third of stocks are at records, “leaving plenty of room” for the bull market to gather participants, they said in a note.\n\nIn contrast, by the time the tech bubble was about to burst in early 2000, the ratio of stocks at historic levels was waning, from around 60% at one point in 1997 to 20% at the turn of the century, the strategists wrote.\n\nIPO Blues\n\nInvestors’ limited appetite for new listings is another indicator that sentiment is short of the kind of euphoria typically seen around bubbles.\n\nIn 1999, about 42% of US IPOs that raised more than $100 million saw share prices pop 50% or more through the close of the first day of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In 2024, only one — CG Oncology Inc. — has met that criteria.\n\nThe US IPO market raised about $89 billion in 1999. While the market saw record business in 2021, it’s hit a wall since. There have been 36 IPOs in the US this year, raising $7.2 billion. In 2021, companies generated roughly $300 billion from around 1,000 deals.\n\nValuations Compared\n\nRobust profits from some of the tech behemoths have also brought down sky-high valuations. They remain relatively stretched, but they’re still well below prior peaks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks, for example, trade near their average price-to-earnings ratio since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nAnd take the largest five S&P 500 stocks today. They trade at less than half the multiples of the top stocks in early 2000 — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell — a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis shows.\n\nValuations are also contained across tech shares in areas including AI and robotics, with most of those baskets at or below their five-year average for price-to-sales multiples, according to BI.\n\n--With assistance from Elena Popina, Jessica Menton and Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Better AI Stock: AMD vs. Alphabet",
        "content": "Despite more than a year of seemingly nonstop coverage on the artificial intelligence (AI) market, Wall Street just can't get enough. The industry remains a high-growth area, with plenty of investment opportunities.\n\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That rate would see the segment achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by decade's end.\n\nSo despite the industry's meteoric rise over the last year, it seems to have barely scratched the surface of its potential. As a result, it's not too late to dedicate a portion of your holdings to AI and benefit from its growth for years.\n\nTwo exciting options are Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), with one expanding in the hardware side of the industry and the other investing in its AI software offerings.\n\nLet's examine these businesses more closely and determine whether you're better off investing in the budding AI market through AMD's or Alphabet's stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nShares in AMD have climbed 43% year to date. The company rallied investors by pivoting its business to AI as it seeks to claim a slice of the lucrative market.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia stole much of the spotlight, as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while AMD was left playing catch-up. However, AMD shifted its focus over the last year and could make a big splash in the industry in 2024.\n\nLast December, the company unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in AI. However, its financials are moving in a positive direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's AI-focused data center segment posted revenue growth of 38%. Meanwhile, improvements in the PC market boosted AMD's client segment by 65% year over year.\n\nIn addition to AI chips, AMD is diversifying its role in the market by expanding in AI PCs as it seeks to dominate its own area of the industry.\n\nAlphabet\n\nIt's impossible to deny Alphabet's top spot in tech, with brands like Android, YouTube, and Google attracting billions of users worldwide. The popularity of these offerings has seen Alphabet snap up a leading 25% market share in the digital advertising market.\n\nHowever, over the last year, all eyes have been on the tech giant's expanding AI efforts. Toward the end of 2023, the company impressed by debuting Gemini, a large language model that looked likely to make Alphabet competitive against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nYet the Google company's stock is down 7% in the last month after a disappointing launch for Gemini. Alphabet held a presentation for the new AI model recently, and Gemini gave inaccurate depictions of historical figures and failed to recognize key differences between other prominent figures. The blunders forced Alphabet to take its AI image services offline for now.\n\nIn spite of recent headwinds, Alphabet hit nearly $70 billion in free cash flow last year. The company has a mountain to climb to get its AI tech on track and keep up with competitors, but Alphabet is financially secure and has the funds to keep investing in its business.\n\nIs AMD or Alphabet the better AI stock?\n\nDespite having a slower start than their respective rivals in AI, AMD and Alphabet have promising prospects in the industry over the long term. However, for now, Alphabet's recent software fumbles make AMD's chip business feel more secure.\n\nMeanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) estimates suggest AMD might have more room to run over the next two years. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe chart shows AMD's earnings could reach just over $7 per share in the next two fiscal years, while Alphabet's may hit nearly $9 per share. On the surface, Alphabet looks like the clear winner.\n\nHowever, multiplying these figures by the companies' recent forward price-to-earnings ratios (AMD's 58 and Alphabet's 20) yields projected stock prices of $418 for AMD and $176 for Alphabet. Based on their current positions, these projections would see AMD's stock rise 98% and Alphabet's 30% by fiscal 2026.\n\nAlongside a more reliable role in AI, AMD's stock is a screaming buy over Alphabet this month.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Most Likely to Deliver a 5X Gain by 2030: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You won't have to look hard to find well-known stocks that have been multi-baggers in recent years. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) share price has more than quadrupled since 2014. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up more than 9x during the same period. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered a gain of over 10x. Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has soared 7x. Then there's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with its share price skyrocketing in the ballpark of 19,400%.\n\nBut those impressive returns are now history. Which of these stocks is likely to deliver a 5x gain by 2030?\n\nStrong growth prospects all around\n\nI think all five of these stocks should have strong growth prospects going forward. They share a common tailwind that's likely to blow hard for years to come -- artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud are poised for tremendous growth, in my view, as IT spending shifts from on-premises to the cloud. The scramble to build AI functionality should accelerate this trend. Nvidia will almost certainly be a direct beneficiary of this migration. The company's GPUs remain the favorite chip for powering AI apps.\n\nMeta isn't a cloud provider or a chipmaker. However, the company's open-source approach to developing AI could pay off nicely over the long term. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks that the benefits of this strategy include increased AI safety and security, a greater ability to integrate new AI innovations into Meta's products, and a competitive advantage in hiring the best developers and researchers.\n\nAI isn't the only growth driver for these five stocks, though. Amazon still has plenty of room to run in the e-commerce market and other areas it's expanding into, including healthcare. Microsoft's opportunities include gaming, especially with the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Alphabet has its famous \"other bets,\" such as healthcare-focused Calico and Verily. Meta is investing heavily in developing the metaverse. Nvidia's initial success came from powering gaming apps, and it still represents a major growth market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNarrowing the list\n\nI like all of these stocks. I think all of them could deliver solid long-term returns. But we must narrow the list to pick a winner.\n\nWhich is the first to be eliminated? My pick is Meta. The company won't profit as directly from AI as the three cloud service providers or Nvidia. Meta's big bet on the metaverse might not pay off by 2030 (or possibly ever). Its social media platforms, while continuing to dominate, don't have as much growth potential as they have in the past.\n\nNext on the chopping block for me is Amazon. E-commerce remains the company's biggest revenue source. As mentioned previously, it's still a growth opportunity for Amazon. However, that opportunity isn't as great as the ones that other companies on our list have. This could make it more challenging for Amazon stock to soar by 5x by 2030.\n\nI'm going to reluctantly strike Microsoft off the list as well. My primary determining factor here is valuation. Microsoft's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on Wall Street's consensus five-year growth projections is over 2x, the highest multiple of all of these stocks except Amazon. Granted, those growth projections could be overly pessimistic. Still, I suspect that it would be more difficult for Microsoft stock to increase by 5x going forward because of its starting valuation.\n\nThe finalists\n\nThat leaves two finalists -- Alphabet and Nvidia. Choosing between them is tough.\n\nIn addition to continued growth with its current apps and Google Cloud, Alphabet could have a massive growth driver with its Waymo self-driving car business. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest predicts that the robotaxi market could be worth $9 trillion by 2030. Waymo is likely to be a leader in that market. Google also ranks as a top innovator in quantum computing technology, which could be another game-changer.\n\nAlphabet does face some risks, though. Ark Invest's robotaxi market prediction could be way too optimistic. It could take much longer to achieve the potential for quantum computing than anyone expects. AI-powered virtual assistants could dampen Google Search's growth down the road. Alphabet's \"other bets\" could be disappointing.\n\nWhat about Nvidia? It's arguably the most important company in the world right now. Every other company on our list (plus thousands of others) relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang thinks that the shift to accelerated computing and generative AI \"will drive a doubling of the world's data-center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\" If he's right, Nvidia could realistically deliver a 5x return by 2030.\n\nOn the other hand, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran believes that Nvidia is the most overvalued \"Magnificent Seven\" stock by far, even factoring in strong growth projections. The company also faces increased competition in the AI chip market, which could grow even stronger over the next few years.\n\nMost likely to deliver a 5x gain\n\nSo which stock is most likely to deliver a 5x gain? I'm going to give the nod to Nvidia. The company should profit from pretty much every technology growth market around -- AI, gaming, self-driving cars, the metaverse, and more. That said, I don't think becoming a five-bagger again will be easy for Nvidia (because of the challenges I've already mentioned).\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway from this hypothetical exercise is that all of these stocks could make investors plenty of money over the long run. I don't think you'd go wrong with buying Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia as long as you hold onto the stocks long enough.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Ready to Invest in Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2 Nvidia Alternatives",
        "content": "The broad surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has been boosting the stock market for more than a year now, stretching back to OpenAI's release of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022.\n\nSince then, a handful of early leaders in AI technology have soared into the stratosphere. AI accelerator chips drove Nvidia's stock more than 410% higher in 16 months. High-performance computer systems builder Super Micro Computer rose even faster with a 1,100% gain over the same period.\n\nI understand if you hesitate to buy shares in these skyrocketing AI stocks. What goes up must not necessarily come back down quickly, but the valuation risk is real.\n\nDon't worry, though. There are many ways to tap into the AI boom without relying on the most obvious (and perhaps overvalued) market darlings.\n\nRight now, I see deep value and exciting AI-driven growth in the next few years for Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor: Delivering AI chips to a hungry world\n\nThe demand for AI-driven computing power is skyrocketing. Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC for short, is at the heart of this technological shift.\n\nIn January's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei pointed out that more complex AI software requires more raw computing power, so the demand for faster and more energy-efficient chips should keep rising over time. As an industry-leading provider of advanced manufacturing technologies, Wei's company is poised to benefit from this massive demand surge for years to come.\n\n\"The value of TSMC's technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor components in AI,\" Wei said.\n\nWei's analysis highlights TSMC's strategic position to make the most of the ongoing explosion in AI applications. Although its stock performance has been decent, with a roughly 70% rise since November 2022, TSMC's crucial role in enabling the next wave of AI advancements suggests the stock has room to grow.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvery chip designer worth its silicon wants to tap into the AI frenzy, and TSMC is there to turn its clients' visionary AI dreams into physical chips. For example, Nvidia is one of the company's most important customers. TSMC lets you invest in a company that's powering the future of technology, making it a prudent behind-the-scenes choice amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet: Time to cash in on decades of quiet AI leadership\n\nAlphabet's commitment to integrating AI across its suite of advertising products underscores its strategic vision.\n\nThe Google parent's senior leadership is clear on AI's transformative potential. In its fourth-quarter call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler emphasized the company's long-standing commitment to AI-driven tools and platforms.\n\n\"AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time,\" Schindler said. \"And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting, creative, as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences.\"\n\nAlphabet's measured approach to AI integration should keep the company near the absolute top of consumer-facing online services for years to come. At the same time, the stock's modest gains during the AI surge suggest an underappreciated upside. Trading at a modest 23 times earnings with stock gains barely beating the broader market in the last 16 months, Alphabet's stock isn't getting the AI-based respect it deserves from market makers.\n\nThe company's innovations, particularly in making advanced AI tools accessible to a broader range of advertisers, position it to leverage the next wave of AI advancements. For investors, Alphabet is not just keeping pace with AI evolution but is actively leading it. This company's role in the digital economy could become even more indispensable over time.\n\nIn other words, Alphabet looks like an undervalued AI titan today. Don't hesitate to give this stock a serious look the next time you have some investable cash in search of a forever home.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an \"AI cold shower,\" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.\n\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.\n\nOn February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have.

(NYSE:S) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity software company that specializes in endpoint protection, cloud security, and security data analytics. Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions. The company is also leveraging its single data store and AI capabilities to cross-sell more products into its existing customer base and increase average sale prices. Between larger deal sizes and improving operating efficiencies, we believe the company can continue to expand margins at a significant rate and begin generating positive free cash flow in the next fiscal year.”\n\n11.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch. One outlier right now is Nvidia which is capturing 80% margins..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Could The Market Be Wrong About Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",
        "content": "With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n26% = US$74b ÷ US$283b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Alphabet has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 8.7% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.8%.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is GOOGL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Alphabet Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nAlphabet doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "The threat that forced Google’s co-founder out of retirement",
        "content": "Google co-founders Sergey Brin (left) and Larry Page in 2003. Brin has come out of retirement to address the risk AI poses to his search engine - JOKER/Martin Magunia/ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nIt is one of Silicon Valley’s legendary investments. In 1998, a 34-year-old Jeff Bezos gave $250,000 (£196,000) to a pair of Stanford University students who had developed a new type of search engine.\n\nAt the time, it was a risky bet. Most people browsed the web by using “portals” like Yahoo or by remembering their favourite sites; it was not obvious that searches would be a profitable business.\n\nBut when Google went public in 2004, Bezos’s stake was worth $280m. If he had held on to it, it would now be worth billions.\n\nSo in January, when the Amazon founder invested in a company seeking to take Google’s place in the food chain, people sat up and took notice.\n\nBezos took part in a $74m investment in Perplexity, a San Francisco start-up that aims to answer queries with artificial intelligence rather than a list of links.\n\nType a question into the app – how to roast a chicken – and it will confidently answer with a couple of sentences and a few bullet points, rather than the list of links that made Google famous.\n\nAravind Srinivas, Perplexity’s chief executive, is yet to meet the world’s richest man: he says the two will be catching up soon. But he is fond of quoting a Bezos-ism: “Your [profit] margin is my opportunity.”\n\nSrinivas is betting that just as Google swept away Yahoo as the once-dominant website rested on its laurels, his company will hasten the downfall of the search engine.\n\n“Google is perceived as the de facto place for information and knowledge on the internet,” he says. “That’s going to change.”\n\nPerplexity has around 1m people using it at least once a day, including tech VIPs like Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and Tobi Lütke, the boss of ecommerce site Shopify. That is barely a dent in the billions of Google users, and the search giant is richer than ever: both the company’s profits and its share price hit an all-time high earlier this year.\n\nBut the rise in “answer engines” – AI chatbots that can respond to a query with a succinct answer – has set alarm bells ringing within Google. Last week, co-founder Sergey Brin said he had “come out of retirement” in part to address the rise of systems such as ChatGPT, run by the Microsoft-backed start-up OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe logic behind using AI bots rather than search is straightforward: when most people search the web, they are looking for answers, rather than a particular website. Why be forced to click through a series of links for the thing you are looking for when you could have a simple but comprehensive response?\n\nBut web users may not simply be attracted to simpler alternatives – Google may also be turning them off.\n\nIn January, researchers appeared to confirm what users have complained about for years: Google’s search results appear to be getting worse.\n\nGerman academics found that results from Google as well as rival search engines Bing and DuckDuckGo had become steadily polluted by “search engine-optimised but low-quality content”.\n\nMany of the websites that appeared at the top of search results were designed purely to earn fees from sending users to websites like Amazon, instead of being genuinely useful. The researchers said the problem was likely to increase as AI made it effortless to write Google-optimised web pages instantly.\n\nThe problem is largely a consequence of Google’s success. When the search engine was founded, the web was an untamed wild west of people publishing websites for their own enjoyment. Now, so much of the web’s traffic flows through Google that the economic incentives to rise to the top of search results trump everything else.\n\nThe company has sought to respond. Last week it announced an update to its search algorithm that it said would address spam and “low-quality” sites, reducing them in search results by around 40pc.\n\nNor has Google ignored the AI threat, developing its own Gemini chatbot. But in recent weeks the company has been caught in a storm over its results, after its image generation feature was found drawing black Nazi soldiers.  Brin said Google \"messed up\" after its AI chatbot created images of black Nazis\n\nThe bigger problem is that moving away from its classic search engine threatens to kill the golden goose. Even as Google has invested billions in other pursuits in recent years, its search engine still accounted for the majority of its $307bn in revenues last year.\n\nAI chatbots have obstacles compared to search. The extra computing power required means that it often takes a few seconds for queries to be answered. It also remains to be seen how the bots will be profitable: Perplexity, for example, has no adverts, but charges users $20 a month for a more powerful “Pro” version.\n\nBut some analysts are betting that this can be overcome. Last month the research company Gartner predicted that the number of internet searches would fall by 25pc by 2026.\n\nSrinivas is determined to seize the moment. Reports last week suggested that Perplexity was again raising funds at a $1bn valuation, meaning Bezos’s investment will have almost doubled in a couple of months.\n\n“It’s a tremendous time,” Srinivas says. “The most powerful, profitable business in the history of capitalism is being disrupted because we all want back our time and we don’t want to be taken advantage of anymore.”",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Since stocks began trading on the Nasdaq roughly 50 years ago, the index has only produced negative annual returns 14 times. Over the last 20 years, the index has dropped by at least 30% on three occasions: 2002, 2008, and 2022.\n\nInterestingly, following the precipitous declines of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq rallied for consecutive years thereafter. Between 2003 and 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 16% per year. And in 2009 and 2010, the index produced average returns of 30%.\n\nAfter its painful performance in 2022, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply in 2023, returning 43%. It's safe to say that the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) largely influenced the upswing in tech stocks.\n\nBut 2024 is off to a red-hot start, and further gains could be in store for investors. While each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks below experienced AI-driven momentum last year, I think all of them still look enticing at the moment.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations. The last few years have been brutal for Amazon. Unusually high inflation coupled with the rising interest rates that reined in that inflation have squeezed Amazon's core businesses. Consumers have scaled back their discretionary spending, putting a strain on Amazon's e-commerce efforts. In addition, as companies tightened their budgets, its software businesses witnessed a pronounced growth deceleration. This dynamic can be seen in the ebbs and flows of Amazon's revenue and free cash flow generation below. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut throughout 2023, Amazon made a series of savvy moves that could help reignite its growth. Among them, the company invested billions into OpenAI competitor Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be training future generative AI models on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nInvestors should not overlook the impact AI can have on Amazon. The technology should not only help fuel some renewed interest in AWS, but also integrate into Amazon's e-commerce, streaming, logistics, and advertising businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1 looks like a bargain compared to its historical levels. Now could be a great opportunity to scoop up shares of this under-the-radar AI player.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) kicked off the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Since pouring billions into the start-up, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT across the Windows operating system.\n\nSimilar to Amazon, Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carries some of the most lucrative growth prospects for the company as it relates to AI. The one concern I have about Microsoft is its valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35.5, Microsoft trades at a premium compared to most of its Magnificent Seven peers. While it's reasonable to believe that the expected impacts of AI are baked into Microsoft's price, perhaps more than some of its peers, I don't think the stock is egregiously overvalued.\n\nClearly, investors are placing a premium on the biggest names in AI -- and Microsoft is no exception. Given that AI is in its early innings, I see Microsoft as well-positioned to dominate in the long run. Despite its premium valuation, now could still be a good time to use dollar-cost averaging to add some shares to your portfolio.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) owns two of the world's most visited websites: Google and YouTube. Given Alphabet's commanding surface area on the Internet, it's not a surprise to learn that advertisers are keen to be seen on its platforms.\n\nBut although advertising has long been Alphabet's primary revenue and profit machine, the company is in the midst of an identity crisis. Social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook have become increasingly popular over the last few years -- especially among highly coveted demographics, including Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAs such, growth in Alphabet's advertising business has started to plateau, investor enthusiasm is starting to wane, and Alphabet stock is taking a hit. On a price-to-sales basis, Alphabet is the second cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nNevertheless, I still see many reasons to own Alphabet stock. First, the company is quickly gaining momentum in the cloud computing landscape. What's even better is that its cloud segment is generating positive operating income on a consistent basis, mitigating some of the deceleration in the core advertising business.\n\nMoreover, the cloud is really where Alphabet is focusing its artificial intelligence efforts. So, even though the advertising business is currently facing some challenges, investors can actually buy Alphabet's AI business at a pretty steep discount.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) owns social media apps Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Additionally, the company has a budding metaverse operation via its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) hardware products.\n\nThe last couple of years have been tough for Meta, however. The company pivoted to an all-in approach to the metaverse a couple of years ago. While this was initially met with praise, investors quickly soured on the company after a series of poor earnings reports that featured decelerating growth in the core advertising business and mounting losses.\n\nMeta spent much of 2023 turning things around and shifting its focus back to its bread-and-butter businesses. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith sales and free cash flow on the rise, Meta appears to have climbed its way out of a hole. What's even better is that in the wake of this newfound growth, Meta has found ample ways to reward shareholders. Following its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this year, Meta announced a $50 billion share repurchase and the initiation of a quarterly dividend.\n\nGiven that artificial intelligence can significantly impact both Meta's advertising and metaverse businesses, the long-term ride could just be getting started for the social media conglomerate.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nLast on the list is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a developer of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Make no mistake about it -- the AI narrative largely hinges on Nvidia. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are in high demand as generative AI takes the world by storm.\n\nThe most lucrative thing about Nvidia is that AI touches nearly every aspect of its business -- from data centers to software development and more. What I find most attractive about Nvidia is that it's aggressively deploying its ever-growing profits. The company recently invested in two budding areas of AI: voice-recognition software and robotics. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nWhile the company's market cap has grown by $1 trillion in less than a year, I think the momentum can easily continue. Considering that its outlook is robust for the next several years, Nvidia's valuation seems warranted. Now could be a great time to buy some shares to hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Inside YouTube Music’s meltdown: Former workers say they trained their replacements while staffing firm denies a mass layoff and Google backs away",
        "content": "Shortly after he learned he no longer had a job with YouTube Music, Jack Benedict went back to his office to be met by a cardboard box of some of his stuff that co-workers had thrown together while being ushered out. Most of the team of around 40 employees had already left the building, having learned their contracts had ended and that they'd been given 30 minutes to leave, Benedict tells Fortune. Coming from the city hall, Benedict, 25, was unable to enter his workplace to collect the rest of his things, and says he has yet to be able to re-enter.\n\nLast week, Benedict was one of several dozen unionized workers on the YouTube Music Content Operations Team who found out that they were losing their jobs while testifying to Austin City Council. They were speaking, ironically, about their work—the refusal of Google and Cognizant, whom the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had determined to be their joint employers, to negotiate with their union, which the workers claimed was illegal union-busting. While Benedict was testifying, his co-worker Katie Marschener relayed the sudden news: “They just laid us all off. Our jobs are ended today, effective immediately,” Marschener said. The video of Benedict, obviously surprised, went viral. (Reached for comment, Cognizant spokesperson Jeff DeMarrais said if Benedict “needs help retrieving his things [left behind], that can be arranged very quickly.”)\n\nSince the workers first joined the union, Google has appealed the NLRB’s decision that they are joint employers, which obligates the company to bargain with them, with the board siding with the employees so far.\n\nAfter a long push to get to the bargaining table, Benedict told Fortune that not only were his and his former co-workers' roles suddenly eliminated, but they’ve now been outsourced to workers in India whom Benedict and his colleagues were instructed to train. Those workers were hired after the Austin worker’s first strike last year over returning to the office, says Benedict. Essentially, in his telling, YouTube Music employees were forced to dig their own grave.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benedict, the employees were told that the overseas team would cover whenever there was an American holiday or a union strike. But “it appears that they were having us train our own replacements for the job,” he says, adding that it’s “incredibly frustrating” and it suggests that “Google and Cognizant really don't care about their products.”\n\nCognizant denied that it fired workers in retaliation, while making its opinions regarding the union drive clear. “While we respect the right of our associates to unionize, our philosophy is that we work best together with direct open dialogue and collaboration,” Cognizant spokesperson Jeff DeMarrais said, adding that he’d “like to first challenge you to stop using charged terms like ‘workers’ and other standard rhetoric in your reporting.\" DeMarrais then claimed that Fortune has historically used different terms to refer to union and non-union labor.\n\nBoth companies challenge certain key parts of the account of the YouTube Music workers. When it comes to who is responsible for negotiating with the union and who terminated them, Google shirks responsibility. Cognizant, on the other hand, challenges the notion that workers were laid off entirely.\n\nA representative from Google told Fortune that members of the YouTube Music team weren’t Google employees and that “Cognizant is responsible for these workers’ employment terms, including staffing.” The spokesperson added that Google had no objections to the unionization, but said the company plans to appeal NLRB’s joint-employer ruling.\n\nGoogle added that removal of benefits and outsourcing training process is Cognizant's sole domain and choice. “We’ve long had many contracts with unionized suppliers and we expect everyone who we contract with to treat their employees fairly, whether they are unionized or not,” a spokesperson from Google said. “We do not select or alter contracts based on whether our suppliers have unionized workforces and we do not treat anyone differently if they choose to join a union or not.”\n\nThere are currently 11 open unfair labor practice charges filed against Cognizant and Google, a spokesperson from the NLRB tells Fortune. When asked for a response to these charges, DeMarrais said that “all matters pertaining to the NLRB will be discussed in court, which is the appropriate forum for that conversation.” Google did not answer this question.\n\nIn response to last week's incident, the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America (AWU-CWA) is filing another Unfair Labor Practice charge with the NLRB against Google and Cognizant, it said in a statement to Fortune. Pressing charges on behalf of the laid off team at YouTube Music, the union alleges that \"workers were unlawfully terminated by Google and Cognizant in retaliation for their union organizing.\"\n\nThe outsourcing allegation\n\nDeMarrais did not address the claim that Austin-based workers were replaced by employees in India, which has also made the rounds on TikTok, but said that the workers weren’t laid off. Instead “they have become part of Cognizant’s deployable talent pool where they are given seven weeks of dedicated, paid time to explore other roles within the organization and build new skills through our training ecosystem.”\n\nYouTube Music workers have been petitioning to negotiate for about a year now. Looking for better pay, benefits, and more flexible work, the workers struggled to get their employers to the bargaining table. For Benedict, the abrupt end to his job is just the latest development in a yearslong process. “They're not done with us yet,” he tells Fortune. “We are absolutely going to keep fighting. We want justice. I think our employers, or former employers, would love it if we just moved on and forgot about it,” he adds. He says that what justice looks like isn’t clear right now, but vows that the union will push back.\n\n“I think everyone's pretty sick of not being paid for the hard work that they do, losing their jobs while the corporations make record profits,” Benedict asserts. “Something's not right. And it really needs to change. I'm hoping that our campaign can help change that.” (Google parent Alphabet reported record net income in the fourth quarter of last year, at $20.7 billion, although its peak on an annual basis was $76 billion in 2021.)\n\nThe unionization effort was already brewing when Benedict first joined YouTube Music in a fully remote role in September 2022, according to his LinkedIn. Last April, workers voted 41-1 to be represented by Communications Workers of America. Shortly after the team went public with their efforts, Google and Cognizant announced a new five-days-a-week return to office mandate, according to Benedict. The new policy was “essentially a layoff for the many people on our team who didn't live in Austin, or even Texas,” he explains, adding that they went on strike in response. Cognizant spokesperson DeMarrais said the company “communicated its return to office policy to our Austin-based employees repeatedly since December 2021. Any other depiction of that timeline is mythical and rhetoric.”\n\nCognizant and Google point fingers, YouTube Music workers ushered out\n\nBoth Google and Cognizant say that they didn’t terminate employees but that the contract ended naturally. DeMarrais, the Cognizant spokesperson, told Fortune that the contract’s end was pre-planned.\n\nBut Benedict says that it was “absolutely a layoff,” pointing to his shell-shocked demeanor in the City Hall video. “We had absolutely no idea that this was going to happen,” he tells Fortune. Even though it was a contract gig, according to Benedict, the union was led to believe the contract with Google would be renewed. Other Google layoffs typically involve giving months notice, but YouTube Music workers were given 30 minutes to leave the office, according to Benedict.\n\nThe union backs Benedict’s account. “Google and Cognizant have claimed that what happened last Thursday to the YouTube Music Content Operations Team was the planned expiration of a contract in the course of ’business as usual. In reality, workers were informed midday that their jobs were gone, effective immediately, and put on a timer to gather their belongings,” Alphabet Workers Union-CWA shares in a statement to Fortune.\n\nBut the former YouTube Music team is feeling the blow, even if both employers shunt blame to the other party. “It's just a very, very obvious example that they are trying to bust our union. And I think it's made even more obvious by the fact they had us train a team in India to do the same thing and that team did not lose their job” even when the Google contract ended, says Benedict. “Only the unionized people in Austin lost their job with Google and Cognizant.”\n\nCognizant maintains that the former YouTube Music team was not laid off, but “will become part of Cognizant’s deployable talent pool, better known as our ‘bench.’” DeMarrais said that \"tens of thousands of Cognizant employees move between active projects via the bench,\" and two members of his own team were hired from the bench.\n\nBut Benedict believes this bench is merely a holding pen before an eventual layoff. “We don't know of anybody who's ever been rehired from the bench,” he says. He adds that the bench itself is “besides the point,” noting that the union members were fighting for their specific jobs for which they were trained for and have expertise in.\n\nAnd the entire contracting system appears to purposely cloud who is responsible for the worker’s rights, adds Benedict. “It seems to be their design … Google and Cognizant can point fingers at one another to avoid responsibility for negotiations.” He explains that it’s been hard to speak to any actual person from either company, and the union has in the past received one-word answers when requesting information. In response, Cognizant said “there were regular, in-person weekly standup meetings in the Austin office so it ‘being hard to speak to an actual person’ simply isn’t true.” He added that Benedict “chose not to be in the office on the day that our associates were notified of the contract expiry (during the regular, in-person weekly standup meetings).” Google told Fortune that communication was Cognizant’s responsibility.\n\nContractors challenge corporations\n\nEven before a year of challenging layoffs, the tech world wasn’t exactly the dreamy world it was portrayed as, especially for contractors. “There's the assumption that because we work for YouTube, or we work in tech that we made six figures, had amazing benefits, [and] work fully remote,” says Benedict. But the stereotype couldn’t be further from the situation at hand.\n\nWorking in-office five days a week, Benedict was paid only a little more than $19 an hour. Navigating an expensive city and a “brutal” commute, workers were also dealing with a loss of benefits as their 40 hours of paid sick leave were taken away when the CDC declared the pandemic over, and many workers came in sick, according to Benedict. DeMarrais did not respond to a question about the sick leave policy. Google, once again, said this policy regarding benefits was not in their domain but Cognizant’s.\n\n“People were struggling to make ends meet,” says Benedict, adding that some employees were single parents and many worked multiple jobs to supplement their income. Even as inflation raged, wages had stayed at the same rate since 2019, when the project began, according to Benedict.\n\nStill, Benedict and his former co-workers are motivated to keep pushing. He tells other tech workers “the union fight is absolutely worth it,” and that the “more people that join the fight, the more likely we are to change the system that is working to underpay us.”\n\nHaving previously worked in a warehouse in a small town in Wisconsin that was also unionizing, Benedict believes that this is a movement from working class people across generations. A report from the think tank the Economic Policy Institute found that major strike activity skytocked by 280% last year. Taking note from past wins of the UAW as well as WGA and SAG-AFTRA, Benedict explains it’s exciting that YouTube Music workers’ efforts have “la[id] some of the groundwork for the rights of contractors and temps.”\n\nThe team at YouTube Music is fairly young and feeling the generational burns of navigating an especially volatile economy and a crumbling social contract between employers and employees. “The system has been not good for us,” says Benedict, speaking of a ballooning price in college, rent, and affording housing.\n\n“We’re coming into a world that's not set up for us to succeed,” Benedict says of his generation, “as well as just anyone who's doing some sort of working class job, it's not working for them either.” Adding that he wants to keep fighting and hopes to do some good in the world, Benedict says “people are just fed up, and I think we're gonna see some positive change coming real soon.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alison Williams)",

        "title": "What does the future of driverless taxi service in Los Angeles look like? It's already here",
        "content": "Passengers ride in a car outfitted with Waymo full self-driving technology in Santa Monica in February. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLos Angeles commuters: Don't be alarmed, but driverless taxis may soon become a more common site on local streets.\n\nOn March 1, state regulators gave Waymo, the self-driving taxi company owned by Google's parent, Alphabet, the green light to expand its robotaxi service to Los Angeles County, clearing the way for the company’s expansion into one of the biggest markets in the country.\n\nWhile local transportation agencies deal with day-to-day traffic operations in their respective jurisdictions, the California Public Utilities Commission oversees the regulation of driverless vehicles across the state, superseding local governments.\n\nWaymo has not disclosed a timeline for when its service will become widely available, but a handful of Waymo vehicles are already roaming about the county, including around the USC campus, as part of its ongoing testing and promotion program.\n\nUnder its new approval agreement, Waymo's driverless fleet can operate in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, East Los Angeles, Compton and many more locales.\n\nHere’s what we know so far about the future of driverless taxis in L.A. County:\n\nWhat is a Waymo One vehicle and how does it work?\n\nJust like Lyft or Uber, Waymo One is a ride-hailing service, with prices based on the distance for each trip. But unlike those other services, there will be nobody to make small talk with while riding in a Waymo One vehicle because the vehicles are controlled by computer software.\n\nPassengers input their destination via an app and can sit in the front or the backseat, but are not allowed in the driver’s seat, according to Waymo.\n\nThe company currently uses the all-electric SUV Jaguar I-Pace as part of its fleet in San Francisco and Phoenix, which are equipped with lidar, cameras, radar and an AI platform to safely maneuver through traffic.\n\nWaymo, previously known as the Google self-driving car, developed its AI software with electric vehicle brand Zeekr and China Euro Vehicle Technology AB, or CEVT.\n\nStory continues\n\nDriving automation can be broken down into six categories, according to the standards-setting organization Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). On a scale of 0 to 5, with the lowest being a human being in complete control of the vehicle and 5 being fully automated, Waymo’s vehicles could be categorized as 4 or 5, according to the SAE.\n\nWhere will Waymo’s vehicles be deployed in Los Angeles County?\n\nA Waymo spokesperson said the company will “take a careful and incremental approach to expansion” while working with city officials, local communities and other groups to make sure the service is safe and accessible to its customers.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles has given several companies permission to operate driverless vehicles across the state. Waymo is allowed to deploy its fleet at all times of day in its designated domains. The vehicles can operate in inclement weather, rain and fog, with speeds up to 65 mph.\n\nIn L.A. County, Waymo will be deployed to portions or all of the following cities:\n\nBell Bell Gardens Beverly Hills Carson Commerce Compton Cudahy Culver City El Segundo Gardena Hawthorne Huntington Park Inglewood Lawndale Long Beach Los Angeles Lynwood Manhattan Beach Maywood Paramount Redondo Beach Santa Monica South Gate Torrance Vernon West Hollywood\n\nWhat should a passenger do if their driverless vehicle gets into a fender bender?\n\nWaymo provides customers with a list of frequently asked questions after they enroll with the service that provides basic information about their ride, but the company declined to answer specifics about what a passenger should do if they’re involved in a fender bender while riding in one of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn a Nov. 2023 MarketWatch article, Waymo's Tilia Gode, head of risk and insurance, compared the insurance carried on Waymo's vehicles to the coverage a rental car company has for its vehicles.\n\n“Just like any commercial entity, we have insurance coverage in place that covers the Waymo driver over the course of the driving task,” Gode explains. “Essentially, there’s a shift from human being drivers to the autonomous system being the driver — Waymo is the driver.”\n\nSo, where does that leave its passengers?\n\nWell, that’s where the rubber meets the road.\n\nLike any company that offers its service through an app, customers enter into an agreement when they sign up with Waymo. Passengers are supposed to report any damage to the exterior or interior of the vehicle during their ride and could be held responsible for that damage if it’s discovered at a later time, according to the terms of service.\n\nThat includes a collision, flat tire or any reason the vehicle is not able to reach its destination.\n\n“I would strongly suggest that somebody immediately involve law enforcement, even if it’s not a category of crash where reporting is mandatory,” said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate law professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\nGetting a police report that shows the narrative of events is a good idea and can allow for police to interact with Waymo if there is any type of investigation.\n\nWhat if a Waymo vehicle strikes a pedestrian, bicyclist or someone’s property?\n\nThere are decades of legal cases when it comes to car collisions and drivers, but not so much for driverless vehicles.\n\nGregory Keating, professor of law and philosophy with the USC Gould School of Law, said there’s a lot of speculation about how those autonomous vehicles will fit into existing law.\n\nThe question becomes whether a case will turn on product liability, the vehicle, the software that trained the AI or all of the above in a lawsuit.\n\n“We’re entering into new territory,” Keating said. “The operator of the vehicle, like Waymo or GM, should be liable, but it’s not clear if it will play out that way.”\n\nBecause Waymo’s vehicles are equipped with cameras, all of the events leading up to any type of collision will be recorded by the vehicle, Smith said, but that footage is also Waymo’s property.\n\nLaw enforcement could procure that footage as part of an investigation, and a lawyer could seek it as part of a lawsuit or a state agency overseeing the program could request the data.\n\nSmith notes that the public is deeply concerned about every instance where an autonomous vehicle is involved in a car crash, but over 40,000 people are killed each year in motor vehicle crashes, according to federally available data.\n\nStill, the burgeoning driverless car industry garners public attention because they’re now joining other commuters on the road — albeit sometimes a bit bumpy.\n\nIn February, a bicyclist in San Francisco was struck by a Waymo vehicle, causing minor injuries, according to Reuters.\n\nWaymo reported that its autonomous vehicle was at a complete stop at a four-way intersection when a large truck crossed the intersection toward the Waymo vehicle. When it was the Waymo vehicle’s turn to proceed, the car moved forward, but did not detect the bicyclist that was following the truck, which was obscured. The Waymo vehicle braked heavily, but it was not able to avoid a collision, according to the company.\n\nPolice were called to the scene and the Department of Motor Vehicles was notified about the incident.\n\nIn another incident, an autonomous vehicle operated by GM struck a motorcyclist in San Francisco. The motorcyclist received some minor injuries as a result of the collision, according to court records in a lawsuit that followed.\n\nIn subsequent legal papers referencing the incident, legal experts spoke about the vehicle as if it were a person, using language like “the vehicle was driving unreasonably” and the “vehicle was negligent” as though it were the one that was being sued, Smith said.\n\nHow are autonomous vehicles being received by local jurisdictions?\n\nThere is a healthy dose of skepticism because state regulators have final say over where driverless vehicles can roam.\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass asked regulators in November to increase their scrutiny of autonomous vehicles and said the city should have a say in how they are regulated.\n\nAt the time, she pointed to one of the Waymo driverless cars operating in Los Angeles that had failed to initially stop for a traffic officer at Beaudry Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard on Aug. 3, 2023. The officer had been signaling east- and westbound traffic to come to a stop.\n\nBefore the California PUC’s approval, San Mateo County Atty. John D. Nibbelin protested, saying the county didn’t have enough information on the expansion plans or enough engagement with Waymo.\n\n“The ‘quick and simplified’ advice letter review process ... is insufficient to develop the evidence necessary to fully understand the potential impacts and issues Waymo’s expansion into San Mateo County will create, including accounting for the differing needs and hurdles Waymo will face operating in San Mateo County,” Nibbelin’s letter to the commission stated.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement surrounding the rollout of driverless vehicles, Keating with USC said, and it raises a lot of questions about how existing laws will hold a company responsible for a driverless vehicle. But so far Waymo’s track record is above par.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle can perform the same type of maneuvers a driver can without any hesitation.\n\n“But there could be that one situation that makes people go, ‘Oh, that’s kind of spooky that the vehicle did that,’” Keating said. “All it takes is one incident to scare people.”\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

        "title": "20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development",
        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development.\n\nGlobal R&D Outlook\n\nAccording to the R&D report by AAAS, global investments in research and development have witnessed a significant surge over the past 20 years. The global R&D investments tripled from $672 billion in 1992 to more than $2.2 trillion by 2021. However, the aftermath of the pandemic hindered this growth, with a decline in annual increases to less than 2% in 2020 and 2021, compared to 3.6% in the last decade. Although there are reporting limitations from China to quantify its data, it is evident that it is the largest contributor to non-OECD investments. OECD countries are continuously increasing their R&D spending. In 2021, the R&D investments by OECD countries reached 2.71%. The business sector is the key driver of these investments, accounting for over 60% of R&D investments in 2020. The R&D intensity of the US surpassed 3% in 2019 after ranging between 2.5% to 3% for over two decades. South Korea and China also experienced substantial growth over the past decade, with their R&D spending surging from 2.1% to 4.6% and from 0.9% to 2.2%, respectively. Germany's research and development spending also reached 3.2% in 2019.\n\nGlobal Tech Investments\n\nThe strong research and development portfolio of countries globally reflects directly on the pace of technological advancements in today's world. With the growing digital and tech adoption, the world is continuously advancing toward key technology trends such as AI, cloud computing, quantum science, and edge computing. The workforce in the tech sector is a major driver of the growth of the tech sector. Tech-related fields experienced a 15% rise between 2021 and 2022. Nearly 1 million job postings were publicized by applied AI and next-generation software development between 2018 and 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn March 5, Reuters reported that China outlined plans to strengthen its self-sufficiency in the tech sector. The country aims to focus on emerging trends such as quantum computing and AI. This plan is a result of the current trade tensions with the US. China will introduce major science and technology programs and utilize its political systems to integrate capabilities and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers. Moreover, it plans to develop a robust pool of researchers and innovators to fuel domestic advancements across various tech domains.\n\nSome of the most technologically advanced countries such as the US, China, and South Korea are also actively investing in AI. According to research from Bloomberg Intelligence, the global AI market is anticipated to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. PwC estimates that AI could lead to a staggering contribution of $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Additionally, AI is expected to fuel an increase of 26% in the GDP of local economies by 2030. The United States is leading the ongoing AI  race with the highest number of AI startups. For instance, Anthropic is a leading AI startup in the US, backed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On March 4, Reuters reported that the Silicon Valley startup, Anthropic released its latest suite of AI models, Claude 3. The model claims to outshine competitors such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Gemini 1.0 Ultra. The Claude 3 Opus will be ideal when dealing with complex tasks such as financial analysis.\n\nCompanies Driving Innovation in the Tech Sector\n\nSome of the top companies driving innovation in the tech sector include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOn January 19, the global tech leader, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that AWS will be making a significant investment of 2.26 trillion yen into its cloud infrastructure in Japan by 2027. This investment will contribute to the rising demand for cloud services in the country and also add to Japan's digital transformation.  Moreover, the project will induce a positive economic impact, supporting jobs and fueling GDP.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading tech company, specializing in robotics, AI, HPC, and autonomous vehicle technology. On February 6, the company announced that it had allied with digital communications technology company, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to provide robust and manageable AI infrastructure solutions to businesses. The partnership aims to manage the growing demand for secure and efficient tools to deploy AI at scale. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will leverage Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) networking capabilities to offer a diverse suite of solutions. It will also integrate its GPUs into Cisco servers, granting access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Moreover, Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) AI-assisted management and monitoring tools will facilitate infrastructure operations.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched the next generation of its large language model, Gemini 1.5 with significant improvements compared to its predecessors. The new model will deliver improved performance and will have a novel MoE architecture enhancing its efficiency. The Gemini 1.5 will be capable of processing up to 1 million tokens. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has initially released the language model with a standard context window of 128,000 tokens, with restricted access to 1 million tokens through an early access program.\n\nNow, let's have a look at the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. 20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\n20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development, we utilized the R&D Expenditure as a percentage of GDP data from the World Bank. However, this data does not tell us about the overall economic size of a country. So, we calculated the absolute spending in USD for each country.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nStocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a \"Goldilocks\" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.\n\nThe 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February \"60 Minutes\" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an \"overbought\" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains \"overbought\" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of \"overbought\" for three consecutive months or more.\n\nStory continues\n\nBofA analysts commented:\n\n\"A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.\"\n\nSome of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's holdings that seeks to track the investment results of S&P Total Market Index, which is composed of U.S. equities.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”\n\n8.

But when they take their laptops to the office’s first floor, which has comfortable chairs for meetings and “collaborative” work, many find they are unable to access wireless internet.\n\nGoogle has issued some staff with laptops featuring more powerful WiFi receivers while others have been encouraged to sit outside at the office’s cafe, where there are stronger connections. Others have taken to using their phone’s mobile signal as a hotspot rather than relying on the company’s WiFi\n\nThe spotty internet signals have jeopardised Google’s effort to get staff to return to the office three days a week, some employees said.\n\nA Google spokesman told Reuters: “We’ve had WiFi connectivity issues in Bay View.”\n\nHe added that the company had made several improvements to address the issue.\n\nGoogle’s Bay View campus, which sits near its headquarters, is described by the company as the first built by the business itself from the ground up. It is powered by solar and wind energy 90pc of the time and is designed so that every employee has a view of a window.\n\nIt was designed by the Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studio, run by the English designer Thomas Heatherwick.\n\nIt houses around 4,000 staff including those working on its latest artificial intelligence systems.",

        "title": "1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Alphabet Stock Is Going to $170. Is It a Buy Around $130?",
        "content": "As the seemingly eternal leader in internet search, Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made a great many investors richer over the course of its more than 25-year history. Lately, though, it hasn't been the most exciting stock, neither soaring higher nor crashing violently in price on the tech sector's gyrations.\n\nSome believe it's being unfairly ignored by the market, and the market is missing a chance to get a solid investment at a cheap price. Let's explore one analyst's bullish take on the company.\n\nUndervalued and underappreciated\n\nAs February came to a close, Redburn-Atlantic's James Cordwell upped his price target on Alphabet's class A voting shares (the ones with the GOOGL ticker symbol). These should be worth $170 apiece, according to him, up from his previous level of $165. In making his change, Cordwell maintained his buy rating on the shares.\n\nThat makes for a potential gain of around 30% on both classes of Alphabet's stock, given that they're hovering around the $130 level these days and they trade at basically the same level.\n\nCordwell feels that Alphabet is priced more like a traditional blue chip stock in an unexciting industry than a leader dominating a corner of the tech sector. He wrote in a note that with \"Alphabet's forward P/E now just in line with that of the [S&P500 index] sentiment has clearly turned negative regarding Google Search's competitive position and ongoing growth potential.\"\n\nTaken for granted?\n\nIt can be tough for a company that's been so firmly established in its niche to win investor love.\n\nWith longevity, more people can take a business for granted and forget that it still might have powerful growth in front of it. Technological advances will make internet search more of a valuable resource, not less, and there's no meaningful competition to the powerhouse that is Alphabet. That makes Cordwell's latest take on the stock rather compelling and $130 looks like a cheap price for a company with a bright future.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Congress moved a step closer to forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell the popular video-sharing platform over national security concerns, with a committee advancing legislation Thursday that would block app stores and internet service providers from offering it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap Biden to Direct Military to Build Gaza Port to Deliver Aid New York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight Crime\n\nTikTok mounted a last-minute effort to counter the bill, which was unveiled Tuesday, by urging its users to call congressional offices to protest the bill via a message that greeted them when they opened the app. Users flooded members offices with calls, drawing the ire of House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher.\n\nLawmakers said “their phones were ringing off the hook last night,” Gallagher told journalists outside the Capitol on Thursday. “The intimidation tactics, the disinformation has to stop,” he said later in a video message.\n\nIn the end the campaign was unsuccessful, at least in preventing lawmakers from taking the first step toward enacting the legislation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 50-0 Thursday to approve the bill and advance it toward the House floor.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have long expressed national security concerns over TikTok’s ties to its owner ByteDance Ltd., citing risks of the Chinese government collecting personal data from American users and spreading propaganda on the app. The platform has been under a national security review since the Trump administration. The Biden administration has signaled cautious support for the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying Wednesday that “we would want to see this bill get done.”\n\nStory continues\n\nPrevious legislative attempts to restrict the app nationwide have failed, and this one would still have to clear legislative hurdles in the House and Senate. But lawmakers say this latest effort has been months in the making, fueled partly by renewed security concerns that China is surveilling Americans. The legislation would give ByteDance six months to divest from TikTok.\n\nRead More: TikTok Can Keep ‘Bad Lip-Sync,’ Lawmakers Seeking Sale Say\n\nTikTok has consistently denied that it has or will share any US user data with Beijing and has tried to assuage US concerns by spending more than $1.5 billion to isolate its US operations and agreeing to oversight from American partner Oracle Corp. TikTok said in a statement that the legislation would trample First Amendment free speech rights and deprive millions of small businesses of a platform on which they rely.\n\nThe app is already emerging as an important place for conversations in a presidential election year. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has even created an account on the app ahead of November’s vote. More than 170 million Americans scroll the app every month, making its users an important asset.\n\nAfter the vote, TikTok said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that the new bill “has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.”\n\n(Updates with detail on TikTok’s influence with voters)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall Humanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Amazon’s generative AI bot Rufus makes online shopping easier (for the most part)",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is bringing generative AI to its shopping app via its new Rufus chatbot. I’ve used a good deal of generative AI apps so far, and they’ve largely focused on searching the web, helping write emails, and making putting together PowerPoints a bit less, well, hellish.\n\nRufus, however, is designed to make shopping quicker and easier by providing you with answers to questions about product categories and individual items. The chatbot, which is trained on Amazon’s product catalog and web data, appears at the bottom of the Amazon shopping app as a tab that you swipe up to access. It doesn’t replace the regular search bar at the top of the screen. Rather, it serves as a means of expanding on it.\n\nOf course, if Rufus takes off among consumers, it will be a major win for Amazon. That’s because the chatbot could get users to spend more time in Amazon’s shopping app and less time looking up information about products on Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which could lead them to buy goods through competing online stores.\n\nI got an early look at a beta version of Rufus to see how well it works. And while it isn’t perfect, it did make shopping for things like video games, cat food, and weightlifting equipment easier.\n\nI needed windshield wipers for my car, so I typed wipers into the search bar at the top of the screen. Rufus then appeared in a small box at the bottom of the screen with suggested follow-up questions such as “What are the different types of windshield wipers available?”, “How do I choose the right windshield wiper size for my vehicle?”, and “What are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?” Rufus can provide a rundown of different types of products such as windshield wipers. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nTap a suggestion, and you’ll get the appropriate answer. For instance, tapping “What are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?” gave me a list of items to consider, including blade type, blade size, wiper rubber quality, and adapter type. Riveting stuff, I know. But if you’re tired of hearing your wipers screech like nails on a chalkboard every time it rains, these are the kinds of things you want to know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nI also needed — well, wanted — to shop for the game “Final Fantasy VII Remake.” The problem is there are a few versions of this game on the market, and deciding which one to buy can be a pain. So I decided to check with Rufus to see if it could distinguish between the versions of the game, and, to my surprise, it did just that.\n\nNot only did Rufus manage to tell the difference between the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, it also knew the differences between the base version of the game and an expanded version. Rufus provided an in-depth explanation of the differences between the two versions of the game \"Final Fantasy VII Remake.\" (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nBut here’s where Rufus trips up. One of the follow-up questions it offered was “What are the best weapons and armor to get in ‘Final Fantasy 7 Remake?'” The chatbot gave me a basic rundown of how to pick weapons and armor in the game, choose items that hit an enemy’s weaknesses, etc., but it then brought up buying options for a “Final Fantasy VII” character action figure and a seemingly unrelated wig.\n\nThe bot rebounded when I started searching for weight plates for my home gym, providing the pros and cons of metal versus rubber plates, explaining that while metal plates last longer, rubber plates will do less damage to my floor. That kind of insight can be incredibly useful for someone who’s just getting into lifting and doesn’t know which kind of plate to buy.\n\nBut when I changed up the question to \"What are differences between metal plates and rubber plates?\" it became confused and gave me a search option for metal dining plates, but a description of metal weightlifting plates. Rufus can get confused when asking questions. Here, it couldn't distinguish between whether I was asking about metal weightlifting plates or metal dining plates. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nI also tried looking up some items I should buy for an upcoming trip to Ireland. When I asked Rufus “What should I buy before leaving for vacation in Ireland?” the bot offered an Ireland travel guide book, lightweight rain jacket, sweater, walking shoes, and a power adapter. Rufus provided an explanation for each suggestion, as well, saying that Ireland’s climate can be rainy, and that even in the summer, evening temperatures can be rather cool.\n\nWhen I tapped on a suggested follow-up question asking about the top attractions and destinations in Ireland, Rufus gave me information about certain areas including the Cliffs of Moher and Giant’s Causeway. The app then provided information about each locale, complete with books or movies for purchase related to the areas.\n\nFinally, I tried asking Rufus for the cheapest paper towels. But rather than a straight-up answer pointing me to the least expensive product, the bot gave me a list of popular paper towel brands and a short description of them. Not exactly what I was hoping for. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nWhile Rufus isn’t quite perfect, I did find the AI chatbot helpful with certain purchasing decisions. No, it couldn’t answer all of my questions, but Amazon is careful to label the bot as a piece of beta software. There are also thumbs up and thumbs down buttons you can choose to select to rate Rufus’s responses.\n\nMore generally, I find apps like Rufus to be the most useful early application of generative AI technology. Sure, drafting emails or searching the web is helpful, but a bot that can break down the difference between a handful of products quickly and make purchasing decisions easier is far more interesting.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google has been touting the myriad innovations in the first building wholly designed and built by the web giant, even moving workers in to focus on its highest-profile project: generative artificial intelligence. But, some say they wish the innovations had included decent Wi-Fi.\n\nThe \"Bay View\" building, located on the Alphabet unit's Mountain View, California, headquarters, has been plagued for months by inoperable or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi, according to six people familiar with the matter.\n\nIts recliner-laden collaborative workspaces do not work well for teams carting around laptops, since workers must plug into ethernet cables at their desks to get consistent internet service. Some make do by using their phones as hotspots.\n\nThe company promoted the new building and surrounding campus in a 229-page glossy book highlighting its cutting-edge features, such as \"Googley interiors\" and \"an environment where everyone has the tools they need to be successful.\"\n\nBut, a Google spokeswoman acknowledged, \"we’ve had Wi-Fi connectivity issues in Bay View.\" She said Google \"made several improvements to address the issue,\" and the company hoped to have a fix in coming weeks.\n\nAccording to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week return-to-office mandate.\n\n\"You’d think the world’s leading internet company would have worked this out,\" he said. Like others, he spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity because Google has not authorized them to talk about work conditions.\n\nManagers have encouraged workers to stroll outside or sit at the adjoining cafe where the Wi-Fi signal is stronger. Some were issued new laptops recently with more powerful Wi-Fi chips.\n\nGoogle has not publicly disclosed the reasons for the Wi-Fi problems, but workers say the 600,000-square-foot building’s swooping, wave-like rooftop swallows broadband like the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeneath that oceanic roof, Google employees are racing to roll out the latest versions of the advanced artificial intelligence software known as Gemini, a key to Google's future. Such AI has become a Silicon Valley sensation following the broad release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nAsked by Reuters if the campus has ample Wi-Fi, Gemini appeared cautiously optimistic. \"It is highly likely that the Bay View campus has Wi-Fi,\" the software replied.\n\n\"As the headquarters of a major tech company, Google, it would be surprising if it did not.\"\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Additional reporting by Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo is leaving no stone unturned to expand its ride-hailing service — Waymo One — across the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest move of testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared as the fourth city for Waymo One last year.\r\n\r\nWaymo’s electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, which are equipped with advanced Waymo Driver technology, will be tested across 43 square miles in Austin, which includes the heart of downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin and Hyde Park.\n\nExpansion Efforts by Waymo\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Waymo’s growing efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nRecently, the company entered a multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies UBER to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter’s customers in Phoenix, AZ. Uber, which offers a ride-sharing service, strives to infuse Waymo’s autonomous driving technology into its operations on the back of this partnership.\r\n\r\nIt is in sync with the company’s deepening focus in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nGOOGL’s expansion of the operating area of Waymo One in the city, which now includes rides to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, remains a plus.\r\n\r\nWaymo’s effort to expand its operations to downtown Phoenix remains noteworthy. It also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\r\n\r\nApart from Phoenix, Waymo’s expansion to San Francisco, CA, on the back of its Early Rider program called Trusted Tester, is a major positive. Notably, this marked its first expansion outside Phoenix.\r\n\r\nRecently, Waymo received regulatory approval to expand in the San Francisco Peninsula and Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWaymo is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\n\nGrowth Prospects & Competitive Scenario\n\nThe above-mentioned endeavors will help Alphabet further penetrate the booming autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nPer a Precedence Research report, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $2.35 trillion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 35% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Alphabet’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investors’ confidence in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nNotably, Alphabet has gained 40% in the past year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, expanding Waymo’s efforts will continue to strengthen Alphabet’s competitive position. Its peers like Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU are also making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nZoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.\r\n\r\nIt also plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing facility for its autonomous vehicles. The facility will be located at Hayward Exchange @ 92, 25810 Clawiter Rd. The facility is being built to expand Zoox’s presence in the East Bay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.\r\n\r\nApollo Go is available in ten cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Alphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives are likely to help it stay ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Welcome to the Digital Markets Act. Here’s what you need to know about the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law",
        "content": "Europe’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) finally started hitting Big Tech with tough antitrust obligations today. And what better way to understand its impact than to look at how tech firms have moved to comply—and to take advantage of new opportunities?\n\nBut first, here’s what happens if these so-called gatekeepers—which so far include Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok parent ByteDance—don’t comply. They can get hit with fines of up to 10% of global annual revenue. If they keep breaking the rules, those fines can rise to 20%, and the European Commission can even break businesses up or block them from buying other companies relating to whatever naughtiness is concerned.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in light of how weak enforcement by underfunded national regulators undermined the bite of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, which deals with privacy, the Commission has decided to enforce the DMA itself. The same goes for its sister law, the Digital Services Act, which mostly deals with content-moderation issues. It remains to be seen whether the Commission has the resources to do this effectively for either law, but that’s the plan.\n\nGot that? Cool. Let’s proceed with the changes themselves—and remember, these are Europe-only.\n\nMoving easily to rival services. Many companies have been letting users download their data for years now, but now they’re going beyond that. For example, Google and TikTok-owner ByteDance have launched data portability APIs so users can give other developers permission to directly import their data from the gatekeepers' services—handy for switching service providers, but also potentially for backing up their data.\n\nFreedom from default choices. Remember when Microsoft was once forced to tell Windows users that they had browser options beyond Internet Explorer, like Google’s Chrome? Now Chrome will tell its users that they have other search engine options. And Google will also give Android users a choice of browsers and search engines when they set up their device.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore control over data privacy. Continuing the inexorable bleeding together of data-protection and competition law, people now get to decide if one of these Big Tech conglomerates can keep linking together the data from accounts users have with its various services—something that has big implications for user profiling and ad targeting. So Meta now lets people decouple Facebook and Instagram accounts and Google does the same for YouTube, Search, and its many other services.\n\nChoice of in-app payment services. Google and Apple now let app developers deploy third-party payment mechanisms that aren’t Google Pay and Apple Pay. Google mostly did this in 2022 already, though it’s only now fully expanded the program to game developers. Apple left everything until the last minute. But hey, third-party developers can actually access the iPhone’s NFC tap-to-pay chip now!\n\nInteroperability of services. Gatekeepers don’t have to make their services interoperable with just anyone—nobody wants security to go out the window—but they do need to allow it in principle. So for example, users of Meta’s WhatsApp will soon be able to talk to people on other messaging platforms. (Meta is trying to avoid the same obligation for its Messenger service.)\n\nBusiness data transparency. Business customers of these platforms can now demand easier access to the data they generate. This looks set to have a real impact in the advertising space, as both Google and Amazon are now promising to give advertisers and publishers more data.\n\nNo more anti-steering. Well hello there, Apple. Days after the company was fined $2 billion for refusing to let Spotify and other streaming services inform their iOS users about cheaper off-platform subscription deals, the new rules demand more clearly that gatekeepers let business users “promote offers and conclude contracts with customers outside the gatekeeper's platform.” So that’s definitely now a thing, although Google is trying the interesting tactic of claiming fat fees for these “external offers,” as it calls them. I imagine developers will complain to the Commission about that. But speaking of Apple…\n\nThird-party app stores. Google already allowed third-party app stores on Android, and as of now, Apple must do the same on iOS. The first third party, whose German developers have promised a launch as soon as the DMA comes into force (it isn’t live yet), is Mobivention, which focuses on the enterprise market. MacPaw’s Setapp should follow in April.\n\nHowever, Apple celebrated the advent of the DMA by denying arch-nemesis Epic Games’ attempt to launch a European iOS app store and bring Fortnite back to European iPhones. I don’t have space to explain why here—but you can find my comprehensive explainer here. Tl;dr: Apple’s DMA-compliance hissy fit over the past couple months has somehow become even more outrageous, and it's unlikely to pay off for the company. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just released a video celebrating the advent of the DMA, and it pointedly referred to Fortnite returning to iOS. I checked with her staff, and she definitely recorded it after Apple's latest tantrum.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.\n\nIf any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.\n\nYet its introduction of new fees such as a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.\n\nVestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.\n\nRivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough.

        "title": "2 Trillion-Dollar \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is the apt moniker placed on a group of seven of the world's largest technology companies:\n\nApple  Microsoft  Amazon  Nvidia  Tesla  Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks delivered an average return of 112.7% in 2023, handily outperforming the S&P 500 index, which was up just 24%. Last year, owning all seven of them worked like a charm, but the group is fraying in the early stages of 2024, with Tesla stock plunging 29% and Apple down 12% so far this year.\n\nAs a result, investors might have to be more selective in 2024. Here's why Alphabet and Meta Platforms might be two of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy this month.\n\n1. Alphabet (Google)\n\nGoogle stock came public in 2004, but it created Alphabet in 2015 after expanding beyond its flagship internet search engine. Alphabet is now home to Google and a number of other high-profile subsidiaries, including YouTube, DeepMind, and Waymo. The $1.6 trillion tech conglomerate still rules the internet with Google Search, maintaining a 91% global market share, but investors have been more focused on its progress in artificial intelligence (AI) lately.\n\nMicrosoft made a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and immediately integrated the chatbot into its Bing search engine. Investors grew concerned that Google Search could be disrupted, sparking Alphabet's quest to catch up to Microsoft in the AI race.\n\nFollowing a slate of AI product releases, Alphabet says its latest Gemini chatbot outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, it's better at interpreting and creating text, images, videos, and computer code. Gemini is now available as a stand-alone chatbot, and it can also help businesses craft Search ads. Plus, Google Workspace customers can now access it for an additional fee, empowering them to increase their productivity across Gmail, Docs, Slides, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet delivered $307.4 billion in revenue during 2023, which was a 9% increase from 2022. The advertising-based business of Google Search still accounts for most of the conglomerate's revenue, and it saw an acceleration in growth in the fourth quarter. It's a positive sign the ad market continues to improve following a 2022 slump driven by rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nThose results saw Alphabet stock hit an all-time high in January of this year, but it has since declined by 13%, which presents investors with a buying opportunity.\n\nBased on the company's $5.80 in 2023 earnings per share and its current stock price of $133.35, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 23. That's a 30% discount to the 33 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, and it makes Alphabet the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. That's an incredibly attractive valuation for a company that has quickly become a leader in the AI space.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock price soared 194% in 2023, making it the second-best performer in the entire S&P 500 index behind only Nvidia. AI is one reason Meta Platforms is so popular among investors at the moment, but the company is also reaping the rewards from its expansive cost cuts, which have sent its profits soaring.\n\nMeta is using AI in a few ways. First, it's deploying the technology to deliver more relevant content to users on Facebook and Instagram, which drove an uptick in the amount of time they spent on those platforms during 2023. AI learns what content users like, and it curates their feeds to show them more of it. That additional time allows Meta to feed users more ads, which translates into more revenue for the company.\n\nSecond, Meta gives businesses AI tools to help them craft more engaging ads to drive more conversions. Additionally, each business on Meta's social platforms will eventually be able to deploy their own AI chatbot to handle incoming queries from customers through Messenger and WhatsApp. The chatbot will possess a broad knowledge of each unique business and reflect its core values.\n\nFinally, Meta has developed its own large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's open source whereas the LLMs underpinning generative AI applications like ChatGPT and Gemini are not. This strategy allows Meta to absorb feedback from thousands of developers to eliminate blind spots and accelerate improvements. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced plans to acquire 350,000 industry-leading H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia at an estimated cost of $9 billion, which will speed up Llama's development.\n\nZuckerberg declared 2023 a \"year of efficiency\" following a 76% peak-to-trough plunge in its stock price between 2021 and 2022. He slashed more than 21,000 jobs and committed to moderating the company's spending on initiatives like the metaverse in favor of investing heavily in its core social platforms and AI. The result was a 16% year-over-year jump in revenue and a whopping 73% increase in earnings per share (profit) during 2023.\n\nDespite the 544% gain in Meta stock from its 2022 low point -- which catapulted the company back to a $1 trillion valuation -- it still only trades at a P/E ratio of 33.2, which is basically in line with the Nasdaq-100. Considering Wall Street is forecasting a further 34% earnings growth in 2024, Meta stock still looks cheap at its current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors know that what is bad news for the economy can often be good news for stocks. That’s usually the case when companies announce layoffs. But usually, does not mean always. And in a volatile market, it’s a good time to look at stocks to sell after layoffs.\n\nRemember, a company will prioritize shareholder value over retaining employees. And “cutting the fat” is a way to boost earnings. However, sometimes, even a short-term boost to the bottom line isn’t enough. Some companies have a combination of acute or systemic problems affecting the business. That’s the case with the three companies in this article.\n\nIf you’re so inclined, this may be a time to take a short position in these companies. Otherwise, the best advice is to let the dust settle. In some cases, you can revisit these stocks at a better price. But for now, there are reasons why each of these companies fit into the category of stocks to sell after layoffs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn February, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its long-awaited Gemini AI model. To say it could have gone better is an understatement. Many users quickly found that Gemini generated historically inaccurate images, such as a female Pope.\n\nAfter offering a “mistakes were made” defense that fell short of an apology, Alphabet paused the image generation feature for a few weeks and promised to retrain the AI model. This process should take a few months. Count Elon Musk, one of the loudest critics, as a skeptic.\n\nHowever, the larger issue from an investing standpoint is that this is an unforced error at a time when any slip-up is going to be treated harshly. Analysts don’t necessarily agree. However, it’s worth noting that GOOGL stock was near the top of analysts’ estimates before the recent sell-off. That may generate some buyers, but would the bounce be sustainable?\n\nIn the long run, Alphabet is likely to be fine, particularly after the ongoing layoffs the company has announced. Still, controversies like these have a way of hanging around, especially during an election year. Traders may have some fun here, but there will likely continue to be downward pressure on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nDating apps such as Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) have revolutionized the dating scene. But revolutions often lead to counterrevolutions, which may be taking place in the online dating world.\n\nA recent study from Hinge shows that Gen-Z—a coveted demographic of an app like Bumble—is increasingly losing interest in dating apps or choosing to use them sparingly. The irony is that Gen-Z is the first truly digitally native generation, yet they are the ones citing a desire for authentic human connection.\n\nPerhaps that’s one reason Bumble announced it was letting go of 350 (30%) employees in Feb 2024. The company also plans to introduce several programs that allow for in-person meetups. However, in a sector with plenty of competition and no moat, it’s hard to swipe right on BMBL stock, trading near its 52-week low as of March 5, 2024.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe problem with bubbles is that they burst. Of course, for Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) investors, it’s fair to ask where the bubble was to begin with. RIVN debuted on the market with much fanfare in November 2021 at over $120 per share. Investors had to know that it was too good to last, but many wouldn’t have expected the stock to be changing hands at around $10 per share just over two years later.\n\nThe problem is cost. It’s expensive to make electric vehicles, and consumer demand has not met expectations for several reasons. Rivian hasn’t helped matters by missing delivery targets and diluting its stock in an effort to raise capital.\n\nIn February, the company announced it was letting go of 10% of its workforce. Bulls may hold onto the fact that the company outperformed on its top line when it reported earnings in February. But the bottom line losses are expanding. With no evidence of that changing anytime soon, Rivian is an easy addition to this list of stocks to sell after layoffs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He did not disclose his connection to either company to Google. The Justice Department doesn’t allege that Ding provided either of the companies with specific data he stole from Google.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case marks the first significant enforcement action since Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced last month that the Justice Department’s disruptive technology strike force would focus on violations related to the use or transfer of AI technology.\n\n“After all, AI is the ultimate disruptive technology,” Monaco said during comments at the University of Oxford.\n\nIP Theft\n\nThe US Attorney’s office in San Francisco has in recent years prosecuted multiple cases over intellectual property theft involving China, including three ex-Apple engineers accused of stealing trade secrets from the company’s autonomous driving project to take with them for jobs with Chinese companies.\n\nBut not all the office’s efforts have been successful. Just last month, a Chinese chipmaker targeted in a rare economic espionage case was found not guilty of all charges, ending a five-year pursuit by prosecutors.\n\nDing was arrested Wednesday in Newark. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of as much as $250,000 for each count if convicted.\n\nThe technology Ding allegedly stole “involves the building blocks of Google’s advanced supercomputing data centers, which are designed to support machine learning workloads used to train and host large AI models,” according to the Justice Department release.\n\nWhile he was employed by Google, Ding had access to confidential information about hardware, software and the AI models and applications they supported, some of which he is alleged to have uploaded into personal accounts.\n\n--With assistance from Julia Love.\n\n(Updates with Garland, Google comments.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built Humanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Imagine Elon Musk as Donald Trump’s boss",
        "content": "Here’s a tantalizing, or terrifying, prospect, depending on how you look at it: The world's richest man could get behind Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and use his billions to help Trump get elected.\n\nElon Musk made a recent pilgrimage to Florida to meet with the former president, according to the New York Times, fueling speculation that the Trumpy, irascible CEO of Tesla and SpaceX could get far more involved in presidential politics this year than he ever has before.\n\nMusk later tweeted that he is “not donating money to either candidate for US President.” But Musk is well known for Trumpian turnabouts. “He’s exaggerated, overpromised, skirted facts, and lied,” Rolling Stone wrote last year in a story listing 13 of Musk’s biggest whoppers. So Musk could recant and get behind Trump after all.\n\nMusk, who also owns the social media platform X, certainly fancies himself a geopolitical influencer. In 2022, he pitched a peace plan for the Ukraine war, and he may or may not have spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin to get his views. At certain points in the war, Musk has made decisions about the battlefield use of SpaceX’s Starlink internet service that influenced military outcomes on the ground.\n\nMusk also has strong opinions about “free speech,” electric cars, government regulation, immigration, and other hot-button political issues, just as Trump does. Musk’s a libertarian who seems to be getting more conservative as he gets older, and he’s no fan of President Joe Biden. He called Biden a “damp sock puppet\" in 2022 and has jabbed him on a variety of issues.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, needs money, so the stars might be aligning for a bromance between Trump and the 21st century's wannabe overlord.\n\nIf Musk got behind Trump, there could be tension over who’s really in charge. Musk is nobody’s No. 2, and if he financed Trump’s path to victory, he’d probably want to call the shots on issues that matter to him. Money talks, especially in politics, and Musk has about 100 times as much as Trump. And money wins, especially with Trump.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would Musk want from Trump? If Musk actually helped Trump win the presidency, it’s not hard to imagine these five asks:\n\nDismantle the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk hates the SEC, which punished him for a bogus 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private and has continued to stay up in his grill. Trump hates government regulation about as much as Musk does. Done.\n\nTurn AI over to Tesla. In the wrong hands, artificial intelligence could eliminate all jobs or allow Musk’s business competitors to gain an edge. Only Musk, and maybe Joe Rogan, can safeguard this revolutionary technology and save humanity. All it will take is Justice Dept. pressure and some friendly judges appointed by Trump to force AI divestitures at Microsoft and Google and establish Tesla as the favored bidder.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nBan Facebook. Shut. Them. Down! Shut. Them. Down! Also Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Only X upholds the First Amendment by allowing anybody to say anything. Once X becomes the everything app, there will be no need for other social media platforms, anyway.\n\nHalt all immigration. Except from South Africa.\n\nMake sure space remains nonunionized. Space Force, the agency Trump created, would be the enforcer. Much better than letting Biden’s unions infiltrate space and bring all hopes of colonizing Mars to a halt over trifling issues such as interplanetary working conditions. Then-President Donald Trump meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2017. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) (NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images)\n\nThose are softball requests that align closely with Trump’s own views. Three other Musk requests could be a tougher sell.\n\nElectric cars. Musk made most of his fortune from them, but Trump wants electric car supporters to “rot in hell.” Hmmmm. Awkward. Maybe Trump is persuadable. Musk could give him a ride in a bulletproof Tesla Cybertruck, show off the beast mode, and even let Trump fire some arrows at the vehicle. Before you know it, a stretch version of the Cybertruck could get the next contract for a presidential limousine.\n\nClimate change. Musk says it’s real, Trump says it’s a hoax. But Trump would probably change his story if Musk offered to pay some of his legal fees or court fines.\n\nTruth Social. As a condition of gaining Musk’s support in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump’s social media network would have to buy X for $44 billion. That might seem like a lot until you think about how much money a shrewd self-promoter can make by monetizing the American presidency. And it could all start with the Tesla Cybertruck, President Donald J. Trump Limited Edition.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Google's reputation is at stake in its efforts to fix Gemini, according to an analyst's report published Wednesday.\n\nFiorillo expressed his disappointment in the botched launch and argued it was completely avoidable before predicting, \"This will either lead to Google's destruction as trust from the end user is lost or lead to its resurrection as GOOGL utilizes this moment to crush its competition.\"\n\nGOOGLE GEMINI USING ‘INVISIBLE’ COMMANDS TO DEFINE ‘TOXICITY’ AND SHAPE THE ONLINE WORLD: DIGITAL EXPERT\n\nFiorillo called it \"negligent\" for Google to release Gemini without assuring its accuracy, and voiced concerns over instances where the chatbot provided incorrect answers and generated inaccurate depictions of both current and historical events. Google is scrambling to work out Gemini's bugs after the AI tool provided incorrect answers and showed bias against White people in its initial rollout.\n\nGoogle halted Gemini's image generation feature nearly two weeks ago after users on social media flagged that it was creating inaccurate historical images that sometimes replaced White people with images of Black, Native American and Asian people.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nGOOGLE CO-FOUNDER SAYS COMPANY ‘DEFINITELY MESSED UP’ ON GEMINI'S IMAGE GENERATION\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told employees last week that the company is working \"around the clock\" to fix Gemini's bias, calling the images generated by the model \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe company reportedly plans to relaunch Gemini AI's ability to generate images of people in the next few weeks, and Fiorillo said Google's reputation could hinge on how that goes.\n\n\"All eyes will be on GOOGL as the ball is in their court,\" he wrote. \"GOOGL will either rise like a phoenix from the ashes or allow its competitors to capitalize on this moment and control the narrative about how the results from GOOGL can't be trusted.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Fiorillo is bullish on the company, adding, \"I believe Google won't take this lying down, internal changes will be made, and it will dominate AI-enabled search.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Google's Gemini debacle a make-or-break moment, analyst says",

        "title": "OpenAI’s success has put a huge target on its back",
        "content": "OpenAI is the world’s hottest startup. It not only set the stage for the generative AI explosion thanks to the launch of its ChatGPT in November 2022, but it’s also powering Microsoft’s (MSFT) push into the space via a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that gives the tech giant a roughly 49% stake in the company’s for-profit subsidiary.\n\nThe company is now valued as high as $86 billion, according to Bloomberg. And with its latest product, the generative AI video platform Sora, making waves, CEO Sam Altman and company are riding higher than ever.\n\nBut OpenAI’s success has also put a massive target on its back. The company is facing a slew of headwinds ranging from lawsuits and government investigations to increasing competition from established players like Google. And some of those could pose an existential threat to OpenAI as it’s currently constituted.\n\nLawsuits on lawsuits\n\nOpenAI’s latest trouble comes from a familiar place: co-founder Elon Musk. Last week, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against the generative AI company claiming it is in breach of contract. Musk claims in the suit that OpenAI is in violation of its founding agreement by using its technology to grow its for-profit arm rather than for the benefit of humanity.\n\nMusk wants OpenAI to make all of its technologies public and to prevent it from making any money for Microsoft, which uses OpenAI’s models for its various AI Copilot offerings. After helping to found OpenAI in 2015, Musk left the company in 2018 over disagreements about the company’s future and, last year, founded an AI company of his own called x.AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman participates in the \"Technology in a turbulent world\" panel discussion during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024. (Markus Schreiber/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe New York Times is also suing OpenAI as well as Microsoft, claiming that the companies are benefiting from the use of the Times’ copyrighted material. The Times says OpenAI used its content without permission to train its models, which are now benefiting both the company and Microsoft. The Times wants OpenAI to destroy any content that was trained using its materials.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe paper isn’t the only media company looking to take on OpenAI. The Intercept, Raw Story, and AlterNet are also suing the firm, saying it used their data to train its models. The organizations are seeking damages and calling on OpenAI to delete any training data “from which author, title, copyright, and terms of use information was removed.”\n\nRemoving training data from OpenAI’s large language models could impact their overall performance.\n\nRegulators are circling\n\nOpenAI is also facing regulatory scrutiny in the US and abroad. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the midst of a probe into whether or not OpenAI misled investors. The inquiry followed the OpenAI board’s decision to fire Altman in November, saying he hadn’t been consistently candid with its members. OpenAI rehired Altman less than two weeks after he was removed.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is also looking into OpenAI and its dealings with Microsoft, as well as those of its rivals, as the entity examines the potential impact of major cloud providers investing heavily in generative AI companies. The FTC is looking at Amazon and Google’s investments in OpenAI competitor Anthropic.\n\nOverseas, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is seeking comments from the public with regards to whether OpenAI and Microsoft’s deal should be considered a relevant merger situation and what kind of impact that will have on competition in the market.\n\nThe European Commission, meanwhile, is looking into whether Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship is reviewable under the EU’s Merger Regulation.\n\nCompetition is growing\n\nOpenAI is also staring down increasing competition from some of its biggest rivals. On Monday, Anthropic announced its Claude 3 family of large language models. According to the company, its largest model, Claude 3 Opus, can take on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) is also aiming to take on OpenAI with its Gemini family of models. But the company flubbed the rollout of its Gemini image generator and pulled it off the market pending an update.\n\nApple (AAPL) is also looking to get into the generative AI market, with Tim Cook saying that the company is investing heavily in the technology. And while Apple is unlikely to launch an enterprise generative AI model to directly rival OpenAI’s GPT offerings, it could reveal on-device generative AI capabilities that will draw consumers’ attention away from ChatGPT and its ilk.\n\nBut OpenAI’s challenges aren’t necessarily a sign that the company is in any immediate danger. Lawsuits and regulatory actions can take years to wind their way through the courts if they even get that far. And with Microsoft in its corner, the company has an enormous war chest to pull from to fund its research into larger, more powerful AI models. But with the company sitting at the top of the AI mountain at the moment, it’s sure to face more challenges in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has emerged as a key figure in Reddit’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), holding a significant stake in the social media platform. Altman, known for his leadership at OpenAI and his investments in various technology ventures, controls an 8.7% stake in Reddit, positioning him as the site’s third-largest shareholder. According to The Street, with an IPO valuation of around $5 billion, Altman could make as much as $435 million on the deal.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider shows that many of these shares aren't personally owned by Altman but are beneficially managed through funds, and he only personally owns about $60 million.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250. This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\nReddit’s IPO is set for late March, stirring interest in the tech and investment communities. The platform’s unique position as a hub for online discussions and community building, with 73.1 million daily active users, places it in a competitive landscape with giants like Meta Platforms Inc. and TikTok. Despite the competition, Reddit’s distinct model of subreddits and user engagement offers a different value proposition​​.\n\nAltman’s involvement with Reddit goes beyond a passive investment. He served on Reddit’s board from 2015 to 2022 and had a brief stint as its CEO. The upcoming IPO and Altman’s significant stake have sparked discussions about the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on Reddit, especially given Altman’s background with OpenAI. Speculation around how AI could enhance user experience and content moderation on Reddit is rife, with the expectation that Altman’s expertise could guide the platform’s AI strategy moving forward​​.\n\nTrending: Trending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nReddit’s recent deal with Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google, valued at $60 million a year, to provide content for AI chatbot training adds another layer to the narrative. This partnership could, ironically, indirectly benefit Altman, enhancing the value of his stake in Reddit by creating new revenue streams and potentially increasing the platform’s attractiveness to advertisers and users alike. The deal allows Google to access Reddit’s vast trove of user-generated content, enriching its AI models with diverse and dynamic data. This move underscores the growing importance of AI in shaping the future of social media and content consumption​​.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Reddit prepares for its IPO, the focus on AI, along with Altman’s prominent role as an investor, paints a picture of a tech platform at the crossroads of community building and cutting-edge technology. Investors and tech enthusiasts alike are watching closely to see how Reddit’s public offering unfolds and what it might signal for the broader tech landscape, especially in the realms of social media and AI integration.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.

        "title": "UnitedHealth's cyberattack should be a 'wake-up call' for healthcare",
        "content": "The US Health and Human Services Department (HHS) announced Tuesday it would help doctors and hospitals find alternate claims processing platforms in order to help reboot the flow of business after a cyberattack on a UnitedHealth Group (UNH) subsidiary crippled operations of a large swath of America's health systems for the past two weeks.\n\nThe cyberattack on Feb. 21 paralyzed Change Healthcare, which is used by hospitals, doctors' offices, and pharmacies to process payments and prior authorizations for patient visits and prescriptions.\n\nUnited provided a lengthy status update Tuesday afternoon, including acknowledging that a well-known Russian-backed ransomware group, BlackCat, was responsible for the attack.\n\nThe FBI has known about BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, and was successful in breaching the group at the end of last year, but was not able to shut it down. BlackCat has previously attacked a variety of healthcare entities. It claimed to have obtained up to 6 terabytes of data during the recent attack, and says it received $22 million in bitcoin, a transaction visible on the blockchain, but it is unclear where it came from.\n\nUHG declined to comment on if it paid the ransom.\n\nThe latest data shows 90% of claims are flowing uninterrupted for health providers, and pharmacies should be fully back online by Thursday, UHG said in its statement Tuesday.\n\nIn addition, the company said, \"We’ve made progress in providing workarounds and temporary solutions to bring systems back online in pharmacy, claims and payments.\"\n\nWhile smaller systems that heavily relied on Change Healthcare are struggling, larger systems that have multiple vendors or have the financial resources to be able to quickly pivot to another vendor are less impacted.\n\nBut there are few that can claim not to be impacted at all.\n\n\"This may be the first of its kind, where an outage at the interoperability layer weakens the capacity of the system to function,\" said Aneesh Chopra, former US chief technology officer and currently co-founder and president of CareJourney, a healthcare analytics company.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is a wake-up call on the need for redundancy in systems so we have backup options when a particular vendor goes down,\" he told Yahoo Finance. United Healthcare website displayed on a computer screen in New York on Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (Patrick Sison/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"This incident is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the domestic health care ecosystem and of the urgency of strengthening cybersecurity resiliency across the ecosystem,\" HHS said in a statement.\n\nUHG's stock is down more than 7% in the past month, trading at $473 Tuesday, and it has lost about $30 billion in market cap in the past month.The biggest moves down came a few days after the attack, when it became clear the company was not going to immediately be able to resolve the issues.\n\nThird-party risks\n\nBecause of the regulations to protect patient information, tech platforms have struggled to allow their software to interact with each other and allow seamless connections for health systems.\n\nBut in recent years, newer products have made it easier to achieve interoperability, which is also what makes them more vulnerable to attacks.\n\nUnited's attack makes sense for that reason, experts told Yahoo Finance, because it choked off a key mechanism in the inner workings of the system. Change allows various different entities in the healthcare system to process claims and payments — take for example CVS (CVS) saying 25% of its claims go through Change. That's very different from previous attacks on single entities like hospitals and insurers, which impact only one end of the equation.\n\nUnited is also an appealing target because its Optum brand includes Optum Financial, a different vertical at UHG, which runs a number of payment systems.\n\nOptum Financial, previously Optum Bank, includes the company's affordable housing financing, as well as other processing platforms like Solutran — one of the largest payment processors for the federally funded WIC nutrition assistance program in half of US states, as well as tribal nations and territories. The federal benefits program caters to women, infants, and children and was earmarked for $6.3 billion in the 2024 federal budget proposal.\n\nSolutran also has a grocery benefit product that insurers are utilizing in the increasingly competitive Medicare Advantage and health equity space — another avenue for UHG to handle financial transactions in the health space.\n\nCyberattacks\n\nUHG is far from alone in facing cyberattacks. And despite being a well-resourced company, it faces the same problem that others in the tech and finance sectors face: There is a global shortage of cybersecurity experts.\n\nData shows that there is a shortage of more than 4 million cybersecurity professionals in the global workforce as of 2023, and that represents a 12.6% jump from the prior year. Compounding the problem, there is a hierarchy of where talent goes.\n\nFinance is the top hiring sector for cyber jobs, with technology and healthcare ranking lower.\n\nStephen Gillett, CEO of Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), told Yahoo Finance, that \"some of the most extraordinarily capable security teams I have seen are the big banks on Wall Street.\"\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't those who are willing to work in other sectors, but it shrinks the potential talent pool.\n\nIt's why cyberattacks are a key focus for HHS, which itself has been a target in recent years. It has noted that ransomware attacks are growing to be the most common form of cyberattacks on health systems.\n\nOver the past five years, there has been a 256% increase in large breaches reported to HHS and a 264% increase in ransomware specifically. The agency said in 2023 large breaches affected 134 million individuals, which was a 141% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe attacks happen in all industries, but because healthcare entities are required to report them, they draw criticism for being ill-prepared and under-resourced.\n\nHealth leaders say they are doing everything they can and spending millions to protect against attacks.\n\nJohn Couris, Tampa General Hospital president and CEO, told Yahoo Finance he \"totally disagrees\" with the criticism.\n\nWhen attackers targeted TGH, they were unable to encrypt the data and did not reach the electronic health records — one of the most valuable assets a health system holds. And the issue was traced to a third-party vendor, rather than an internal issue at TGH.\n\n\"What I took away from it is we need to do a more thorough job at vetting some of our third-party vendors,\" Couris said.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

In its blogpost on Monday, it said changes to search results give large intermediaries and aggregators more traffic and less for hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants.\n\nLobbying group eu travel tech which counts Amadeus , Booking.com, Expedia and Airbnb as its members, in turn criticised Google for allegedly continuing to favour its products over rivals despite DMA rules seeking to rectify that.\n\n\"Google continues to self-preference its own intermediation services on the search engine results page.

Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Stocks Rise, Bond Yields Fall as Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap\n\nThe shares trade at “a low multiple for an extraordinary business,” David Cohen, who manages just over $30 billion as a portfolio manager for Boston Partners’ large cap value strategy, said in an interview in London. “We don’t think the upside from what the company can do with AI is priced into the equity.”\n\nAlphabet’s misfiring Gemini AI product has been viewed as a major setback for a firm known for its technological prowess, with the company last month pausing an image generation feature that drew criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. That sparked concerns that one of the world’s most valuable firms over the past decade is falling behind in AI, having been overtaken by Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nCohen said the advantage for Alphabet — whose stock has dropped 5% this year compared with a 13% gain for the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index — is that its share price doesn’t reflect its capabilities in artificial intelligence. He believes the Gemini issues can be fixed relatively easily, and that this presents “a rare opportunity for fund managers looking for a value stock with massive growth potential.”\n\nTypically considered a growth bet and not commonly found in so-called value portfolios, Alphabet was the fourth-biggest holding in Cohen’s Robeco BP US Large Cap Equities fund as of Jan. 31, according to the latest fact sheet. The fund, which also counts JPMorgan Chase & Co., Walmart Inc., and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as its top holdings, has returned nearly 17% in the past year, compared with a 10% gain in the benchmark Russell 1000 Value Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Don’t be quick to dismiss all of Big Tech as pure-play growth stocks,” Cohen said.\n\nOther tech behemoths have surged this year and, as a group, are trading at exalted valuations that are often prohibitive for value fund managers.\n\nAlphabet trades at 18 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about 35% cheaper than that of the broader Magnificent Seven group, which also includes Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc., Tesla Inc. and Amazon.com, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Alphabet shares rose higher on Wednesday.\n\nWhen it comes to Alphabet’s AI missteps, “we think this is a wakeup call for Google executives,” said Cohen. “The technical fix for Gemini doesn’t appear to be costly or particularly difficult. The long-term potential for Google in AI is still extremely strong.”\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\n(Adds stock move in eighth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database Nvidia Is the Latest Shiny Object to Spur Stocks to New Heights\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in March, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. After oscillating between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all climbed to record highs in 2024.\n\nThough there have been select pockets of strength fueling this surge in the broader market, Wall Street's gains primary fall on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have powered the broader market higher\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to seven of the largest and most-influential businesses that have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over an extended stretch. These seven stocks are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAs noted, these stocks have run circles around the S&P 500 for quite some time. MSFT Chart\n\nBut what they've really brought to the table for investors is sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in various aspects of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the world's leading desktop operating system, while Azure accounts for a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spending, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Apple's ongoing innovation has given the iPhone a commanding market share lead among smartphones in the United States. The former largest company in the world also boasts the beefiest share repurchase program on the planet. Nvidia's has become the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for up to a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. Further, Amazon Web Services tops Microsoft's Azure as the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google is a practical monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure provider, and YouTube is the second most-visited social site. Meta Platforms oversees the top social media assets, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Meta's family of apps attracted close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the first automaker to build itself from the ground up to mass-production in over a half-century. It's also the only pure-play EV maker generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven companies could differ greatly. As we motor into March, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain hiding in plain sight, while another highflier is liable to contend with mounting headwinds.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in March: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven long-term outperformers listed above, the most-attractive Magnificent Seven stock for opportunistic investors in March is Alphabet.\n\nIf Alphabet can be faulted for anything, it's being a cyclical company. Last year, 76% of the company's $86.3 billion in net sales were traced back to advertising. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's practically a given that businesses would pare back their ad budgets. At the moment, a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators do signal a high likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, economic cycles aren't even. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, there have been two periods of growth that sustained for longer than a decade. Advertising-driven businesses like Alphabet (and Meta, since we're discussing the Magnificent Seven) are primed for long-term upside as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThere's no question that Alphabet's internet search segment Google is its foundation. A nearly 92% share of worldwide search makes Google the undisputed company businesses are going to seek out for ad placement in order to target consumers. More often than not, Alphabet should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut as I've noted in the past, the Alphabet growth story is about far more than just its dominant internet search engine. Google Cloud has gobbled up about 10% of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its relatively early stages, which suggests this segment can grow by a sustained double-digit pace.\n\nWhat's more, Google Cloud delivered its first year of operating profits in 2023 after multiple years of losses. Cloud services consistently boast higher margins than advertising, which suggests Alphabet's cash flow growth is set to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nYouTube is a beast, too. Daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds), which were introduced in 2021, have catapulted from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to more than 50 billion in early 2023. This should help the company draw in advertisers, as well as boost high-margin subscriptions to YouTube.\n\nLastly, Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. Since Alphabet reinvests a lot of what it generates from its operations, cash flow is the best metric to value the company. Investors can buy Alphabet shares right now for a little over 12 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which is a 31% discount to its trailing-five-year cash flow multiple.

Among the seven most-influential companies driving Wall Street higher over the past year and change, it's semiconductor stock Nvidia that should be avoided like the plague.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has enjoyed ample competitive advantages in the AI arena. GPU scarcity has driven prices of its A100 and H100 chips to the moon, which in turn allowed the company to more than double its sales last year. While Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, the company is set to face headwinds galore.\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest problems is itself. As supply chain issues ease and Nvidia expands production of its A100 and H100 GPUs to meet more demand, scarcity of GPUs will decline. Price-driven scarcity accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's sales gains last year, as evidenced by cost of revenue declining through the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). As Nvidia expands production, it'll likely cannibalize its own margins.\n\nNvidia will also have competition coming at it from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices is stepping up the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel is set to begin fulfilling orders for its Gaudi3 AI-GPU later this year.\n\nThe real concern is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers are also developing AI data center chips of their own. This includes Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, which account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's sales. Not only is it highly unlikely that these four companies will sustain recent purchase activity from Nvidia, but the AI chips they're developing will lessen future reliance on the current AI kingpin.\n\nRegulators aren't doing Nvidia any favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of high-powered AI chips to China. This includes AI GPUs that Nvidia had developed specifically for the world's No. 2 economy after regulators initially clamped down on exports. Regulators could be costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nFollowing the money of company insiders is another reason to avoid Nvidia like the plague. While there have been plenty of sales, there hasn't been a single insider purchase in more than three years. Insiders only buy for one reason: they believe the stock will head higher. If they aren't adding, why should you?\n\nBut maybe the biggest concern for Nvidia and its shareholders is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption of new technology and innovation; and it appears to be happening in real time, once again.\n\nNvidia is valued at close to 34 times its trailing-12-month sales, which is a valuation reminiscent of Cisco Systems during the height of the dot-com bubble. This makes Nvidia an interesting story stock, but one to avoid like the plague for investment purposes in March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Europe's Digital Markets Act is forcing tech giants to make changes. Here's what that will look like",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Europeans scrolling their phones and computers this week will get new choices for default browsers and search engines, where to download iPhone apps and how their personal online data is used.\n\nThey're part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act, a set of European Union regulations that six tech companies classed as “gatekeepers” — Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — will have to start following by midnight Wednesday.\n\nThe DMA is the latest in a series of regulations that Europe has passed as a global leader in reining in the dominance of large tech companies. Tech giants have responded by changing some of their long-held ways of doing business — such as Apple allowing people to install smartphone apps outside of its App Store.\n\nThe new rules have broad but vague goals of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable.\" They are kicking in as efforts around the world to crack down on the tech industry are picking up pace.\n\nHere's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:\n\nWHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES?\n\nSome 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media platforms, will be in the DMA's crosshairs.\n\nThey include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and Android operating system, plus Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari Browser and iOS.\n\nMeta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's Windows and LinkedIn.\n\nThe companies face the threat of hefty fines worth up to 20% of their annual global revenue for repeated violations — which could amount to billions of dollars — or even a breakup of their businesses for “systematic infringements.”\n\nWHAT EFFECT WILL THE RULES HAVE GLOBALLY?\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a fresh milestone for the 27-nation European Union in its longstanding role as a worldwide trendsetter in clamping down on the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bloc has previously hit Google with whopping fines in antitrust cases, rolled out tough rules to clean up social media and is bringing in world-first artificial intelligence regulations.\n\nNow, places like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and India are drawing up their own versions of DMA-like rules aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.\n\n\"We’re seeing copycats around the world already,\" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. The DMA “will become the defacto standard” for digital regulation in the democratic world, he said.\n\nOfficials will be looking to Brussels for guidance, said Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London.\n\n“If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA to avoid fragmentation and the risk of taking a different approach that fails,” he said.\n\nHOW WILL DOWNLOADING APPS CHANGE?\n\nIn one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes installed on its mobile devices.\n\nThe company has long resisted such a move, with a big chunk of its revenue coming from the 30% fee it charges for payments — such as for Disney+ subscriptions — made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that “sideloading” apps will come with added security risks.\n\nNow, Apple is cutting those fees it collects from app developers in Europe that opt to stay within the company’s payment-processing system. But it's adding a 50-euro cent fee for each iOS app installed through third-party app stores, which critics say will deter the many existing free apps — whose developers currently don't pay any fee — from jumping ship.\n\n“Why would they possibly opt into a world where they have to pay a 50 cent per-user fee?” said Avery Gardiner, Spotify's global director of competition policy. “So those alternative app stores will never get traction, because they’ll be missing this huge chunk of apps that would need to be there in order for customers to find the store attractive.\"\n\n“That is utterly at odds with the very purpose of the DMA,” Gardiner added.\n\nBrussels will be closely scrutinizing whether tech companies are complying.\n\nEU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said this week that after 10 years on the job, “I have seen quite a number of antitrust cases and quite a lot of creativity built into how to work around the rules that we have.\"\n\nHOW WILL PEOPLE GET MORE OPTIONS ONLINE?\n\nConsumers won't be forced into default choices for key services.\n\nAndroid users can pick which search engine to use by default, while iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their go-to. Europeans will see choice screens on their devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.\n\nThe idea is to stop people from being nudged into using Apple’s Safari browser or Google’s Search app. But smaller players still worry that they might end up worse off than before.\n\nUsers might just stick with what they recognize because they don't know anything about the other options, said Christian Kroll, CEO of Berlin-based search engine Ecosia.\n\nEcosia has been pushing for Apple and Google to include more information about rival services in the choice screens.\n\n“If people don’t know what the alternatives are, it’s rather unlikely that many of them will select an alternative,” Kroll said. “I’m a big fan of the DMA. I am not sure yet if it will have the results that we’re hoping for.”\n\nHOW WILL INTERNET SEARCHES CHANGE?\n\nSome Google search results will show up differently, because the DMA bans companies from giving preference to their own services.\n\nSo, for example, searches for hotels will now display an extra \"carousel\" of booking sites like Expedia. Meanwhile, the Google Flights button on the search result display will be removed and the site will be listed among the blue links on search result pages.\n\nUsers also will have options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising based on their online activity.\n\nGoogle users are getting the choice to stop data from being shared across the company’s services to help better target them with ads.\n\nMeta is allowing users to separate their Facebook and Instagram accounts so their personal information can't be combined for ad targeting.\n\nThe DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other. Meta, which owns the only two chat apps that fall under the rules, is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can exchange text messages, videos and images.",

        "title": "OpenAI Fires Back at Musk Allegations With Trove of Emails",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI fired back at a lawsuit filed against it by Elon Musk in a blog post Tuesday, using the billionaire’s own emails to show he backed the company’s plans to become a for-profit business and that he insisted it raise “billions” of dollars to be relevant compared with Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised. Tech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets Wrap Gold Climbs to Record on Mix of Fed Pivot and Geopolitical Risks Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge Bitcoin Retreats After Record-Setting Run That Topped $69,000\n\nMusk filed the lawsuit last week against OpenAI, Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, alleging the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible AI and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp., its largest investor. In the post, OpenAI said that Musk was lashing out after trying and failing to make the company part of Tesla Inc.\n\n“We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired — someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,” the company said in the post, which was co-authored by several of OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman, Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.\n\nThe post also reproduced emails Musk had sent to people at the company, demonstrating that the billionaire had endorsed OpenAI’s fundraising efforts. “This needs billions per year immediately or forget it,” Musk wrote in one email, according to OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, as a non-profit, raised less than $45 million from Musk and more than $90 million from other donors, according to the blog post. Musk pushed the company to be far more ambitious in its fundraising, the emails show. At the outset, Altman and Brockman planned to raise $100 million, OpenAI said, but Musk objected, saying the number should be higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe need to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending. I think we should say that we are starting with a $1B funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn't provide.\n\nMusk alleges in his suit that the startup’s close relationship with Microsoft has undermined its original mission of creating open-source technology free from undue corporate influence. “To this day, OpenAI Inc.’s website continues to profess that its charter is to ensure that AGI ‘benefits all of humanity,’” the lawsuit said, referring to artificial general intelligence, a powerful type of AI that doesn’t yet exist. “In reality, however, OpenAI Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.”\n\nAccording to the e-mails in the post, Musk had signed off on the idea that OpenAI wouldn’t build open-source software for artificial general intelligence, and that it would not always share the science behind its technological advances. “As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open,” Sutskever wrote in a 2016 email cited by the startup. “The Open in OpenAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after its built, but it’s totally OK to not share the science,” the email reads. In his response, Musk replied, “Yup.”\n\nIn the blog post, the OpenAI co-founders said that Musk hadn’t always been opposed to corporate influence at OpenAI. They said that Musk had attempted to make OpenAI part of his auto company Tesla, writing in an e-mail: “Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero.”\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and claims of unfair business practices, among other grievances. He is bringing the suit in the capacity of a donor to the nonprofit parent organization as recently as 2019, and is seeking to force the San Francisco-based startup to stop benefitting Microsoft and Altman personally.\n\nAt OpenAI, co-authoring blog post marks a return to public view for Sutskever, the chief scientist and a former board member, who had voted to oust Altman in November but later recanted his decision to help fire him.\n\n(Updates with context from OpenAI’s blog post starting in the first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the most recent trading day at $133.78, moving -0.31% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.02%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 1.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.65%.\n\nThe company's stock has dropped by 7.4% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.72% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.64%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming release. On that day, Alphabet Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.58% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.77 per share and a revenue of $286.48 billion, representing changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.12% increase. Alphabet Inc. presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 19.81 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 26.57.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.24 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 141, this industry ranks in the bottom 45% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Facebook's services are among those affected - Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nUsers of YouTube and Facebook experienced disruption this afternoon, with hundreds of thousands of users reporting problems.\n\nIssues began around 3pm, with the outage affecting Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google. The outages have been tracked by the website Downdetector.\n\nAt 5:19pm, Meta announced that the outage affecting its services was now over. Google told The Telegraph that it “saw a surge in traffic ... and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.”\n\nLondon-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.”\n\nBut the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, which are typically imposed by governments.\n\nAccording to a Google status website, there were also reports of problems with some of its services aimed at advertisers.\n\nIt is understood that the outages were not caused by a cyberattack.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.\n\nIts failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.\n\nLord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.\n\n05:42 PM GMT\n\nGoogle says it has ‘scaled up’ services to combat issues\n\nA Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:\n\nWe saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.\n\n05:37 PM GMT\n\nFacebook says outage over\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:\n\nEarlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nDanske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.\n\nThe stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.\n\nAnalysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”\n\nNovo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.\n\nThe company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.\n\nSales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.\n\nHigh levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc. The injectable drug Ozempic has contributed to Danish economic growth - David J. Phillip/AP\n\n05:17 PM GMT\n\nFootsie closes up\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.08pc today. The biggest riser was Intertek, up 6.15pc, followed by Endeavour Mining, up 4.24pc.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is worth $200bn, $2bn more than Tesla boss Elon Musk\n\n09:31 AM GMT\n\nTesla’s German factory ‘forced to close after arson’\n\nTesla has reportedly been forced to halt production at its German gigafactory after a fire at a nearby pylon which local media speculated was started by environmental activists.\n\nPower was knocked out in the area around the electric car maker’s Gruenheide factory near Berlin, although fire crews said the blaze had not spread to the plant itself.\n\nPolice said the fire brigade was working to put out the fire on the electricity pylon, which is in a nearby field.\n\nA police spokesman said they could not comment on a report by the BZ newspaper which said that the fire was started by environmental activists and that bomb disposal units were called in after emergency services found a sign saying “ordnance buried here”.\n\nIt was also reported by BZ that the fire had brought car production to a halt at the plant.\n\nTesla’s aims to expand its plant, which has a capacity of around 500,000 cars a year, but it has faced opposition from environmental campaigners and local residents, who voted down a motion to fell trees to pave the way for the factory’s growth.\n\nTesla has been contacted for comment.\n\n09:12 AM GMT\n\nMinister tees up ‘responsible’ Budget\n\nThere is just one day to go until Jeremy Hunt unveils his next plans for the economy in his Budget.\n\nA Government minister has said today that a responsible budget would involve a “balance” between giving people “a bit of a tax break this year” and “still keeping a record amount of funding into public services”.\n\nGreg Hands asked that people “judge us on our record” as he declined to say whether cuts to public services would follow the Chancellor’s upcoming announcement.\n\nAsked whether there would be a reduction in funding, the trade minister told Sky News:\n\nJudge us on our record so far. It’s not for me to reveal today what might be in the Budget tomorrow but I would say there’s record numbers of police officers, record numbers of doctors, record numbers of nurses.”\n\nI think a responsible budget will be making sure the country and economy continues to recover from the pandemic, from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the spike in inflation that we’ve had to deal with, and I think that means continuing to put record amount of funding into public services while still giving the British people, I think, a bit of a tax break this year as well.\n\n09:02 AM GMT\n\nGoogle employee accuses head of Israel arm of ‘powering genocide’\n\nGoogle’s head of Israel was accused by an employee of overseeing technology that is “powering genocide” as he was interrupted during a speech at a conference.\n\nBarak Regev, the managing director of Google Israel, stopped speaking as a man identifying himself as a cloud engineer for the US tech giant stood up and criticised its Project Nimbus cloud computing work for the Israeli government and its military.\n\nAnnounced April 2021, the Israeli Finance Ministry said the $1.2bn project is to provide “the government, the defense establishment, and others with an all-encompassing cloud solution.”\n\nCritics have argued the technology allows Israel to collect unlawful data on Palestinians and to increase surveillance.\n\nVideo shared on social media shows Mr Regev addressing the MindTheTech conference in New York before a man stands up and identifies himself as a Google cloud software engineer.\n\nWatch what he shouts below:\n\nA Google Cloud engineer just interrupted Google Israel managing director Barak Regev at Israeli tech industry conference MindTheTech this morning in NY.\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to build technology that powers genocide!\" he yelled, referring to Google's Project Nimbus contract pic.twitter.com/vM9mMFlJRS\n\n— Caroline Haskins (@car0linehaskins) March 4, 2024\n\n08:42 AM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 slumps as China stimulus fails to impress\n\nBritain’s blue-chip stock index fell to a near-three week low as it was dragged down by Ashtead Group and commodity-linked shares.\n\nThe FTSE 100 slipped 0.3pc to touch its lowest level since February 16.\n\nShares of commodity majors such as BP, Shell and Glencore fell about a per cent each as oil and metal prices dipped after investors were unimpressed by pledges by China to transform its economy amid stuttering growth since the pandemic.\n\nAshtead dropped 6.7pc and was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 after the British equipment rental firm forecast full-year group rental revenue at the lower end of 11pc-13pc growth range.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.\n\nShares of Spirent Communications rocketed by 58.7pc after US-based communications equipment firm Viavi Solutions agreed to buy the British company in a deal valued at about £1bn.\n\nInchcape fell 9.3pc to the bottom of the midcap index after the car dealership said it expects “moderated growth” in the short term.\n\n08:17 AM GMT\n\nMirror publisher’s profits tumble after job cuts\n\nThe publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has seen its profits tumble by a third after rolling out sweeping job cuts.\n\nOur reporter James Warrington has the latest:\n\nReach posted a statutory operating profit of £46.1m in 2023, down more than 35pc on the previous year.\n\nThis was largely driven by restructuring charges after the company cut around 800 roles as part of a wider cost-cutting drive. Stripping out the impact of the restructuring, profits fell 9pc to £96.5m.\n\nThe figures cap off a torrid year for the publisher, which is grappling with a sharp downturn in advertising and the impact of social media algorithm changes.\n\nDigital advertising revenues tumbled 15pc, which Reach blamed on wider economic uncertainty and a “material reduction in page views” after Facebook deprioritised news content.\n\nHowever, its shares gained 10.1pc in early trading.

Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.\n\nThere is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.\n\nThis sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.\n\nKey to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless. And it is continually improving the offering.\n\nOverall, the future looks bright for Greggs and 2024 should be another year of progress.\n\n07:30 AM GMT\n\nGreggs reveals record year for profits and new stores\n\nHigh street bakery chain Greggs has cheered a record annual performance as it notched up a 27pc hike in full-year profits, but revealed slowing sales growth.\n\nThe group reported pre-tax profits of £188.3m in 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rose 13.7pc.\n\nIt saw sales growth slow to 9.4pc in the final three months of the year as there was less contribution from price inflation.\n\nThe group added that comparable store sales growth slowed further, to 8.2pc in the first nine weeks of 2024.\n\nBut the company said it was “confident that Greggs can deliver another year of good progress” and remains on track to open between 140 to 160 shops this year after opening a record 220 shops in 2023.

On popular messaging app WeChat, searches for “bitcoin” jumped 12-fold in February.\n\nMia Wang, a finance industry employee based in China’s eastern province of Zhejiang, told Reuters:\n\nI want to buy some bitcoin at a good price and hold.\n\nIt has jumped a lot and is expensive now, but I worry it won’t have any correction.\n\n07:19 AM GMT\n\nBitcoin surge risks creating a bubble, warns JP Morgan\n\nBitcoin’s surge that has taken it close to its record highs could be a bubble, a Wall Street investment bank has warned, as global stock markets also jumped to all-time peaks.\n\nJPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.\n\nBitcoin continued its ascent to a fresh two-year peak of $68,828 that put it within spitting distance of an all-time high.\n\nThere are also signs of wider exuberance across markets, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite all hitting record highs last week - and the Nikkei in Japan surpassing 40,000 for the first time on Monday.\n\nMr Kolanovic said: “Equities have moved up this year, even as bond yields rose and rate cut expectations unwound.\n\n“Investors may be assuming that the increase in yields is reflective of economic acceleration, but earnings projections for 2024 are coming down and the market appears too complacent on the cycle.”\n\nBitcoin has gained 50pc this year and most of the rise has come in the last few weeks after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.\n\nThe so-called spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened the way for new large investors and has reignited enthusiasm and momentum reminiscent of the run up to record levels in 2021.\n\nKyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com, said:\n\nIt’s crypto mania 4.0, and I think if we continue to see fairly low bond and rate volatility, it could keep going.\n\nThere’s definitely something of an irrational behaviour creeping into the market.\n\n07:13 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

        "content": "(Adds international subscribers; no changes to the text.)\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel\n\nMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.\n\nThe plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a \"forced labor\" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the companies \"deliberately obscured\" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.\n\nThe 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.\n\nBut the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to \"participation in a venture\" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.\n\nCircuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.\n\nShe added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.\n\n\"Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,\" Rao wrote. \"We hold that it does not.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTerry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.\n\nThe decision provides \"a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,\" he said. \"We are far from finished seeking accountability.\"\n\nGoogle had no immediate comment. Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.\n\nThe cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show. None was named as a defendant.\n\nThe case is Doe 1 et al v Apple Inc et al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-7135.

Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the companies \"deliberately obscured\" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.\n\nThe 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.\n\nBut the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to \"participation in a venture\" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.\n\nCircuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.\n\nShe added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.\n\n\"Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,\" Rao wrote. \"We hold that it does not.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTerry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.\n\nThe decision provides \"a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,\" he said. \"We are far from finished seeking accountability.\"\n\nGoogle had no immediate comment. Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.\n\nThe cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show. None was named as a defendant.\n\nThe case is Doe 1 et al v Apple Inc et al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-7135.

        "title": "These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Brilliant Buys in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been some of the top performers in the market in recent years. This group consists of some of the largest companies listed in the U.S. markets. They are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOf the seven, I think only four are great buys right now. So, where does the split occur?\n\nI'm not a buyer of these three right now\n\nMicrosoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits.\n\nApple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year.\n\nThese two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.\n\nNvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four.\n\nThese four are much more attractive\n\nThat leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy. For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy.\n\nMeta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point.\n\nLastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.\n\nSome of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough.\n\nBut if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Dell Just Gave Nvidia and AMD Investors Something to Cheer -- and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Investors Something to Perhaps Fear",
        "content": "You don't have to read tea leaves to try to learn about companies' prospects. However, it's not a bad idea to read the transcripts from other companies that operate in the same industry. Sometimes, executives from a competitor, customer, or vendor share things in quarterly updates that provide insight you can't get anywhere else.\n\nDell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) just might have done just that last week. On Feb. 29, the technology company held its quarterly conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter results. During that call, Dell gave Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Computers(NASDAQ: AMD) investors something to cheer. And it perhaps gave Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors something to fear.\n\nSomething to cheer\n\nLike many companies, Dell is enjoying strong tailwinds from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). COO Jeff Clark said in the Q4 conference call that his company saw robust demand for its AI-optimized servers. Clark added that Dell's flagship PowerEdge XE9680 is \"the fastest-ramping solution in company history.\" Overall, orders in Q4 for the company's AI-optimized servers soared by nearly 40% from the previous quarter.\n\nWhy is this something for Nvidia and AMD investors to cheer? Dell's AI-optimized servers use graphics processing units (GPUs) from both Nvidia and AMD. Clark said that the high demand \"was spread across the H100, H800, the H200, and the MI300X.\" The first three of those GPUs are made by Nvidia, while the last one is made by AMD.\n\nClark noted that \"demand continues to outpace GPU supply.\" He stated that there's \"strong interest\" from customers in servers with next-generation AI GPUs such as Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI300X. Importantly, Clark observed that \"most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of the comments from Dell's COO should bring smiles to Nvidia and AMD investors. The picture painted by Clark is one of tremendous current demand for the two chipmaker's GPUs that doesn't appear to be waning.\n\nFew will find any of what Clark said surprising, of course. However, it's good to hear confirmation from an industry leader who isn't associated with Nvidia or AMD. And his comments seem to help justify the massive gains both stocks have delivered so far this year.\n\nSomething to fear?\n\nBut Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors might not like some of Clark's other statements. He seemed to take a deliberate dig at predictions that the cloud is where the future of AI lies.\n\nClark said, \"We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem [on-premises], where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure.\" He pointed out that around 83% of all data is currently stored on-premises.\n\nAccording to Clark's view, more data will be generated at the edge of networks outside of data centers going forward than inside data centers. Because of this, he argued that \"AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created, driven by latency.\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q3 call in October 2023: \"[C]ustomers want to bring the [AI] models to their data, not the other way around.\" That might sound as if he and Clark are on the same page. However, Jassy also stated in Amazon's 2023 Q1 call that he believes that the heavy concentration of IT spending that's currently on-premises will move to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) benefiting from this transition.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed in January 2023, \"The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it.\" He made this statement in the context of discussing Microsoft's cloud platform, boasting that his company had \"the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud.\"\n\nWhat does Alphabet think? CEO Sundar Pichai said in his company's latest quarterly update that AI is \"driving interest and early adoption\" of Google Cloud. This AI boom has been the primary tailwind driving Alphabet stock higher over the last 12 months.\n\nBut if Clark is right that the future of AI is on-premises and not in the cloud, the growth prospects for Amazon, Microsoft, and Google perhaps won't be as strong as their CEOs and investors anticipate. In Dell's vision of what's on the way, local devices could be more important than cloud platforms.\n\nCheers all around\n\nShould Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors be worried? I don't think so. The underlying reasons why organizations continue to move their apps and data to the cloud won't go away. Cloud platforms help lower total costs and provide more flexibility and scalability than on-premises data centers.\n\nThat said, I do think that Clark is probably right that the use of AI on local devices will increase. He's also absolutely correct that customers are only in the early innings of AI deployment.\n\nThere's good news for all of these companies, in my view. Nvidia and AMD should win as the demand for GPUs soars. Dell should win as the demand for AI-optimized servers grows. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet should win as more customers build AI apps on the cloud. Everyone has something to cheer about.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Trigger a Natural Gas Boom in Europe",
        "content": "When the use of seismic surveys became common place, Oil and gas drillers used to drill only in spots the human eye could detect from seismic and other data, but that’s all changing now. The next round of onshore discoveries is being aided by new Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning software that sees what we can’t, forever disrupting the exploration game.\n\nNowhere is this more urgent than in Europe—a continent starved for domestic resources since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the weaponization of Russian natural gas.\n\nMachine Learning software capable of sampling large volumes of 3D seismic, breaking down wave forms to identify unique patterns, and revealing new targets for the drill bit that the human eye has never seen …\n\nThat completely changes exploration.\n\nIt’s been used around the world, and now, it’s being deployed in Austria and Germany by junior explorer MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), the North American company that is the first to offer investors exposure to European natural gas since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMCF saw the value of this technology early on and has used it extensively wherever possible in their search for gas in Europe, according to its CEO, James Hill.\n\nAnd for Germany, in particular, the timing is critical. Critical enough, in fact, that the EU has reclassified natural gas as “Green” and sustainable.\n\nIf Germany fails to sustainably make up for its winding down of Russian natural gas domestically, high-priced LNG imports, delayed nuclear power phaseout and even restarting of dormant coal plants will be the outcome. Renewables cannot yet bridge the gap in the energy transition, and resorting to coal would set things back drastically for the climate.\n\nNatural Gas Paradise Beyond the Human Eye\n\nIn the past, humans only picked prospects to drill visually from the 3D seismic aided by visual hydrocarbon indicators in the data. Now, thanks to new software, they can drill in places they never would have before. AI and Machine Learning sees what we can’t.\n\nStory continues\n\nMCF Energy has both—the power of AI to see beyond the human eye, and prospects with a previously drilled  well that produced gas in Austria, along with two previous discoveries in Germany. MCF has just started drilling at its Welchau prospect in Austria. Welchau is a geologic structure you can see from space and covers about 100 sq km.  An independent evaluation estimated potentially recoverable resources of some 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in an evaluation last year.  A well drilled in the 80’s found producible gas and condensate just south of the location being drilled, confirming the presence of gas in the area.\n\nWhen this 40-day drill is complete, MCF is planning to move the drill rig to Germany, where it will re-open an oil and gas play of over 110 square kilometers in the Lech and East Lech concessions, which have already seen two historical discoveries and three previously drilled wells at Lech.\n\nThey’re not drilling blind, or with limitations of the human eye.\n\n\"The Machine Learning technology that MCF Energy is using allows for the computer to ‘see’ information within seismic data which the human eye cannot. This technology is a game changer and is only now being discovered by other operators,” MCF Energy’s Hill told Oilprice.com recently. Using Paradise software, MCF Energy’s key AI analyst, advisor Deborah Sacrey, has a prediction success rate of over 80% for drilling in areas that are not visual to humans on the data. She has 9 discoveries of this nature to her name, according to the company.\n\nSacrey, a geologist and geophysicist with 45 years of oil and gas exploration experience in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of the U.S., specializes in 2D and 3D seismic interpretation. She’s the only one using Paradise for her clientele, and that’s because she was one of its developers.\n\nParadise software isn’t proprietary, but only a small field of experts have the ability to effectively use it, and MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF) has the advantage of having one of its developers on its advisory board.\n\nThe power of supercomputing has now reached the point of being able to sample data within a 3D seismic volume and break down the wave forms into over 50 “neurons” that each have different attributes of waves. Those “neurons” are then matched up to well information in both dry and producing wells. And comparing this treasure trove of data then yields a unique set of “neurons” that identify gas, oil, porosity and many other factors that control production.\n\nSource: Geoinsights.com\n\nAI scans the entire data set for those unique sets of “neurons” and identifies them on the map.\n\nParadise software, according to Sacrey, analyzes seismic data 15 times more densely than other existing software, and that allows it to distinguish very thin beds of deposition in the subsurface and see thin streaks of porosity that the human eye cannot.\n\nParadise’s Fault Detection uses deep learning and machine learning to automatically detect faults, and generates attributes to extract meaningful geological information.\n\nState-of-the-art color-blending highlights geologic features, such as faults or stratigraphic features, in 3D.\n\nParadise software applies Self-Organizing Map (SOM) unsupervised machine learning to reveal stratigraphic facies and their distributions, and captures facies based on distinctive seismic patterns using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technology.\n\nEstimating volumes of reserves, resources and geologic features, and comparing machine learning classification results and other seismic attributes to traditional well logs should help explorers like MCF get the drill bit in the right place faster, cheaper and much more efficiently.\n\nThis potentially gives MCF Energy a “leg up” when it comes to analyzing the areas to drill and helps to reduce risk in understanding the subsurface.\n\nHow AI Is Changing Exploration & Discovery\n\nThe oil and gas industry is AI’s and Machine Learning’s biggest cheerleader.\n\nThat’s because the disruption these technologies creates and opens opportunities, which could turn into major upside. Forbes calls the changes “profound”, noting that the world’s top 20 oil and gas producers all have major AI strategies for every point along the chain.\n\nMordor Intelligence projected oil and gas spending on AI to close out 2023 at $2.38 billion, and to reach $4.21 billion by the end of 2028.\n\nNew AI announcements come on a near-daily basis.\n\nShell—the biggest producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico--will use AI-based technology from big-data analytics company SparkCognition for deep sea exploration and production—both to pinpoint where to drill and boost offshore production.\n\nAI could shorten exploration to less than nine days from nine months, the two companies said in a statement, with SparkCognition’s Bruce Porter noting that “generative AI for seismic imaging can positively disrupt the exploration process and has broad and far-reaching implications\".\n\nBack in Europe, MCF is doing the same—onshore, and on a continent that desperately needs to secure energy independence from Russia, without creating a secondary dependence on expensive American LNG.\n\nNow, as MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), prepares for its first drill in Germany, it’s armed with a significant AI and Machine Learning advantage for targeting drills in plays abandoned by supermajors decades ago, before Europe realized it couldn’t survive on cheap Russian gas anymore.\n\nMCF’s Lech prospect in Germany came with a modern 3D seismic survey of over 160 square kilometers of 3D seismic data to apply new Paradise Machine Learning technology to. “Using this,” said Hill, “we were able to identify the gas-bearing zones precisely and compare them to the rest of the area. We compared the known gas-bearing area in Lech with the rest of the survey covering Lech East and identified multiple prospects with great potential.”\n\nParadise’s AI – Machine Learning Workbench distinguishes thin beds and Direct Hydrocarbon indicators while identifying and calibrating detailed stratigraphy and automatically detecting faults and revealing fracture trends. It also classifies seismic facies, isolates geobodies and calculates potential oil and gas volumes .\n\nMachine learning allows for the concise ability to reveal the natural gas targets and handle well placement to key zones with porosity and hydrocarbon potential identical to the proven areas, and MCF was one of the first companies to apply it to the entire exploration and development program, according to Hill.\n\n“This proven technique greatly reduces the risk in drilling and helps target the best possible places and depths to drill these wells,” Hill said, adding that it has had a prediction success rate of over 80% when it comes to predicting the geology to identify previously unseen discoveries.\n\nBig Tech is Turning the Oil and Gas Sector on Its Head\n\nGoogle Cloud, a product of Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)\n\nBy Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI, March 4 (Reuters) - A group representing Indian startups has asked the country's antitrust watchdog to order Alphabet Inc's Google to reinstate apps it removed for policy violations, a letter seen by Reuters shows, escalating a showdown with the U.S. giant in a key market.\n\nGoogle on Friday removed more than 100 Indian apps, including popular ones by Matrimony.com, for not complying with its policy of paying a service fee when in-app payment options other than Google's are used.\n\nThe startups have now taken the issue to Competition Commission of India (CCI). The Commission has already spent months looking into startups' complaint that Google is not following a 2022 antitrust directive that prevents it from taking adverse measures against companies which use alternate billing systems. Google denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) in its March 1 letter to the CCI said Google's decision to remove apps was a \"brazen move\" which was anti-competitive and the regulator should ask the company to reverse its decision.\n\nGoogle's move will cause \"irreparable harm to the entire market\", ADIF said in the letter, which is not public.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the letter. ADIF and CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe app removal has sparked criticism from Indian companies, many of which have been at odds with Google for years and criticised its practices. Google, which says it is in compliance, has maintained its in-app fee helps develop and promote the Android and Play Store ecosystem.\n\nThe dispute centres on efforts by some Indian startups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11%-26% on in-app payments, after the country's antitrust authorities ordered it not to enforce an earlier fee of 15%-30%.\n\nIndia's IT minister on Saturday said such removal of apps by Google \"cannot be permitted\".\n\nStartup executives on Monday met India's deputy IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar who told them he was concerned by the removal of the apps and that his ministry will write to Google to ensure they are reinstated, according to two people familiar with the talks.\n\nChandrasekhar later wrote on X that he will take up the matter with Google \"for a sustainable and long-term solution\".

Another cloud provider, Google, has also invested in Anthropic.\n\nAll of the partnerships have attracted scrutiny from U.S. antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission, which is expecting more information later this month in response to compulsory orders it sent the companies.\n\nThe new Claude 3 models come in three versions, all of which have computer vision capabilities that enable them to analyze what's in a photo, chart or graph. But they won't generate new images, avoiding the troubles that forced Google to recently shut down a feature of its Gemini chatbot over how it was depicting race and ethnicity.\n\nThe most advanced and priciest, called Claude 3 Opus, beats OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra in certain multiple-choice tests that are used to measure a chatbot's capabilities, according to Anthropic.",

        "content": "AI models are still a work in progress, and Google’s Gemini is no exception, cofounder Sergey Brin said in a recent video taken at San Francisco’s AGI House. “We definitely messed up on the image generation and I think it was mostly due to not thorough testing and it definitely, for good reasons, upset a lot of people,” he said.\n\nThis was, of course, Brin speaking about Gemini’s recent gaffe in which it produced historically inaccurate pictures, including of racially diverse Nazis, prompting Google to pause the program altogether.\n\nThis is not good. #googlegeminipic.twitter.com/LFjKbSSaG2\n\n— John Lussier (@johnlu0x) February 20, 2024\n\nThe Gemini meltdown prompted a $90 billion selloff in the stock of parent company Alphabet after largely right-wing backlash about the AI model’s error showing a racial bias. The overly “woke” algorithm, users claimed, just kept producing inaccurate, non-white images for prompts such as Adolf Hitler, the pope, and medieval Viking warriors, according to some users. The influential tech blogger Ben Thompson, of Stratechery, was particularly scathing, calling for the resignation of CEO Sundar Pichai because of the rotten culture exposed by Gemini’s “absurd” performance issues.\n\nBrin, the 50-year-old Google cofounder, said he “kind of came out of retirement just because the trajectory of AI is so exciting,” although he cautioned in his appearance at AGI House that much work remains to be done.\n\nHe said the company is still not sure why its AI model “leans left in many cases,” but added that it is not intentional. Brin said that while Gemini’s error was clearly bad, the same could also happen with other large language models.\n\n“If you deeply test any text model out there, whether it’s ours, ChatGPT, Grok, what have you, it’ll say some pretty weird things that are out there that you know definitely feel far left, for example,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nBrin’s words follow Pichai’s stern message to staff, in an internal memo first reported by Semafor, that Gemini’s strange AI images had “shown bias” and were “completely unacceptable.”\n\nBrin said that Google had already made progress in changing Gemini to help avoid similar errors in the future.\n\n“If you try it starting over this last week it should be at least 80% better, of the test cases that we’ve covered,” he said.\n\nStill, Brin admits that criticisms of AI often intersect with politics. He pointed out that while AI models should avoid spreading inaccurate information, the definition of misinformation can vary depending on the person.\n\n“There’s a lot of complicated political issues in terms of what different people consider misinformation versus not,” he said.\n\nDespite the recent stumbles with Gemini, Brin said that he is excited about the future of AI and has even been writing some code, although “it’s not really code that you would be very impressed by,” he joked.\n\nHe said that while training costs are high, he thinks betting on AI is important because of the long-term utility and time savings it could bring to employees across industries.\n\n“If it saves somebody an hour of work over the course of a week, that hour is worth a lot,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nJust as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.\n\nApple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\n\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make its last-ditch argument, according to those reports. Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.\n\nThe stock of Apple was down nearly 3% during morning trading, following the decision by the European Commission.\n\nThe EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nThose practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules. EU Commission vice president Margrethe Vestager addresses the media Monday at EU headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.\n\nThrough provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.\n\n\"Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\" the commission said in a summary of its findings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.\n\n\"The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,\" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services. An Apple store in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,\" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.\n\nApple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get \"limitless access\" to Apple's tools, free of charge.\n\nThe US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\nAny DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A group representing Indian startups has asked the country's antitrust watchdog to order Alphabet Inc's Google to reinstate apps it removed for policy violations, a letter seen by Reuters shows, escalating a showdown with the U.S. giant in a key market.\n\nGoogle on Friday removed more than 100 Indian apps, including popular ones by Matrimony.com, for not complying with its policy of paying a service fee when in-app payment options other than Google's are used.\n\nThe startups have now taken the issue to Competition Commission of India (CCI). The Commission has already spent months looking into startups' complaint that Google is not following a 2022 antitrust directive that prevents it from taking adverse measures against companies which use alternate billing systems. Google denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) in its March 1 letter to the CCI said Google's decision to remove apps was a \"brazen move\" which was anti-competitive and the regulator should ask the company to reverse its decision.\n\nGoogle's move will cause \"irreparable harm to the entire market\", ADIF said in the letter, which is not public.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the letter. ADIF and CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe app removal has sparked criticism from Indian companies, many of which have been at odds with Google for years and criticised its practices. Google, which says it is in compliance, has maintained its in-app fee helps develop and promote the Android and Play Store ecosystem.\n\nThe dispute centres on efforts by some Indian startups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11%-26% on in-app payments, after the country's antitrust authorities ordered it not to enforce an earlier fee of 15%-30%.\n\nIndia's IT minister on Saturday said such removal of apps by Google \"cannot be permitted\".\n\nStartup executives on Monday met India's deputy IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar who told them he was concerned by the removal of the apps and that his ministry will write to Google to ensure they are reinstated, according to two people familiar with the talks.\n\nChandrasekhar later wrote on X that he will take up the matter with Google \"for a sustainable and long-term solution\".\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

        "title": "AI Startup Anthropic Launches New Models for Chatbot Claude",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, one of the sector’s most closely watched companies, is rolling out new software for its chatbot Claude that will be better at carrying out complicated instructions and less prone to making things up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Scraps Premier Li's Briefing, Breaking Years of Convention Wall Street’s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun What to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a Dive Haley Gets First Primary Win in D.C. With Super Tuesday Ahead Young Hong Kongers Who Defied Xi Are Now Partying in China\n\nOn Monday, San Francisco-based Anthropic introduced three new AI models — Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet and Haiku. The literary names hint at the capabilities of each model, with Opus being the most powerful and Haiku the lightest and quickest. Opus and Sonnet are available to developers now, while Haiku will arrive in the coming weeks, the company said on Monday.\n\nChatbots capable of mimicking human conversation have become an increasing focus of Silicon Valley companies — with fast tech advances fueling an investing frenzy. Although chatbots themselves are by no means new, the technology powering Claude and competitors’ bots is a more powerful tool known as a large language model, which is trained on massive swaths of the internet in order to generate text, such as an answer to a question or a poem. Such tools are an application of generative AI, systems that consider input such as a text prompt and use it to output new content.\n\nBut the technology has issues. For example, the chatbots are prone to saying things that aren’t true, an issue sometimes referred to as hallucinations. “These models are still just trained to predict the next word — it’s very, very hard to get to zero percent hallucination rate,” Anthropic President Daniela Amodei said.\n\nIn its latest launch, the company has tried to address the problem, a priority for Anthropic customers, Amodei said. The company said the new versions of Claude software are twice as likely to offer correct answers to questions and less likely to make things up.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnthropic was formed in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, including Daniela Amodei and her brother Dario, who serves as its chief executive officer. The company has since become one of OpenAI’s most formidable competitors, raising billions in venture capital funding. Most of its customers are businesses, ranging from search engine DuckDuckGo to travel guide publisher Lonely Planet.\n\nAnthropic has emphasized developing AI safely and responsibly, which has at times limited its performance. For example, older versions of Claude often refused to respond to queries that were harmless, the company said, because they appeared to the software to be problematic. The new models introduced Monday do this much less often, the company said.\n\n“The science of controlling the training of AI systems remains imperfect — it’s getting better every day but it remains imperfect,” Dario Amodei said.\n\nIn an effort to help users feel that they can trust the results they get from Claude, the latest versions of the software will soon start citing sentences in reference materials to back up the responses they generate, the company said.\n\nThe new models will be able to analyze images, a feature Bloomberg previously reported the company had been working on. That technology enables the programs to perform tasks like identifying the breed of a dog in a photo, comparing two pictures of T-shirts or describing a piece of art — something that Alphabet Inc.’s Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT already offer.\n\nThe company is opting against adding the ability to generate images, as OpenAI and Google’s chatbots can. Dario Amodei said Anthropic customers aren’t clamoring for such a feature.\n\nIn a move that the CEO admitted is “very Silicon Valley-centric,” the company tested the new models’ abilities to recall specific bits of text placed in lengthy documents with the use of a set of essays written by Paul Graham, who co-founded startup accelerator Y Combinator — a training practice that other startups have said they have done, too.\n\nThe company’s middle-tier model, Sonnet, is now powering the publicly available version of Claude online. People who pay for a Claude Pro subscription can use the most powerful version, Opus.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By Jeffrey Dastin\n\nMarch 4 (Reuters) - Anthropic, a startup backed by Google and Amazon.com, on Monday revealed a suite of artificial intelligence models known as Claude 3, the latest salvo in Silicon Valley's near incessant contest to market still-more powerful technology.\n\nAccording to the startup, the most capable in the family, Claude 3 Opus, outperforms rival models GPT-4 from OpenAI and Gemini 1.0 Ultra from Google on various benchmark exams.\n\n\"This is the Rolls-Royce of models, at least at this point in time,\" CEO Dario Amodei said in an interview.\n\nAdvances from Anthropic's competitors have already been previewed or are expected, and Reuters was unable to verify the claims independently.\n\nThe news, on the heels of myriad rival announcements and Anthropic's Claude 2 release in July, shows how companies are vying to top charts that rank AI performance, at the same time as business customers are still grappling with how to put such technology to use.\n\nAnthropic's President Daniela Amodei said customers would opt for Claude 3 Opus despite a higher price tag \"if they had a need for the most cognitively complex tasks,\" for instance handling a complicated financial analysis accurately.\n\nAnthropic said it would charge $15 for Claude 3 Opus to take in every 1 million pieces of data known as tokens, and at least five times less for its smaller models to handle the same. By contrast, OpenAI charges $10 for each million tokens entered into its GPT-4 Turbo model.\n\nAnthropic also said Claude 3 is its first \"multimodal\" AI suite. This means, like some other rival models, Anthropic's AI can respond to text queries and to images, for instance analyzing a photo or chart. Popularized by OpenAI's ChatGPT, such \"generative\" AI creates new content on command.\n\nCEO Amodei said Claude 3 would examine, though not produce, images because \"we've seen much less enterprise demand for them.\"\n\nGoogle last month paused image-generation features for its Gemini chatbot after the service flubbed on diversity, like inaccurately depicting 1940s Nazi soldiers as having various racial backgrounds rather than being white.\n\nAnthropic said its Claude 3 models would be available via Amazon and Google's cloud platforms. It also would sell access to them directly, in 159 countries, Anthropic said. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Michael Perry)",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years. You can also directly check the 5 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years.\n\nConsumer markets are dynamic and the introduction of new products represents both opportunity and risk for businesses. Over the past five years, numerous products have faced challenges and ultimately failed to achieve sustainable success in the marketplace. The unprecedented global event, COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted supply chains, altered consumer preferences, and reshaped the competitive landscape, posing formidable challenges for businesses across various industries.\n\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, nearly 90% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, significantly impacting their ability to deliver products effectively. Publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported revenue declines as a result of these disruptions, highlighting the widespread impact on corporate performance.\n\nMoreover, consumer behavior underwent significant changes during the pandemic, with a notable shift towards online shopping and digital consumption. A report by Adobe found that online sales surged by 32% in 2020 compared to the previous year, as consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce channels for their shopping needs. This shift accelerated the adoption of digital products and services while posing challenges for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and physical product-based businesses\n\nIn addition to pandemic-related challenges, businesses launching new products faced intensifying competition and higher consumer expectations in terms of quality, innovation, and value proposition. Nielsen research suggests that consumer trust in brands and products has become increasingly influenced by factors such as sustainability, social responsibility, and transparency.\n\nFrom high-profile tech gadgets to innovative consumer goods, each product faced unique challenges that contributed to the downfall of products launched by many popular companies. For instance, publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced setbacks with products like Google Pixel 4, which failed to impress consumers and critics due to mediocre battery life and lack of innovative features.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, Innovation remains a key driver of competitive advantage in today's business landscape. However, innovation without adequate market research, consumer insights, and risk assessment can lead to costly missteps. By analyzing the root causes of product failures and learning from past mistakes, businesses can refine their innovation processes, enhance product development strategies, and better align offerings with customer needs and preferences.\n\nMoreover, collaboration and partnerships with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, distributors, and industry experts, can provide valuable insights and resources to support product development efforts. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, companies can leverage external expertise and perspectives to identify potential pitfalls and optimize product strategies.\n\nIn an era marked by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and unprecedented global disruptions, businesses must remain agile, adaptable, and customer-centric to navigate the turbulent waters of the modern marketplace. Through a thorough understanding of past failures and a commitment to continuous improvement, businesses can position themselves for sustainable growth and success in the ever-changing business landscape.\n\nLet's move to the list for the 16 failed products in the last 5 years. 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years\n\nMethodology\n\nOur methodology for identifying the 16 failed products in the last 5 years involved conducting thorough research using Business Insider, Inc., 24/7 Wall St, Listverse, The Verge, and Boredpanda. We selected the 16 failed products in the last 5 years on a structured scoring system. Each product received points based on the times it appeared in the research sources. By employing this approach, we created a definitive compilation of the 16 failed products in the last 5 years and ranked them in ascending order of high scores.\n\n16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years\n\n16. LG G8 ThinQ (2019)\n\nScore: 1\n\nLG's flagship smartphone, the G8 ThinQ, boasted innovative features such as Hand ID and Air Motion gestures, aiming to differentiate itself in a crowded market. However, these features failed to resonate with consumers, who perceived them as gimmicky rather than practical. Additionally, the G8 ThinQ's design and specifications failed to stand out against competitors offering similar or superior performance at a lower price point. LG's marketing efforts struggled to effectively communicate the device's value proposition, resulting in lackluster sales and market penetration. The G8 ThinQ's failure led to the challenges of competing in the highly competitive smartphone market without delivering compelling innovation or value to consumers.\n\n15. LG Rollable Smartphone (2021)\n\nScore: 2\n\nLG's rollable smartphone prototype, showcased with much anticipation at CES 2021, generated excitement for its innovative form factor and potential to redefine mobile device design. However, LG's sudden announcement of its decision to exit the smartphone market resulted in the cancellation of the rollable smartphone's commercial production. The rollable smartphone, which was poised to offer users a unique and flexible display experience, garnered praise for its forward-thinking design and engineering. However, LG's strategic pivot away from smartphones raised doubts about the company's commitment to innovation in the mobile industry. The cancellation of the rollable smartphone project disappointed consumers eagerly awaiting its release and underscored the challenges of executing ambitious projects in rapidly evolving markets.\n\n14. Sony Xperia 1 (2019)\n\nScore: 2\n\nSony's Xperia 1 entered the smartphone market with a focus on delivering premium features and a cinematic viewing experience. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to several shortcomings. Despite its high price tag, the Xperia 1 offered lackluster camera performance compared to competitors in the same price range. Additionally, its limited availability through select carriers and retailers restricted its reach to potential buyers. The Xperia 1 also faced criticism for its tall and narrow form factor, which made it less comfortable to hold and operate compared to other smartphones. Despite Sony's reputation for quality and innovation in consumer electronics, the Xperia 1 failed to attract consumers looking for a flagship smartphone with a compelling value proposition, resulting in disappointing sales and market performance making it a failed product.\n\n13. Uber Jump Electric Bikes (2019)\n\nScore: 2\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s ambitious venture into electric bike-sharing aimed to offer users a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, the service encountered numerous challenges that hindered its success. Regulatory issues, including permitting requirements and restrictions on where bikes could be parked, varied across different cities, leading to operational complexities and limited availability in certain areas. Moreover, vandalism and theft of Jump bikes posed significant financial burdens for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), requiring constant maintenance and replacement efforts. Operational challenges such as battery management and bike redistribution further strained the viability of the service. Despite initial enthusiasm for electric bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s struggles with Jump bikes showed the complexities of implementing urban mobility initiatives amidst regulatory hurdles and operational challenges.\n\n12. Google Pixel 4 (2019)\n\nScore: 3\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Pixel 4 flagship smartphone failed to meet expectations set by its predecessors, facing criticism for several shortcomings. Despite Google's reputation for innovative software, the Pixel 4 disappointed users and critics alike with its underwhelming battery life, which struggled to last through a full day of use. Additionally, the device lacked groundbreaking features to differentiate itself from competitors in the crowded smartphone market. The Pixel 4's high price tag, coupled with its lackluster hardware specifications relative to its competitors, deterred potential buyers seeking value for money. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s decision to omit a fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition technology received mixed reviews, with some users expressing concerns about its reliability and security. The Pixel 4's lackluster reception underscored the challenges of competing in the fiercely competitive smartphone market without delivering significant innovation or value proposition to consumers.\n\n11. Nintendo Labo (2018-2019)\n\nScore: 3\n\nNintendo Labo was an innovative concept that combined do-it-yourself cardboard accessories with interactive gaming experiences for the Nintendo Switch console. Launched with multiple kits offering various gameplay possibilities, Nintendo Labo initially generated excitement among gamers and families. However, the novelty of the cardboard construction and limited replay value led to waning interest after the initial launch period. Despite offering unique gaming experiences, Nintendo Labo failed to maintain momentum due to its high price point relative to its perceived value. The lack of ongoing support and updates for new Labo kits further limited its appeal and contributed to its decline in popularity. While Nintendo Labo showcased Nintendo's creativity and commitment to innovation, its failure to sustain interest laid the foundation of the challenges of introducing new gaming concepts into a competitive market without addressing fundamental user needs and preferences.\n\n10. Segway PT (Personal Transporter) (2001-2020)\n\nScore: 3\n\nMarketed as a revolutionary mode of personal transportation, the Segway PT garnered widespread attention upon its debut. With its self-balancing technology and sleek design, the Segway promised to transform urban commuting and personal mobility. However, its high price tag and niche appeal limited its adoption beyond certain niche markets, such as tourism and security. Additionally, concerns over safety and regulatory restrictions hindered widespread adoption of the Segway PT in urban environments. Despite attempts to diversify its product lineup and target new consumer segments, Segway struggled to overcome its image as a novelty or luxury item. The company's decision to discontinue production of the Segway PT in 2020 marked the end of an era for the iconic personal transporter.\n\n9. Google+ (2011-2019)\n\nScore: 4\n\nGoogle+ was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s ambitious venture into social networking, aiming to challenge Facebook's dominance. Launched with features like Circles for personalized sharing and Hangouts for group video calls, Google+ initially attracted a significant user base. However, it failed to maintain momentum due to complex user interface and integration issues with other Google services. Moreover, the platform's struggle with identity management and the lack of killer features compared to existing social networks hampered its growth. Security breaches, including one in 2018 that exposed users' private data, further undermined trust in the platform. Despite efforts to revitalize it, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the closure of Google+ in 2019, citing low user engagement and the challenge of addressing security concerns.\n\n8. Amazon Echo Loop (2019)\n\nScore: 4\n\nAmazon's Echo Loop represented the company's foray into wearable technology with a smart ring featuring Alexa integration. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to its limited functionality and uncomfortable design. Despite offering basic voice assistant capabilities, the Echo Loop lacked the versatility and utility of other Echo devices, such as smart speakers and displays. Additionally, its bulky and conspicuous design made it impractical for everyday wear, limiting its appeal to consumers seeking a seamless and unobtrusive smart assistant experience. Despite Amazon's marketing efforts, the Echo Loop failed to resonate with consumers, highlighting the challenges of introducing new form factors into the wearable tech market without addressing key user needs and preferences.\n\n7. Google Stadia (2019)\n\nScore: 4\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Stadia aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by offering cloud-based gaming experiences accessible across various devices without the need for high-end hardware. Promising seamless gameplay and instant access to a library of titles, Stadia generated significant excitement upon its announcement. However, the platform faced numerous challenges, including a limited game library at launch and performance issues such as input lag and latency. Furthermore, the subscription model and pricing structure for games on Stadia were confusing for consumers, leading to uncertainty and hesitancy to adopt the platform. Despite Google's investment in infrastructure and partnerships with game developers, Stadia failed to gain widespread adoption and faced criticism from both gamers and industry analysts.\n\n6. Google Clips (2018-2019)\n\nScore: 4\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI-powered camera, Google Clips, aimed to capture candid moments using machine learning algorithms. However, the device failed to gain widespread adoption due to concerns over privacy and limited functionality. Despite Google's efforts to position Clips as a convenient and innovative camera accessory, its reception fell short of expectations. Consumers were apprehensive about the device's always-on recording capabilities, raising privacy concerns in homes and public spaces. Moreover, the device's limited functionality and lack of user control over content creation limited its appeal to consumers seeking more versatile photography solutions. Despite Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s attempt to cater to a niche market segment with Clips, its failure to address fundamental user concerns and deliver compelling features resulted in lackluster sales and market reception.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy 20 Most Carbon Productive Companies in the World Top 15 Electric Bike Brands According to Reddit\n\nDisclosure: none. 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "7 Reasons Why Buying This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Could Be a Brilliant Move Right Now",
        "content": "If you had invested $10,000 in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock when it first began trading in 2004 as Google, you would have more than $550,000 today. I suspect every investor on the planet would love a 55-bagger.\n\nWith Alphabet's market cap now topping $1.7 trillion, the prospects of getting that kind of return over the next two decades are slim. However, I think shares of Google's parent still have a lot of room to run. Here are seven reasons why buying this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could be a brilliant move right now.\n\n1. A business that dominates multiple markets\n\nUltimately, the main reason for any long-term investor to buy any stock is that it has a great underlying business. Alphabet checks off this box and then some.\n\nThe company dominates multiple markets. Google Search ranks as the top search engine by far. YouTube is the No.1 video sharing platform. Chrome is the most widely used browser. Android has the biggest market share in mobile operating systems.\n\nAlphabet also has several other products that might not fully dominate their respective markets but still rank among the leaders.\n\n2. Exceptional financials\n\nThe proof that a business is truly strong is exceptional financial results. Alphabet generated total revenue of nearly $307.4 billion in 2023. It posted a profit of $73.8 billion -- a greater amount than the individual market caps of more than three-fourths of the S&P 500. The company finished last year with a massive cash stockpile of nearly $111 billion. Exceptional? I think so.\n\n3. A huge AI opportunity\n\nOf course, some businesses can still generate strong financial results but have less-than-inspiring growth prospects. That's not the case with Alphabet. One tailwind for the company stands out above all others: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAlphabet has long been a leader in AI development. I don't see that changing. AI should especially drive growth for the company's Google Cloud unit with an accelerated transition of IT spending to the cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is an argument that AI could present an existential threat to Google Search. I disagree. Sure, search engines will evolve and be supplemented by AI virtual assistants. However, my prediction is that Alphabet will adapt successfully to the technology changes.\n\n4. Waymo\n\nOne area of Alphabet's AI focus warrants a special mention. The company's Waymo unit is a leader in developing self-driving car technology. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest projects that robotaxis could generate $9 trillion in sales by 2030.\n\nEven if the amount and timing of that prediction are overly optimistic, I think the robotaxi market will be ginormous. And I think that Waymo will be one of the biggest winners in it.\n\n5. Optionality\n\nThe best stocks to buy are those that have optionality (i.e., multiple paths to growth). Alphabet has more optionality than most. The company is a pioneer in quantum computing, which holds the potential to be a huge market. Its famous \"other bets\" segment includes biotech ventures, smart-home devices, and more.\n\n6. A reasonable valuation\n\nIn many cases, stocks can have great underlying businesses, financials, and growth prospects but still not be good choices for investors because of sky-high valuations. Alphabet, though, has a reasonable valuation -- especially in light of its growth opportunities. Based on a model created by New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran, often referred to as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" Alphabet is the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock right now.\n\n7. It's underestimated\n\nDespite all of its strengths, Alphabet is still underestimated by many people. Some wrote the company off after its public relations stumble with the launch of the Google Bard generative AI app last year. Others point to the company's recent embarrassment of Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures. I think these are merely minor bumps on a long road of growth.\n\nAn \"underdog\" that dominates multiple big markets, is making money hand over fist, has multiple paths to growth, and is reasonably valued? I call that a dog to bet on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 4, 2024 – Zacks Value Investor is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2234701/alphabet-is-on-sale-will-buffett-buy-shares\n\nAlphabet on Sale: Will Warren Buffett Buy Shares?\n\nWelcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\n(0:30) - Should You Buy More of The Magnificent 7? (8:00) - If Warren Buffett Buys Apple, Should You Buy Too? (32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four linchpins of Berkshire Hathaway’s business.\n\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap\n\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple’s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\n\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It’s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\n\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It’s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple’s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\n\nStory continues\n\nCriteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock\n\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\n\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\n\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”\n\nAlphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\n\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\n\nWill Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Adds details, context in paragraphs 5, 7-8)\n\nBANGKOK, March 4 (Reuters) - Thailand's economy is in a \"critical situation\", the prime minister's chief of staff said on Monday, stressing the need for stimulus measures aimed at tackling household debt, boosting tourism and attracting foreign investment.\n\n\"Figures show we are not in good shape,\" Prommin Lertsuridej told reporters.\n\nHis remarks come as Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin's government pushes to revive Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy, which has suffered from weak exports and a slow recovery from the pandemic compared to regional peers.\n\nThe economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and policymakers have downgraded the growth outlook for this year, adding to pressure on the central bank to give in to the prime minister's near-daily demands for an interest rate cut.\n\nSrettha has outlined ambitions to make Thailand a regional hub for several sectors including electric vehicles (EVs), aviation, finance and the digital economy. He has also urged lawmakers to boost Thailand as a food, wellness and tourism hub.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can,\" Prominn said, referring to measures including visa-free tourism and policies to address household debt that is at a ratio of 91% of gross domestic product.\n\nHe also said Thailand must \"improve almost every kind of legal framework\" to make it easier to do business. He added companies like Alphabet Inc's Google and Tesla had\n\nexpressed interest\n\nin investing in the country.\n\nCritics have cautioned that the government's raft of measures - especially a $14 billion 'digital wallet' handout scheme - may not be fiscally viable and could stoke inflation.\n\nPrommin said the government's 3.48 trillion baht ($97.29 billion) budget should be approved and ready to spend by next month.\n\nThe budget has been on hold since October due to a delay last year in forming a government.

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Has 27% of His Third Point Portfolio in 3 Brilliant \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, but Completely Sold Out of Another",
        "content": "Daniel Loeb is something of an iconic figure in the annals of Wall Street. The billionaire is CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb secured his place in investor history by starting Third Point with just $3 million in seed money -- collected from family and friends -- and parlaying that into a $6 billion financial empire. In 2022, Loeb made the list of the \"Best Hedge Fund Managers of All Time.\"\n\nSo when Loeb talks, Wall Street listens.\n\nOver the past year, Loeb's Third Point's holdings have been heavily weighted toward the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The common thread that unites these industry leaders is artificial intelligence (AI). They were also all among the top performers in the Nasdaq Composite last year:\n\nNvidia: up 239%. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): up 194%. Tesla: up 102%. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): up 81%. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): up 58%. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): up 57%. Apple: up 48%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLoeb has made no bones about the onset of generative AI, calling it \"transformative\" and saying \"profound economic upheaval\" coming. \"We believe generative and other forms of AI could compare to the Industrial Revolution but compressed into a period of months and years rather than decades,\" he said.\n\nLet's look at which Magnificent Seven stocks dominated his portfolio in the fourth quarter and which one he sold completely out of.\n\n1. Microsoft: 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft earned its place on Loeb's list thanks to a quick pivot to embrace AI. The company integrated AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its existing products and services. However, the biggest potential opportunity comes from its AI assistant, Copilot, which helps streamline and automate a variety of tasks, significantly enhancing worker productivity. Demand for the product has been robust.\n\nLoeb has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's worth noting that Loeb trimmed his position in Microsoft by more than 9% during the quarter -- but the position is actually larger than when the quarter began. Why? The stock jumped 19% during the fourth quarter, so even as Loeb took a little off the top, the total value of his Microsoft holdings grew.\n\nAt 34 times forward earnings, Microsoft might seem a little pricey, but given its pole position in AI, it's deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Amazon: 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb's stake in Amazon shouldn't be a surprise, as he's held the position for years. In early 2022, when the company's market cap was $1.6 trillion, Loeb stated that he believed there was more than $1 trillion in \"untapped value\" in Amazon. He estimates that its online retail business was worth more than $1 trillion alone, while its cloud infrastructure business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- was worth more than $1.5 trillion.\n\nFurthermore, Loeb has argued that \"the most direct consequence\" of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is that it \"will drive faster revenue growth\" for cloud infrastructure services providers -- including Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. He went on to say that such services \"are the 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit\" no matter who wins the AI revolution.\n\nLoeb trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% during the fourth quarter, but -- as with Microsoft -- the value of the position increased. This was thanks to Amazon's stock price gains of 20% during the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still very much a bargain.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: 6.2% of holdings\n\nIn keeping with Loeb's big bets on the Magnificent Seven and AI, he established a sizable position in Meta Platforms in the third quarter and added again in Q4. Meta's ties to AI are well established, as the company has long used these advanced algorithms to help target its advertising while surfacing relevant content for users on its various social media sites. Furthermore, the recovery of the advertising market is still ongoing, representing additional upside potential for Meta.\n\nThere's also Meta's foray into generative AI with its Large Language Model Meta AI, which is available on all the major cloud platforms. This represents a new source of revenue for the company.\n\nWhile he hasn't explained his reasoning, Loeb obviously believes the stock is still a good value. While not addressing Meta specifically, Loeb's penchant for \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations\" is well documented. Indeed, Meta Platforms stock was selling for 24 times earnings to close out 2023, a discount to the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.\n\n4. Alphabet: 0% of holdings\n\nLoeb closed out of his entire position in Alphabet, selling all 900,000 shares of Class A stock valued at roughly $125 million at the end of the quarter. Loeb has been mum as to his mindset, but broader portfolio shifts might provide some insight. In addition to Alphabet and trimming his Microsoft and Amazon holdings, Loeb significantly reduced his stake in other technology stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intercontinental Exchange, and Uber, among others. At the same time, the billionaire investor initiated positions in several utilities, including Verizon and Vistra, while increasing his stake in Pacific Gas & Electric. This suggests Loeb was rebalancing his portfolio and saw greater opportunities in utility stocks, particularly given the epic run in tech stocks over the past year.\n\nTo be clear, I believe Loeb made a mistake selling out of Alphabet. It stands to benefit from the advertising rebound and the same AI tailwinds that will drive the other Magnificent Seven stocks higher. Furthermore Alphabet is selling at just 24 times earnings, a fair discount to the market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Alphabet Falls From 3rd- to 5th-Largest U.S. Company. Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold the Stock?",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is better known by some of the brands it owns, like Google and YouTube. It's one of the largest tech companies and one of the members of the exclusive trillion-dollar market-cap club. However, thanks to other tech giants posting strong quarters, it has lost its place as the third-largest U.S. company behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia and Amazon have now passed it, although Amazon may fall beneath Alphabet on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSo, is there something wrong with the stock? Let's look at all sides of the analysis, then decide which camp is best.\n\nThe sell case: Alphabet's AI offering may not work out\n\nThe biggest factor in many big tech companies' success right now is artificial intelligence (AI). AI progress and optimism is why Nvidia has shot up so dramatically over the past year, and what propelled Microsoft to pass Apple as the world's largest company.\n\nFrom the start, Alphabet has appeared behind in the AI race. It lost to ChatGPT as the first to launch a usable generative AI product, and to Microsoft's Bing as the first search engine to integrate generative AI. Additionally, its generative AI engine, Gemini, has recently been subjected to bad press, as its image generation feature failed to depict accurate images of prompts.\n\nThe big problem is that if Alphabet's AI model is flawed, or shows a particular bias, it can affect its primary business: advertising. The Gemini model will become the basis of everything Alphabet does, and if it causes issues with Alphabet's advertising model, advertisers may look elsewhere to spend. Considering that 76% of Alphabet's total revenue comes from ads, this would be a big problem.\n\nThe hold case: Alphabet isn't sitting around doing nothing\n\nAlphabet is well aware of the issues with its Gemini model. It apologized for the image generation issue and vowed to improve the platform. Additionally, just because the consumer-facing model does one thing doesn't mean that there isn't a different model being used internally to perform tasks like improving search results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Gemini model still scores better than many competitors in tasks like math and coding, making it a clear choice for many applications.\n\nWhile time will tell what Alphabet does, investors should be assured that the company isn't letting a generational investment opportunity slip by.\n\nThe buy case: Alphabet's stock is far cheaper than its peers\n\nBecause of Alphabet's various problems, there isn't much of a premium attached to the stock. Alphabet is trading for just 21 times earnings estimates, the same as the S&P 500. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nEssentially, the market is valuing Alphabet like an average company. While this assessment may be fair due to its lackluster performance in critical product development, if Alphabet hits its stride, the company will look incredibly undervalued.\n\nAs another side note, if Alphabet fetched the same premium as Microsoft (35 times forward earnings), its market cap would be $2.95 trillion -- making it the second-largest company in the world and only a bit behind Microsoft at $3.05 trillion.\n\nPerception is a big part of how stocks are valued in the market, and market sentiment about Alphabet isn't great right now.\n\nWhat's the verdict?\n\nSo, which viewpoint makes the most sense?\n\nIn my opinion, the stock is a buy. The other big tech firms are expensively priced, and not doing so much better that they warrant those massive premiums. As a result, Alphabet is one of my top tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There’s a growing sense of unease among asset managers that companies with conspicuously small tax bills pose a financial liability too big to ignore.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Becomes Tesla’s Successor as Market Flips From EV to AI What to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a Dive Haley Casts Doubt on Nominee Pledge After Trump’s Power Play BofA’s Subramanian Is Latest on Wall Street to Boost S&P 500 Target Crafts Retailer Joann Is Planning a Bankruptcy Filing That Would Hand Keys to Lenders\n\nFederated Hermes Inc., Robeco Institutional Asset Management, Van Lanschot Kempen NV and Natixis Investment Managers unit Mirova are among asset managers that have been singling out stocks based on their tax history, a process that in some cases has even led to firms being excluded from portfolios.\n\nTax payments that equal less than 15% of profits have become a red flag requiring that — at the very least — the companies’ accounts need to be reviewed, according to investment managers.\n\nIt’s an issue that’s set to grow in importance as governments seek to replenish revenues after the historic wave of emergency spending caused by the pandemic, said Eszter Vitorino, Van Lanschot Kempen’s lead expert for environmental, social and governance advisory. The Dutch money manager has added tax-related risks to a scoring tool used to determine which companies to exclude.\n\n“Companies are sometimes not aware fully, yet, of the risks they’re running,” Vitorino said in an interview.\n\nJoanne Beatty, director at EOS, which is the stewardship arm of Federated Hermes, said she’s on the lookout for “aggressive corporate tax planning.”\n\nFailure to handle taxes appropriately has a range of potential consequences, including lost earnings and a damaged reputation, Beatty said. It’s a clear governance risk, which is why there’s now an increase in shareholder action on the issue, she said.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\n“High effective-tax-rate (ETR) stocks have outperformed low tax-rate stocks since mid-2017, with the decline in the statutory rate to 21% from 35% in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act potentially the catalyst, given it’s benefited high-tax companies. Yet we see close correlation between tax-factor performance and certain industries like energy, which has an elevated link with the tax factor and solid three-year annualized performance.”\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to read more from BI’s Jessica Lin and Christopher Cain\n\nHigh/Low Tax-Rate Stocks Sector Breakdown\n\nThe number of shareholder resolutions singling out tax risks at the world’s largest companies doubled to six in 2023 from the prior year. So far in 2024, four such proposals have already been filed, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute. Companies targeted in the shareholder resolutions include Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips, the data show.\n\nIn a statement to Bloomberg, Exxon said it — along with the oil and gas industry in general — is “subject to some of the highest tax rates in the world.” The company’s “worldwide effective income tax rate, as reported in our Form 10-K, was 33% for 2022,” Exxon said. “We comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, including tax laws, wherever we do business.”\n\nA spokesperson for Chevron said the company “values input from its investors towards the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Any shareholder proposal Chevron receives is evaluated through its well-established governance process. Our approach to tax, as referenced on our website, matches our efforts globally to conduct our business legally, responsibly, and with integrity.”\n\nConocoPhillips said in a statement that it “complies with the tax requirements in every jurisdiction where we operate, including disclosure of tax payment information to tax authorities as required by local laws and regulations.”\n\nFederated Hermes’ EOS, which advises investors holding $1.4 trillion of assets, is currently in talks with 30 companies due to concerns about their tax history. Though Beatty declined to name the companies, she said they span the technology, pharmaceutical, automotive and industrial sectors in Europe and the US.\n\nCompanies exploiting gaps between countries’ tax systems cost governments somewhere between $100 billion and $240 billion of lost annual revenue, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. That’s a key reason why more than 130 countries signed an OECD-backed agreement in 2021 that seeks to enshrine 15% as the minimum global corporate tax rate.\n\nJens Peers, chief investment officer at Mirova US, says he’s now in the process of purging the portfolio he oversees of tax risks.\n\nAs the world coalesces around a 15% minimum global corporate tax rate, “any companies that are below that level” are going to start seeing “an impact potentially on their margins,” Peers said. “And that’s certainly not priced in today.”\n\nRisks identified by Mirova include fines and sudden spikes in tax bills. “So you start making adjustments in the model,” Peers said.\n\nThe OECD framework is comprised of two pillars. The first aims to ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries, while the second introduces 15% as a global minimum rate. The US hasn’t adopted pillar two rules, but American companies operating in jurisdictions that have enacted legislation to adopt the second pillar will be affected by the agreement.\n\nRead More: Double Tax to Coalesce as Details of G-20’s Tax Plan Progress\n\nMichiel van Esch, head of voting at Robeco, said the asset manager has started monitoring “newsflow around disputes with tax authorities,” because they can have a “direct impact” on a company’s profitability.\n\nMirova’s Peers said tax-related concerns are part of the reason why the asset manager doesn’t hold shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. or Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. Paying taxes is one way to show “what companies are actively doing to almost contribute to that social inequality we have today,” he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, and Alphabet didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nLouise Dudley, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes who oversees the firm’s $2.4 billion global equity ESG fund, said some companies are “pushing very much a low-cost approach” from a tax perspective. For these, the OECD framework is going to have a significant impact “and that’s something that’s a bit of a red flag for us,” she said.\n\n“It wouldn’t be a black-and-white decision, but we would look at that alongside other governance factors and other kinds of valuation metrics to see what is the overall risk and upside potential for an individual name,” she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Robotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "To those caught in the still-inflating \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stock bubble, it's a worthy endeavor to remember there are 493 other potential equities to invest in within the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nIndustrials, healthcare, and more are there for the picking!\n\nAnd outside of the S&P 500, there could be great investing opportunities in private equity, Treasurys, and hey, maybe even classic cars, if that's your thing.\n\nPut it all together, and this is what's known as diversification— a tried-and-true wealth-building approach tested by millionaires and billionaires alike, life and business strategist Tony Robbins touted.\n\n\"I would just say maintain diversification. We all heard it a million times,\" Robbins told Yahoo Finance at its New York City headquarters (see video above).\n\nThe six-foot-six author, who recently released \"The Holy Grail of Investing,\" says it's a reminder served up by longtime friend and vaunted investor, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. By diversifying, an investor can better reduce correlations between investments — and bring down the potential risk.\n\nKnown for his ultra-high-energy seminars, Robbins, who has a reported net worth of more than $600 million, warned against the AI hype bubble.\n\n\"I am concerned about it as well,\" Robbins said about investors' infatuation with Magnificent Seven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThe diversification reminder couldn't come at a better time as the Magnificent Seven trade has become hyper-correlated and is mostly moving in a singular direction — up and to the right.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven now makes up some 30% of the S&P 500's market cap, in part powered by a hearty reaction to AI chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report a week ago. Said market reaction has Wall Street analysts tripping over themselves to ratchet up profit forecasts, essentially feeding more upward momentum in the group's stock prices.\n\nStory continues Life and business strategist Tony Robbins (left) reminds investors that diversification is important in an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (right). (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the past three months, Magnificent Seven earnings estimates have been revised higher by a lofty 7%, with its margins going up by 86 basis points, said Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nThe average Magnificent Seven stock is up 14% this year, according to Yahoo Finance calculations. Nvidia has led the way with a 60% advance, while Tesla (TSLA) has dropped 23%.\n\nOver the past year, two of the Magnificent Seven companies have seen triple-digit-percentage gains — Nvidia at 239% and Meta (META) at 184%. The S&P 500 is up a very respectable 29% during that time.\n\nSome on the Street are finally beginning to call a timeout on the Magnificent Seven, with reasonable explanations that a reasonable investor should ponder.\n\n\"Elevated expectations and concentrated positioning create a high bar for the Magnificent 7 to beat,\" strategists at JPMorgan Asset Management contended in a new client note. \"AI will be investable for the long-haul and its beneficiaries will include far more than chipmakers.\"\n\nThey added that a soft economic landing and declining interest rates later this year stand to \"bode well for a catch up\" by sectors and companies left behind in last year's rally.\n\nAn argument could be made that not every Magnificent Seven member delivered blowout fourth quarters and outlooks to justify their stock's near-record valuation. Tony Robbins quote\n\nApple's (AAPL) performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), it missed estimates on ad revenue, the core of its business. Tesla's quarter and its Elon Musk-led earnings call were littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — in the near term — that all its AI efforts are going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta's quarter was okay — but it also jacked up its 2024 capital expenditures a ton, which could weigh on margins and cash flow.\n\nThe quarters out of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia have been universally seen as huge.\n\n\"I've done everything in my life by saying success leaves clues. Find the best in the world. Figure out exactly what they do, do the same thing, and your chances of success go up a hundredfold,\" Robbins said.\n\nThe best investors in the game stay diversified — and not by buying seven tech companies that, at times, compete for the same customers.\n\nGive it a thought.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The tech industry has a long history of providing investors with reliable gains. Since 2019, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has risen more than 135%, far exceeding the S&P 500's 82% growth.\n\nThe innovative nature of tech makes it an ever-expanding space where companies benefit from consistent demand for various hardware and software upgrades. So it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway has dedicated at least 45% of its portfolio to tech stocks. Meanwhile, Berkshire's portfolio posted a nearly 20% compound annual gain from 1965 to 2023 and is now worth $370 billion.\n\nIn 2023, a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) captivated Wall Street. Excitement over the budding market sent numerous tech stocks soaring, with growth unlikely to slow soon. The generative technology can potentially boost countless markets, from consumer products to cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, and more.\n\nThe tech industry has made a lot of millionaires over the years but has plenty of room left to run, with the AI market on its own projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, hitting nearly $2 trillion.\n\nSo here are two top tech stocks that could make you a millionaire.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of brands including Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has become a tech behemoth. The company attracts billions of users to its offerings and has a long history of delivering consistent gains to its investors.\n\nOver the past five years, Alphabet's annual revenue climbed 90% to $307 billion, while operating income rose 135% to $84 billion. And in that period, its stock soared 146%.\n\nAlphabet built a lucrative digital advertising business, which has become its biggest growth catalyst. With more than 80% of the search-engine market and supremacy in online video sharing and smartphone operating systems, the tech company has almost endless opportunities for ad revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Alphabet's most recent quarter, the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue increased by more than 13% year over year, beating expectations by $1 billion. Ad revenue slightly missed expectations in the quarter. However, its AI-focused Google Cloud segment posted revenue growth of 26% to $9 billion. Meanwhile, Google Cloud's operating income reached $864 million, versus the $186 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\n\nThe company's gradual expansion into AI is promising, as it could boost multiple areas of its business. Alphabet could offer more efficient advertising, create a search experience closer to ChatGPT, expand its AI cloud services, and more.\n\nAlphabet is on an exciting growth path, with solid positions in multiple areas of tech. Meanwhile, its free cash flow hit $70 billion last year, indicating it has the funds to keep up with the completion and invest in its business.  AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, Alphabet is trading at a bargain to its competitors. This chart shows Alphabet has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio among some of the most prominent names in tech.\n\nAlongside a lucrative ad business, a growing role in AI, and a range of potent brands, Alphabet is a tech stock that could make you a millionaire over the long term and is worth considering this month.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made a lot of millionaires over the last year, with its stock up 235% since February 2023. However, it appears to only just be getting started, suggesting it's not too late to see major gains from the chipmaker's stock.\n\nNvidia dominated the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for years, significantly ahead of rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The company's supremacy in the industry positioned it to immediately begin supplying its hardware to countless AI-minded companies right at the start of the AI boom last year.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's earnings skyrocketed since the start of 2023, thanks to a spike in chip sales. In Q4 2024, ended in January, the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily owed to a 409% increase in data center revenue as GPU demand soared.\n\nIn addition to increased earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both chipmakers, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $34 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 32 yields a stock price of $1,094.\n\nConsidering its current position, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 39% by fiscal 2027. In addition to a dominating position in a high-growth market like AI, Nvidia is a screaming buy this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks With Rock-Solid Moats to Buy Now",
        "content": "Stocks have roared higher over the past year, and much of that gain is thanks to the \"Magnificent Seven.\" I'm not talking about the Western that hit the silver screen back in 1960 or a newer version that made it to theaters in 2016, though. The seven I'm talking about are a group of industry-leading companies, all developing cutting-edge technology, with names you'll probably recognize: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nAll of these stocks, with the exception of Tesla, have climbed in the double or triple digits over the past year, helping the indexes rise in this new bull market. There are many reasons to like the Magnificent Seven, from their growth track records to their investments in hot technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese players also stand out for their moats, or competitive advantages. A moat is particularly important because, if it's strong enough, it can help a company hold onto its leadership for the long haul -- and that can result in lasting earnings growth. Two Magnificent Seven stocks, in particular, offer rock-solid moats -- which is one of the reasons they should be on your buy list. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet is the company behind a tool you may use daily: the Google search engine. When most of us need to find out about something, our first reflex often is to \"Google\" it. Advertisers know this, and that's exactly why they flock to Alphabet to advertise their goods or services on Google. These advertising dollars make up the lion's share of the company's revenue -- 75% of it in the recent quarter -- and that's likely to continue, thanks to Alphabet's terrific moat.\n\nThe company's competitive advantage in search is that most of us turn to Google Search as part of our daily routine. And this has helped the platform steadily hold a more than 90% share of the search market. This dominance also has reinforced Alphabet's competitive advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's moat may be about to get even stronger because the company is investing in AI, a technology that can make search even better. The company introduced Gemini, its most powerful AI tool ever, late last year and recently launched the next-generation model -- Gemini Ultra.\n\nAlphabet is testing Gemini in search, and the results have been very positive -- making the process faster -- and generative AI is improving search results in many ways. For example, Google can address more complex questions and offer a broader range of links corresponding to your query.\n\nAll of this should keep people coming back to Google for their search needs -- which means advertisers should stick around, too. On top of this, Alphabet has developed AI tools to help advertisers create their campaigns. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai says the company has seen \"a lot of interest\" here.\n\nToday, Alphabet shares trade for 20x forward earnings estimates. This is an absolute steal for a Magnificent Seven stock with such a fantastic moat.\n\nApple\n\nApple may be a word you pronounce every day in your household -- not referring to the fruit but, instead, to the company that makes so many leading consumer products from the iPhone to the Mac. Owners of Apple products tend to stick with them, regardless of price increases or the offerings or rivals. As a result, this technology giant has enormous brand strength.\n\nThis brand strength is Apple's moat, and so far, it's been rock solid over the long term. In the smartphone market, Apple has held a place among leaders, and last year, rose to the top of the rankings with the iPhone. For the first time ever, the company became the world's No. 1 player in the smartphone market, with a 20% market share, according to research firm IDC.\n\nThe total installed base of Apple's devices recently reached a new record high of 2.2 billion worldwide. Not only did the iPhone's active user base reach a record, but Apple announced an all-time high of iPhone upgraders during the quarter -- which shows that users keep returning to Apple.\n\nBut this doesn't mean Apple's growth is limited to current customers. The company also continues to attract new users to its products. For example, in the recent quarter, about half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those particular products -- and two-thirds of Apple Watch customers were first-time buyers. Apple's brand strength helps it hold onto longtime customers and bring in new ones.\n\nThis strength has helped Apple increase earnings in the triple digits over the past decade -- and grow return on invested capital. That means Apple's investments have been wise ones, and the company has benefited from them. AAPL Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nToday, Apple shares trade for 27x forward earnings estimates. This is a very reasonable price for a company that's delivered so much growth over the long term -- and promises more to come, thanks to its rock-solid moat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google's decision to remove some apps in India from its app store \"cannot be permitted\", Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday, amid an ongoing dispute over service fee payments to the U.S. firm.\n\nGoogle on Friday removed from its Play Store many Indian apps, including Matrimony.com's popular Bharat Matrimony and job search app Naukri, saying the companies were not abiding by its in-app payment guidelines.\n\nVaishnaw said he has held talks with Google and will meet the startups, which needed protection in India.\n\n\"This cannot be permitted. This kind of de-listing cannot be permitted,\" he said in a statement.\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nThe removal has sparked criticism from many startups who have for years protested and legally challenged many of the U.S. giant's practices, including its in-app fee. Google says the fees help develop and promote the Android and Play Store ecosystem.\n\nThe dispute centers on efforts by some Indian startups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11%-26% on in-app payments, after the country's antitrust authorities ordered it to not mandatorily enforce an earlier system of charging 15%-30%.\n\nBut Google effectively received the go-ahead to charge the fee or remove apps after two court decisions in January and February, one by the Supreme Court.\n\nGoogle said on Friday that some Indian companies had chosen not to pay for the \"immense value they receive on Google Play\".\n\nAmong the worst hit by the removals is Matrimony.com which has seen more than 150 of its apps dropped from the Play Store.\n\n\"All our apps have been removed and we are out of Play Store and (that) means out of business,\" founder Murugavel Janakiraman told Reuters on Saturday. \"If this continuous for a long term then we will have significant drop in revenue.\"\n\nInfo Edge, another affected company, had seen its job search app Naukri and another real estate search app, removed. Many of the company's app had been restored, its founder said on Saturday on X, without elaborating.\n\nGoogle briefly removed popular Indian payments app Paytm from its Play Store in 2020 citing some policy violations. The move led to the company's founder and the wider startup industry joining together to challenge Google by launching their own app stores and filing legal cases.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dhwani Pandya; Editing by Mike Harrison)",

        "title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Quickly Is Alphabet Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Alphabet's EPS has grown 26% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Alphabet is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.2 percentage points to 29%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future EPS 100% free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Alphabet has a market capitalisation of US$1.7t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$178b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nDoes Alphabet Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nFor growth investors, Alphabet's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Alphabet is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Billionaires David Tepper and George Soros Both Own These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Should You?",
        "content": "Few investors in history have been as successful as David Tepper and George Soros. Tepper's net worth stands close to $20.6 billion. Soros' net worth is roughly $6.7 billion today and was a lot more before he shifted $18 billion to his Open Society Foundation in 2018. Both men's fortunes were built largely as a result of shrewd hedge fund investments through the years.\n\nTepper and Soros have quite different investing styles. They agree on some things, though. Both billionaire investors own these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in their respective hedge funds.\n\nNearly all of the Magnificent Seven are covered\n\nBetween Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Soros Fund Management, nearly all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are covered. The only outlier is Tesla, which neither hedge fund owns. However, there's not much overlap between Tepper's and Soros' portfolios.\n\nTepper has made big bets on tech stocks. Unsurprisingly, he has invested in most of the Magnificent Seven. Meta Platforms ranks as his biggest holding, followed closely by Microsoft. He also still owns a significant position in Nvidia despite selling nearly 23% of his stake in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSoros also owns quite a few tech stocks. But Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia aren't in his Soros Fund Management portfolio. Apple stands alone as the only Magnificent Seven stock that Soros owns that isn't also owned by Tepper.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Two\" in both Tepper's and Soros' portfolios\n\nThat leaves two of the Magnificent Seven that are in both Tepper's and Soros' portfolios. Both billionaires own shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAmazon ranks as the third-largest position for Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund. As of the end of 2023, it held 3.95 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud services company worth close to $600 million. Tepper increased his stake in Amazon by over 5.3% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoros Fund Management isn't nearly as heavily invested in Amazon. At the end of last year, it owned a little under 557,000 shares, valued at $84.6 million. The hedge fund reduced its stake in Amazon during the fourth quarter of 2023 by 27%.\n\nAlphabet was Appaloosa's 10th-biggest holding at year-end. The hedge fund owned 2.3 million shares, worth a little over $324 million. But Tepper sold more than 16% of Appaloosa's stake in Alphabet during the fourth quarter.\n\nSoros' hedge fund also sold some of its position in Alphabet, reducing its stake by roughly 13%. But the stock still ranked as the fourth-largest holding in Soros' portfolio with 1.22 million shares, worth $170 million.\n\nShould you own Alphabet and Amazon, too?\n\nI don't think other investors should buy Alphabet and Amazon just because Tepper and Soros have positions in the stocks. However, when two of the most successful investors on the planet both own the same stocks, it's probably a good idea to pay attention.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon should profit for years to come from the generative AI boom. Organizations across the world will almost certainly continue to shift their IT spending from on-premises to the cloud to develop AI apps.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the top cloud services provider, while Alphabet's Google Cloud is gaining ground. Both of these cloud platforms should grow much larger over the next decade and beyond.\n\nEach of these companies should also benefit from the rising adoption of self-driving cars, especially robotaxis. Alphabet's Waymo unit is a leader in autonomous driving technology. Amazon's Zoox also operates an up-and-coming robotaxi service.\n\nThose are just two big tailwinds for Alphabet and Amazon. I predict that both stocks will make investors a lot of money over the next several years. Those investors will likely include Tepper and Soros, but they could include you, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California regulators on Friday authorized Waymo to expand services of its fleet of robotaxis into Los Angeles and to cities on the peninsula south of San Francisco.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission approved Waymo's application for the expansion of its self-driving taxi operations beyond San Francisco starting Friday. The company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc. has also been operating the service in Phoenix since 2020.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Waymo called the commission's approval a “vote of confidence in our operations, which paves the way for the deployment of our commercial Waymo One service in LA and the SF Peninsula.”\n\nWaymo's cars have become a fairly common sight on the streets of San Francisco, although they are not universally popular and have been known to come to sudden stops that have backed up traffic in the city.\n\nThe expansion for Waymo comes after California authorities revoked the license of a rival robotaxi service owned by General Motors after determining its driverless cars that had been transporting passengers throughout San Francisco were a dangerous menace. A robotaxi run by that company, Cruise, ran over a pedestrian who had been hit by another vehicle driven by a human, and then pinned the pedestrian under one of its tires after coming to a stop.\n\nOfficials in San Mateo County and Los Angeles had opposed the expansion and want more local say over how robotaxis can operate.",

        "content": "(Adds details of ruling)\n\nMarch 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google must face advertisers' proposed class action lawsuit claiming that it monopolizes the ad exchange market, a U.S. judge ruled on Friday.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel dismissed some other antitrust claims, including those focused on ad-buying tools used by large advertisers.\n\nCastel was reviewing a number of cases against Google, and his decision struck down many claims but allowed at least one key set to proceed.\n\nThe advertisers, he wrote, \"have not plausibly alleged antitrust standing in the markets for ad-buying tools used by large advertisers, but they plausibly allege antitrust standing as to injuries they purportedly suffered from anti-competitive practices in the ad-exchange market and the market for small advertisers' buying tools.\"\n\nCastel also said Gannett, the largest U.S. newspaper chain and publisher of USA Today, could try in a separate case to prove that Google fraudulently concealed anticompetitive effects of some technology. Gannett alleged that it sold some of its ad space directly to advertisers, but Google still made the inventory available for auction on its ad exchange in order to accrue transaction fees for its own benefit.\n\nGoogle and Gannett did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe judge also ruled in multiple other cases in the nationwide litigation.\n\nGoogle faces a number of claims on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department sued Google in January 2023, accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising. The government asked for the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager suite, including Google's ad exchange, AdX.\n\nGoogle Ad Manager is a suite of tools including one that allows websites to offer advertising space for sale and an exchange that serves as a marketplace that automatically matches advertisers with those publishers.\n\nAdvertisers and website publishers have complained that Google has not been transparent about where ad dollars go, specifically how much goes to publishers and how much to Google.

That followed an incident in which another Waymo car struck a bicyclist at a city intersection.\n\nWaymo also recalled 444 self-driving vehicles last month after two minor collisions in quick succession in Arizona because a software error could result in them inaccurately predicting the movement of a towed vehicle.

        "title": "Unionized Google workers learned their jobs were over while testifying to City Council about why they need higher pay",
        "content": "Rather than meeting employees at the bargaining table, Google decided to do what could be described as the equivalent of hucking the table into the sky. This week, YouTube Music workers who were recently locked in a tense union fight with Google were laid off while in the middle of testifying before Austin City Council.\n\nthis is the exact moment our coworkers found out we had been laid off while speaking in front of city council pic.twitter.com/IcsCszGe3Z\n\n— jacob (@peepaw_) March 1, 2024\n\nIn a video of the testimony, Jack Benedict spoke of their unionization efforts, explaining that a group of less than 50 was determined to fight two of the largest corporations in the world (Google and its subcontractor Cognizant). During the speech, another employee approaches and says \"They just laid us all off. Our jobs are ended today, effective immediately.” Benedict, visibly shocked, responds “wow,” and they leave the podium as they’re told their time is up.\n\nThis all comes in light of a year-long fight, after a group of 58 employees on the YouTube Music Content Operations Team unanimously voted to unionize as part of the Alphabet Workers Union last spring, in an election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), per a press release by Austin City Council Members. Employes spoke of the need for better pay, benefits, and a more flexible return-to-office policy.\n\nThe news of Google laying off the YouTube Music team broke before the results of an Austin City Council vote on a resolution calling for Google and Cognizant to negotiate with the YouTube Music Content Operations Team. The resolution passed 9-1.\n\n“While workers were at city hall testifying, they received word that their team had been laid off. Instead of getting the chance to stay and celebrate the passage of their resolution they instead needed to leave to go retrieve their personal belongings from their office,” according to an Austin City Council press release. “Many of the workers feel they could lose their homes due to the sudden and unexpected layoff, which some of them believe could be retaliation for standing up today.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dark side of tech\n\nEmployees unionized as part of the larger fight for better pay and benefits and petitioned Google to come to the table for negotiations, but the software company had refused. The company has claimed that because the employees are contractors, Google is not responsible for bargaining; instead, the contractor, Cognizant, is. But the NLRB has said otherwise, ruling Google and Cognizant as joint employers of YouTube Music workers.\n\nThe NLRB has ruled that Google's refusal to bargain with YouTube Music workers is illegal. The board also introduced a new rule this December that would “make it even harder for companies like Google to argue they aren’t responsible for dealing with unionization efforts by third-party contractors,” according to the Verge.\n\nIndeed, in a statement to Fortune, a Google spokesperson says that the Austin-based unionized workers are “not Google employees. Cognizant is responsible for these workers' employment terms, including staffing.” They add that they “have no objections to Cognizant employees electing to form a union. We simply believe it’s only appropriate for Cognizant, as their employer, to engage in collective bargaining,” and say that Google will be appealing the NLRB's ruling that stated otherwise.\n\nGoogle also denied that it fired the YouTube Music workers, saying this was a routine end of contract “which was agreed to with Cognizant.”\n\nAfter this story's publication, a Cognizant spokeperson told Fortune, \"ramp-downs and ramp-ups of projects are a normal part of Cognizant’s business operations. This contract ended at its planned expiration date. \"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the former YouTube Music workers \"will become part of Cognizant’s deployable talent pool, better known as our ‘bench,’ where they are given seven (7) weeks of dedicated, paid time to explore other roles within the organization and build new skills through our training ecosystem. \"\n\nStill, the Alphabet Workers Union said that the contract end had come as a surprise, with no notice to affected workers.\n\nAs a former employee noted, the NLRB has twice ruled that Google and Cognizant are joint employers of these contractors and that Google has illegally changed working conditions without contacting the union.\n\nAlphabet Workers Union directed Fortune to its public statement on the issue, which mentioned how many employees were forced to work multiple gigs to make ends meet and were unable to meet the mandate to work in person as they were “not paid enough to afford the associated expenses with in-person work, like gas and childcare costs.” They also highlighted a quote from the regional director of the NLRB in Fort Worth, Texas, from last year’s ruling that found the contractors were employed by both Alphabet and Cognizant. “Google exercises direct and immediate control over benefits, hours of work, supervision and direction of work,” said the regional director.\n\nAn employee who had worked at YouTube Music for three years opened up about how the tech job was not as cushy as it’s often stereotyped to be. “Truth of the matter is, we get paid $19 an hour here with awful benefits that come out of our paycheck and [we had] a restrictive PTO policy,” they said in an Instagram post. “This is simply not enough to live with any kind of comfortability in this city which is, across the board, significantly increasing its average cost of living year by year.” Adding that the group unionized to change these conditions and pay, the employee notes that the gig was easier when working remotely as they could save money by skipping a commute and making food at home.\n\n“Google and Cognizant have profited immensely off of our labor and consequently -for lack of a better word- fucked us,” says the employee.\n\nUpdate, Mar. 1, 2024: This story has been updated with a response from Cognizant.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is laying off a handful of employees on its trust and safety team as part of broader staff cuts, even as it’s asking members of that group to be on standby over the weekend in order to troubleshoot problematic outputs related to its flagship generative AI tool, Gemini.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Warns of Big Losses From Asset Sales During Property Slump Bankers Sick of the NYC Commute Are Fueling a Boom in a Mini Greenwich Elon Musk Sues OpenAI and Altman for Breaching Firm’s Founding Mission NYCB Flags Weaknesses in Loan Oversight and Names New CEO\n\nThe cuts in the trust and safety solutions group were confirmed by people with knowledge of the decision who asked not to be identified because Google isn’t publicly disclosing details. Fewer than 10 people will be affected, one of the people said, out of a team of about 250. Google’s various trust and safety teams are tasked with setting up guardrails on its AI products, trying to predict how bad actors could manipulate the tools and conducting risk evaluations to ensure the tools are safe for Google’s global user base.\n\nGoogle is increasing its reliance on its trust and safety staff, even if it’s doing so with fewer people. Recently, some employees have been asked to work over the weekend to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further missteps by the tool, according to one of the people familiar with the moves. “We need multiple volunteers on a stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” a Google leader wrote in an email to trust and safety employees. While the cuts won’t impact the group’s members directly working on Gemini, one of the people said, Google’s broader trust and safety team has been managing an overwhelming workload as the company deals with the fallout of Gemini generating ahistorical images of people, another person said.\n\nGoogle framed the job cuts as a move that had been long planned and part of its ongoing belt-tightening efforts. Since mid-January and throughout February, the company has been reorganizing employees across teams, and hasn’t indicated when restructuring would stop. “We’re responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg. “We’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle added that the reorganization to the team affected would help it provide more support for its AI products and would allow the tech giant to eventually add more trust and safety roles at the company.\n\nGooglers working on ensuring the company’s AI tools are safe and accurate — including some members of the trust and safety teams — have struggled with low morale and a feeling of disempowerment over the past year as the company accelerated its pace of rolling out products to keep up with rivals such as OpenAI.\n\nIn an email to staff late on Tuesday, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai acknowledged the company’s increased dependence on the teams, saying employees were “working around the clock” to remedy the problems users had flagged with Gemini’s responses. He added that Google had already seen “a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts” in Gemini as a result.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Gallagher.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family Robotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) reported a stellar performance during the last three months of 2023 as it continues its strategic shift towards the AI landscape. Often dubbed as China’s Google, Baidu’s results showed substantial resilience and even growth amid a complex macroeconomic environment. But being labeled as China’s Google also comes with high expectations, ones that Baidu didn’t succeed to meet with its fourth quarter results as AI spending drained its bottom line. However, while Google and China have the search engine combat, they are also rivals on the AI front in a world where technology transcends borders. When it comes to China, the world’s second biggest economy, Baidu has the home advantage but Google is maneuvering its way back into China through AI software.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended in December, revenue was fueled by gains from its AI applications and expanded advertising business that is Baidu’s bread and butter. Revenue grew 6% YoY to 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion) which was in line with LSEG’s average estimate of 34.97 billion yuan. Online marketing, the business that makes most revenue forChina’s largest internet search engine, reported revenue expanded 6% to 19.2 billion yuan. Adjusted net income rose from 2022’s comparable quarter by 44% to 7.76 billion yuan. But diluted earnings per American depositary share of95 cents were a far cry from the analyst consensus of $2.48 as ambitious AI spending ate into profits.\n\nAI To Combat The Economy Slowdown\n\nLast March, Baidu launched its ChatGPT-like ERNIE Bot in bid to capture the business potential of AI and Ernie is already a contributor to revenues.\n\nBaidu also did a good job at diversifying its revenue sources with non-core businesses that have been contributing to its financial since 2022. But Baidu remains at the forefront of technological evolution as it continues to navigate from being a search engine to becoming an AI powerhouse.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for full year 2023, Baidu reported that revenue rose 9% to about $19 billion but it certainly didn’t help that theU.S. banned the exporting of the most advanced semiconductors to the world’s second-biggest economy. Despite inaccessibility of its cloud computing business, Google is also re-entering the scene by making a pivot towards AI software. Therefore, Google avoided a direct confrontation on the search engine front, but it is undoubtedly laying down the groundwork for a strong AI-powered comeback. The competition between Google and Baidu goes far beyond fighting for market share or technical superiority, as it tells a spectacular global story of transformative power of AI and relentless pursuit of growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Adobe (ADBE) Boosts Gen AI Efforts With Music Generation Tool",
        "content": "Adobe ADBE is bolstering its music generation and editing capabilities on the back of generative AI.\r\n\r\nRecently, the company collaborated with researchers at the University of California and Carnegie Mellon to introduce Project Music GenAI Control, a platform that allows users to generate audio from text descriptions or reference melodies.\r\n\r\nThe tool uses generative AI to assist users in creating and editing music without professional experience. Users can input text descriptions, customize music and remix clips, making it ideal for content creators.\r\n\r\nFurther, the music generation tool enables customization of tempo, intensity, repeating patterns and structure.\r\n\r\nAdobe is expected to gain solid traction across content creators on the back of its latest launch.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nStiff Competition\n\nThe latest move is likely to aid Adobe to strengthen its competitive position against peers like Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT, which are also making concerted efforts to leverage generative AI capabilities for music creation.\r\n\r\nRecently, Alphabet’s Google introduced MusicFX, an enhanced version of its MusicLM tool, aiming to revolutionize the music industry with its superior quality and speed. This generative-AI-powered music generation tool allows users to create 70-second music ditties and loops, with text prompts, suggestions, and a word cloud for instrument and tempo recommendations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Alphabet launched TextFX, a lyrics generation tool, in its AI Test Kitchen, collaborating with Lupe Fiasco to enhance the creative process for lyricists and writers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is enjoying the growing momentum of its text-to-music generative AI model, MusicGen.\r\n\r\nMusicGen generates 15 seconds of audio based on user description, producing up to 120 seconds of clips if hosted on HuggingSpace. It can also recreate user-specified melodies by extracting a melody from a reference audio file.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, partnered with Suno AI to allow its AI chatbot Copilot to create AI songs on demand using the Suno app.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft chatbot users can click on the “Make music with Suno” option to compose original songs based on text prompts using Suno’s Discord tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpanding Generative AI-Backed Offering\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Adobe’s growing efforts to strengthen its generative AI capabilities, which are presently acting as a key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have gained 68% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 50.2%.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Adobe’s launch of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family, enhancing creative control, image quality and illustrator capabilities, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company also launched Photoshop’s web version, which is available via Firefly-powered AI tools, generative expand and generative fill. The editing tool enables file collaboration through sharing links, even without subscriptions and provides a web version with desktop tools like the contextual taskbar for workflow suggestions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these efforts will likely aid this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the global generative AI market. Per a Grand View Research report, the generative AI market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 36.5% between 2024 and 2030.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in the promising generative AI market will, in turn, aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 total revenues stands at $21.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.3%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four lynchpins of Berkshire Hathaway’s business.\n\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap\n\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple’s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\n\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It’s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\n\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It’s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple’s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\n\nCriteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock\n\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\n\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”\n\nAlphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\n\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\n\nWill Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Faces ‘Clear and Present Danger’ of Falling Short in AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The only thing that matters to Alphabet Inc. investors is whether it can get artificial intelligence right.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Warns of Big Losses From Asset Sales During Property Slump NYCB Flags Weaknesses in Loan Oversight and Names New CEO India’s Blowout GDP Based on Data Distortion That Masks Slowdown Fed’s Preferred Inflation Metric Increases by Most in a Year\n\nThat was the message delivered this week as the company’s shares tumbled following news that Google’s flagship AI product was misfiring. The selloff erased $80 billion in market value in a single day, underscoring the importance investors now place on all things AI.\n\nFor a firm with the world’s biggest digital advertising business — its operations generated more than $100 billion in cash last year, with a record chunk of that going back to shareholders — the threat is simple: some other company may develop an AI-powered search engine that, as unlikely as it may seem now, makes Google obsolete.\n\n“Alphabet falling behind in AI is a clear and present danger,” said Tom Graff, chief investment officer at Facet. “The downside is so significant for Alphabet that there’s really no way to price it in.”\n\nSuch a scenario would imperil the nearly $200 billion in revenue Google is expected to generate from search this year — a business that Alphabet rides for the bulk of its profits.\n\nAlphabet has been among the most valuable companies in the world for most of the past decade, primarily because of the dominance of its web advertising business. But it’s been overtaken this year by Nvidia Corp. — whose rise has made it the poster child for the AI mania that has rearranged the stock market.\n\nWhile it still dominates search, and the company is hardly in existential danger, missteps in AI marked a stunning setback for a firm known for its technological prowess — raising the question of whether investors can count on Alphabet to stay at the front of the pack.\n\nMore than a year after the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Alphabet is still struggling to prove that its technology can compete despite spending heavily in the field for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the stock has been sensitive to any sign of strength or weakness on the AI front. The February slump recalled a similar event from last year, when concerns over the accuracy of its Bard chatbot spurred heavy selling, and in December, the well-received release of the company’s Gemini AI model prompted a relief rally.\n\nInvestors are so attuned to the risks of falling behind in AI that they’re turning a blind eye to a stock that is by far the cheapest of the biggest US technology companies at about 19 times profits projected over the next 12 months. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s outlook for revenue and profit growth over the coming year is in a league with Microsoft Corp. and far better than Apple’s, even though the stock trades at big discount to both.\n\nSearch is considered a primary use case for generative AI and chatbots, which means Alphabet’s dominant market share is at risk, while Microsoft — which has been incorporating AI features into Bing — has nowhere to go but up, and this factor has insulated Microsoft shares from its own controversies. So far, Alphabet has maintained its dominance with about 91% of worldwide search share, compared with about 3.4% for Bing, according to Statista data.\n\n“Of course, it has a ‘moat’ in search, but this space is about to be disrupted,” wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who called Alphabet “cheap for a reason.” He added that Alphabet is outflanked by megacap peers in terms of factors like growth, recurring revenue, and margin optimization.\n\nRead More: Google, Microsoft Risk Ongoing Backlash by Deploying Flawed AI\n\nStill, few who follow AI are counting out Alphabet. It has invested in the technology for years and boasts the kind of infrastructure and engineering talent that is seen as needed to put out a competing product.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik wrote that he felt compelled to defend Alphabet, even though he is among the 15% of analysts without a buy rating on the stock.\n\n“Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, Google’s response looks more like a body builder who’s been told his muscles are all show, picking fights and getting beat up,” he wrote. However, “at the point in time when Gen AI answers have gained consumer trust, Google should be best positioned to integrate these results alongside web query results thereby offering consumers the best of both worlds.”\n\nGetting to that point, however, could be lengthy and expensive. “They have the resources and capability to produce something credible, but we don’t know if it will be a major growth driver,” said Philip Lawlor, head of market research at Wilshire Indexes.\n\n“If you don’t have a credible product, then it becomes about survivability.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. shares have extended a surge to hit the latest in a series of fresh records this year. Seen as one of the primary beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, optimism about new AI processors has helped AMD shares recover from a weak forecast.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nElon Musk sued OpenAI and Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, alleging they have breached the artificial intelligence startup’s founding agreement by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity. Dell Technologies Inc. headed for its biggest gain in six months after reporting better-than-expected sales and profit, fueled by demand for information technology equipment to handle artificial intelligence work. Tesla Inc. rolled out a number of incentives to boost sales in China, where it is coming under increased pressure from local rivals such as BYD Co. The top US diplomat in Hong Kong sounded the alarm over growing internet censorship in the city, underscoring fears China’s crackdown on freedoms is diminishing the hub’s appeal as a global finance hub. The US will investigate potential data and cybersecurity risks posed by Chinese electric vehicles and other internet-connected cars, the Commerce Department said Thursday, intending to act before their manufacturers expand into American markets.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family Elon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.78 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.76 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $65.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $286.52 billion and $318.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(29:25) - Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Stocks Using The Earnings (35:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, AAPL, VRT, MSFT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how the Zacks Rank stock ranking system got it right on NVIDIA and the other hot AI and datacenter stocks over the last year. The Rank was signaling something was going on in the datacenter and chip industries as the Rank moved to the highest level, the Strong Buy, last year and has mostly stayed at that level.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer and Vertiv, all three involved in AI and datacenters, remain Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks after their recent earnings reports.\n\nWere you noticing the Rank on these stocks? It was signaling something \"good\" was going on at these companies.\n\nWhat is the Zacks Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Rank is Zacks stock ranking system which ranks stocks into 5 categories with Strong Buys being the top category, and Strong Sells the bottom category. However, most stocks will be ranked in the middle, as Holds.\n\nZacks ranks over 4400 stocks. The top ranked stocks are rare. There are currently just 244 Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions and can change daily. It is just a 1 to 3-month recommendation.\n\nHow to Get a Strong Buy Rank\n\nIn order to get the #1 Strong Buy rank, the analysts have to be in agreement and raising earnings estimates.\n\nWhen a company reports earnings, beats, and then raises guidance, that's the perfect conditions for the company to achieve the top rank. After a beat and raise, the analysts usually end up revising their own estimates higher.\n\nMany AI and datacenter companies have been beating, and raising, for several quarters. The Zacks Rank has been signaling for months that something \"good\" was going on.\n\nHow the Zacks Rank Got It Right on NVIDIA and Other Datacenter Stocks\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA first became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the second quarter of 2023, after it reported earnings and beat and raised.\n\nNVIDIA actually fell to a #2 (Buy) late in 2023 but it jumped back up to a #1 (Strong Buy) again in 2024 after the recent earnings beat and raise. Shares of NVIDIA are up 73% since May 30, 2023, which is a few days after earnings to the present.\n\nNVIDIA analysts are still raising estimates. Fourteen earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2025 in the last week and none have been cut.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about NVIDIA?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer was a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. It also fell to a #2 (Buy) during that period before busting out to #1 (Strong Buy) rank again in the third quarter of 2023, after earnings.\n\nZacks only has 3 analyst estimates on Super Micro Computer for the full year, as it's not as highly followed on the Street as NVIDIA.\n\nBut those analysts are still bullish. 2 estimates have been revised higher on Super Micro Computer in the last month for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Super Micro Computer?\n\n3. Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT\n\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, has been beating and raising every quarter for the last year. Vertiv became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the same time as NVIDIA, in the second quarter of 2023. It has briefly fallen to a #2 (Buy) stock but has now reclaimed the Strong Buy rank.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Vertiv as well. 2 earnings estimates have been revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025. Even though it's a large cap company, Zacks has just 3 estimates on the company for both years. It is not heavily covered on the Street.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Vertiv?\n\nWhat Does the Zacks Rank Signal About Mega Cap AI?\n\n4. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL\n\nAlphabet has not been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the fourth quarter of 2021. It was briefly a #2 (Buy) in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAlphabet is currently a Zacks #3 (Hold), which is where most stocks end up. The analysts are mixed on Alphabet for 2024. 10 estimates were raised for the full year in the last 30 days, but 7 were also cut during that time.\n\nIs the stock reflecting the uncertainty in Alphabet's earnings outlook?\n\n5. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\n\nMicrosoft hasn't been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the first quarter of 2020. It has, however, recently been a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. It was a Buy stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. It remains a #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Microsoft for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. 17 earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 in the last 30 days, with no analyst estimate cuts.\n\nWith all that bullishness, why isn't Microsoft a #1 (Strong Buy) instead of a #2?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Using the Zacks Rank?\n\nTune into this week's podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT, MSFT and GOOGL in her own personal portfolio. SMCI is in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio and VRT is in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Google is facing heavy backlash over accusations that the company is \"woke\" following the revelation that its new artificial intelligence tool, Gemini, was developed with a bias against White people.\n\nThe Alphabet-owned tech giant is scrambling to right ship after pulling the plug on Gemini's image generation features last week, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling employees on Tuesday the company is working \"around the clock\" to fix the tool's bias, calling the images generated by the model \"completely unacceptable.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai\n\nHowever, \"Public\" founder Michael Schellenberger says the fallout over Gemini is Google's \"Bud Light moment,\" likening the situation to what Anheuser-Busch InBev faced after its Bud Light brand was boycotted following a partnership with controversial transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\n\"The problem for Google, as with Bud Light before it, is that its CEO and other senior executives are still in denial about the problem,\" Schellenberger told FOX Business in an emailed statement. \"They think the problem is just a few tweaks to the AI or the algorithms.\"\n\nBUD LIGHT REMAINS DRAG ON PARENT COMPANY AS DYLAN MULVANEY HIT LINGERS\n\nThe journalist and author argues it will take more than fixing Gemini for Google to regain the public's trust.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Gemini's senior director of product management at Google has issued an apology after the AI refused to provide images of White people.\n\n\"The real problem is that Google is a tool of its woke workers and government contractors, who are manipulating Google Search and Google Gemini to divide the American people along racial and partisan lines, censor disfavored views, and spread disinformation about everyone from German farmers to American investigative reporters,\" Schellenberger wrote.\n\n\"Google’s CEO must snap out of denial and commit to political neutrality, which means nonpartisan and balanced political donations, nonpartisan and transparent fact-checking that is accountable for its biases and errors, and an end to censorship of politically disfavored views,\" he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGLE CEO'S 2016 PLEDGE TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION WITH AI UNDER SCRUTINY FOLLOWING GEMINI CONTROVERSY\n\nJessica Melugin, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Technology and Innovation, says she does not believe Google's troubles rise to the same level as Bud Light's.\n\n\"I think they’re different in that Bud Light was a marketing mistake, while Gemini was a product mistake,\" Melugin told FOX Business. \"I think the parallel would be skunked beer.\"\n\nMelugin said she can see how some might see a common thread in terms of political slant, but noted that generative AI competitors have produced bad results in the other direction too, so she thinks Gemini's woes could be attributed to a quality-control issue.\n\n\"Whatever the reason for the bad results, Google has plenty of incentive to fix it,\" she said, pointing to the beating Alphabet's stock has taken since hitting pause on Gemini.\n\nOriginal article source:Is the Gemini fallout a 'Bud Light moment' for Google?",

        "title": "Is Apple the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" are some of the most dominant businesses in the world. As a result, their shares, which have soared in price in recent times, are in many investors' portfolios.\n\nAt its current market cap of $2.8 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) doesn't need an introduction. The maker of popular hardware and software products is a financially lucrative enterprise. And its stock has climbed 316% in the last five years, crushing the returns of the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nApple is also Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far. But is it the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now?\n\nLow growth, high price\n\nApple isn't putting up growth numbers like it used to. Revenue increased by 2.1% in its fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, but dropped in each of the four previous quarters. On average, Wall Street analysts expect sales to rise at an annualized clip of 4.2% over the next three fiscal years.\n\nThat's hardly any reason to get excited. In fact, it puts Apple dead last when compared to the other Magnificent Seven businesses. The other six are forecast to post much faster top-line growth, according to consensus analyst estimates.\n\nBlame it on macro headwinds or consumers no longer feeling the need to upgrade to the newest Apple device as often. But investors are probably smart not to expect double-digit percentage revenue gains from Apple anymore.\n\nHowever, the stock trades as if strong growth is a foregone conclusion. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.2 is a huge premium compared to its trailing-10-year average of 21. This is a stock that's best kept on the watch list for now, in my opinion.\n\nDigital ad giants\n\nOf all the Magnificent Seven stocks, I believe two stand out as the best to buy right now. I'm talking about the giants in the digital ad market: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nGrowth isn't a concern for these internet enterprises. Alphabet reported revenue of $307 billion in 2023, up 8.7%, while Meta's sales climbed 15.7% to $135 billion. Because the global digital advertising industry has many years of expansion ahead, these two businesses are poised to remain major beneficiaries. Combined, they command nearly 60% of the worldwide digital advertising market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that both Alphabet and Meta possess powerful competitive advantages, the most notable of which are their network effects. Alphabet's Google Search and YouTube are incredibly popular internet services that get better with more information, content, and users, as are Meta's various social media apps -- a situation that makes things extremely difficult for their smaller rivals.\n\nIn the last five years, Alphabet and Meta have averaged operating margins of 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively. Plus, they both produce ridiculous amounts of operating cash flow, giving them the financial resources to invest aggressively in artificial intelligence capabilities, while at the same time repurchasing a lot of their outstanding shares.\n\nInvestors are being asked to pay forward P/E multiples of just 20.3 for Alphabet and 24.1 for Meta. By that metric, they are the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, which makes them no-brainer investments in my book.\n\nWhile Apple is surely one of the highest-quality companies in the world, its current setup doesn't position it favorably to deliver market-beating long-term returns. Based on their attractive business characteristics and compelling valuations, Alphabet and Meta are the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 AI Stocks With 29% or More Upside, According to These Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is exploding, and the $208 billion global market for AI is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Statista. That's a lot of wealth creation coming down the pike. Investors looking for wealth-building stocks would be wise to check out the leaders of this emerging opportunity.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are two leading tech stocks that Wall Street is increasingly bullish on. Shares of AMD and Alphabet are up 126% and 57%, respectively, over the last year, trouncing the 40% return of the Nasdaq Composite. Stocks that outperform coming out of a market correction like the one in 2022 can be forward indicators of which companies are likely to outperform in the new bull market.\n\nHere's why these two stocks are poised for market-beating gains from these highs.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAnalysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets recently raised their price target on Advanced Micro Devices stock to $270, representing a 52% upside over the current share price of $178. AMD is well-positioned to jump into the data center AI GPU market this year with its new MI300x chips.\n\nAMD is seeing strong momentum in its data center business as it ramps up new products. In the fourth quarter, it said revenue grew 38% year over year, and it's just getting started. AMD sees the market for this hardware growing to approximately $400 billion by 2027.\n\n\"We have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multiyear AI hardware and software road maps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio,\" CEO Lisa Su said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in late January.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD continues to deepen its relationship with Microsoft to develop the next generation of AI-powered PCs in the consumer space. AMD says its Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of the AI PCs on the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe momentum in data center GPUs and AI PCs shows AMD well positioned to deliver returns to shareholders over the next decade. The stock is richly valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, but this reflects Wall Street's expectation for earnings to double over the next three years to $7.17.\n\nThe company will have to report impressive growth to hit the analyst's target this year, but regardless of how it performs in the near term, I believe AMD is a great stock to hold for the long haul.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAnalysts at Wolfe Research recently raised their price target on Alphabet to $180, representing an upside of 29% over the current share price. The parent company of Google is seeing early signs of positive returns from its AI tools, which could lead to substantial growth in its advertising revenue.\n\nAdvertising is a cyclical business that can swing with the health of the broader economy. The company's ad revenue slumped in 2022 over macroeconomic headwinds, but as the economy warms up again, ad revenue is firming up. Google's ad revenue grew 11% year over year in the fourth quarter, and AI is already looking like a catalyst for more growth.\n\nThe company recently unveiled version 1.5 of its Gemini AI model. Google is using Gemini to help advertisers accelerate the creation of ad campaigns in Search. It is also serving as the brains behind Bard, a search tool powered by generative AI.\n\nAlphabet is also seeing strong growth in its subscription offering Google One, which offers cloud storage and access to other Google products. It is looking to bring more AI features to users that could expand its already sizable subscriber base of over 100 million.\n\nOf course, AI also plays a vital role in the Google Cloud enterprise business, which is just starting to turn a more consistent profit after years of losing money. As you can see, AI is foundational to the whole business, which is why Wolfe Research is right to be bullish on the stock's prospects.\n\nThe consensus analyst estimate has Alphabet reaching earnings of $8.85 by 2026. The stock is trading at a reasonable forward P/E of 21, which could justify the stock hitting the analyst's price target this year, with more gains to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy in 2024, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts -- No, It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "Analysts at BMO Capital see Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) as the company best positioned to benefit from the growing demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The firm reasons that Alphabet has a big head start on most peers because its Google subsidiary has been integrating machine learning into core products for more than two decades.\n\nAdditionally, analysts at JPMorgan Chase have also selected Alphabet as a top pick in 2024, due in part to the recent launch of machine learning model Gemini. The firm believes Gemini will narrow the generative AI technology gap between Alphabet and OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThat information may surprise some readers, given that Nvidia is often considered the gold standard among AI stocks. But a little research reveals an interesting pattern. Opinions regarding the best AI investments vary widely among Wall Street analysts, so investors should put very little confidence in such speculation. Instead, owning a basket of AI stocks is the most prudent strategy.\n\nHere's why Alphabet deserves a place in such a basket.\n\nAlphabet finished the year with strong fourth-quarter results\n\nAlphabet reported fourth-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 13% to $86.3 billion, a sequential acceleration driven by particularly strong momentum in Google Cloud and YouTube subscriptions. The only blemish was that Google Advertising revenue narrowly missed expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings soared 56% to $1.64 per diluted share due to stock buybacks and the company's ongoing focus on expense management. On that topic, CFO Ruth Porat outlined plans to further improve operating efficiency by prioritizing key product development opportunities, simplifying organizational structure, and slowing the pace of hiring. The chart below provides more detail on fourth-quarter revenue growth across Alphabet's four primary business segments.\n\nStory continues The fourth-quarter revenue in Alphabet's four primary business segments. Hedging gains revenue was excluded because it accounts for less than 1% of total revenue. Chart by author.\n\nGoogle is a leader in digital advertising\n\nCentral to the investment thesis for Alphabet is leadership in digital advertising. Its Google subsidiary is the largest adtech company in the world, accounting for 28% of digital advertising revenue last year, according to Insider Intelligence.\n\nThat strong market presence is due to its ownership of popular platforms like Google Search, YouTube, Android, and Chrome. In fact, Google has 15 products that each serve at least 500 million users, all of which let the company collect data that helps advertisers run more effective campaigns.\n\nGoogle is using artificial intelligence (AI) to make its advertising ecosystem more attractive to internet users and advertisers. The company is still tweaking its Search Generative Experience, which brings generative AI to Google Search to \"serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions,\" according to CEO Sundar Pichai. Google has also added a chat-based interface (powered by generative AI) to its adtech software to help advertisers build more relevant campaigns with less effort.\n\nGoogle lost about 150 basis points of market share in digital advertising over the last two years, and the company is projected to lose another 120 basis points in the next two years, according to Insider Intelligence. But AI innovations could reduce or even reverse that trend.\n\nGoogle is slowly gaining market share in cloud computing\n\nGoogle Cloud is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) after Amazon and Microsoft. To be clear, Google is a distant third, but its strength in data analytics and strategic product development is helping the company gain share. Google accounted for 11% of CIPS spending in the fourth quarter, up from 10% one year earlier and 9% two years earlier.\n\nThe company is laser-focused on expanding its AI capabilities to maintain that momentum. Most notably, Google recently introduced Gemini, a multimodal model that \"surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks,\" according to the company. Gemini is now the power source behind Search Generative Experience and the conversational elements of its adtech software, but Google Cloud customers can also use Gemini to build custom generative AI applications that span text, image, video, audio, and code.\n\nAdditionally, Gemini can automate tasks across Google Workspace, a suite of office productivity software. That includes drafting text in Google Docs, creating images in Google Slides, and organizing data in Google Sheets. Those capabilities keep Google on par with Microsoft, which has a generative AI assistant called Microsoft 365 Copilot that automates similar tasks across applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.\n\nCollectively, those AI products (in combination with future innovation) could help Google gain share in cloud computing and office productivity software, though the company certainly faces tough competition from its big tech peers.\n\nAlphabet shares trade at a reasonable valuation\n\nGoing forward, digital ad spending is forecasted to increase at 7% annually through 2028, and cloud services spending is projected to grow at 11% annually during the same period, according to Statista. That gives Alphabet a good shot at high-single-digit or low-double-digit sales growth. Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales at 9.9% annually over the next five years.\n\nThat consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 5.8 times sales look reasonable, and the current multiple is a nice discount to the three-year average of 6.3 times sales. At that price, investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in Alphabet stock today, remembering that a basket of AI stocks is the most prudent way to benefit from AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

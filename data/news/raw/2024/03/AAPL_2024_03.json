You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 is consistently recording gains this year, having risen for four months in a row. According to Bank of America’s chief global strategist Michael Hartnett, the remarkable returns achieved by the S&P 500 over a short time period have been rare and only occurred ten times since the 1930s. He further said that these returns materialized either during the aftermath of the recession, like the ones in 2009 and 2020, or at the onset of a bubble, similar to the situation experienced in 1999. That said, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which played a significant role in driving the market rally in 2023, has entered the oversold territory this year. The stock is down by 7.63% year-to-date, facing pressures due to concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors are trying to navigate this directionless market, seeking to maximize their returns by making informed decisions. Over the years, dividend stocks have served as a safeguard against market downturns, making them an appealing option in the current environment. When considering investments in dividend stocks, combining dividend yields with dividend growth can be a good strategy. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which analyzed the performance of the S&P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats. The index tracks the performance of high-yield dividend companies within the S&P 500 Composite 1500 with at least 20 consecutive years of dividend growth. The report revealed that between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the index outperformed its benchmark index by 140 basis points per month. During this period, the index also surpassed the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur research also showed that dividend stocks have performed better than other asset classes during inflationary periods. We cited data from Hartford Funds, examining the performance of dividend stocks during decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s when inflation in the US was at its peak. The report highlighted that during these decades the average market returns were below 10%, and dividends contributed 67%, 44%, and 73% to the market’s returns, respectively. One of the main reasons for this performance of dividend stocks can be attributed to the fact that they have the potential to grow over time. The companies that generate more profit may opt to increase their dividends, remaining more committed to their shareholder obligation. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard, returning their capital to shareholders consistently for years.\n\nThat said, dividend stocks’ past performance does not guarantee immunity against severe market conditions. During market clampdowns, investors' confidence may decline which triggers widespread selling across various stocks resulting in some becoming oversold. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), introduced by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978, is a technical analysis tool that is used to analyze the speed and change of price movements of a stock. The RSI is calculated based on the average gains and losses over a specific period, typically 14 trading days. However, this period can be adjusted depending on the trader's preference. In this article, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks based on 14-day RSI levels as of March 30. 12 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and looked for dividend stocks with a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 40 as of March 30. An RSI below 40 suggests that the stock is oversold. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their RSI. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023.

        "title": "Apple's antitrust fight could threaten its search for the next big thing",
        "content": "The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL) could have major consequences for the iPhone maker’s business segments. If the DOJ wins, the company could be forced to give third-party companies greater access to iPhone features including Apple Wallet, improve compatibility with competing devices, and even allow third-party app stores on iOS.\n\nBut the DOJ will have a difficult time proving that Apple has broken antitrust laws, and even if it does prevail to some degree, the company will likely appeal the case all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the end, Apple may make some concessions, but the DOJ’s suit is unlikely to significantly uproot the company’s overall business. But that wouldn’t mean Apple is out of the woods. The antitrust action could hold greater dangers for the company than giving users access to different app stores or ending the green-versus-blue text bubble debate.\n\nIt could ultimately hurt the company’s ability to capture the next wave of tech innovation, just as Microsoft’s (MSFT) antitrust suit in the late 1990s gobbled up executives’ resources and cost that company its chance to dominate the smartphone market.\n\nA distraction at the worst time\n\nThe tech industry is in the throes of a massive upheaval thanks to the generative AI explosion. Microsoft, which has invested heavily in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, is now the wealthiest public company in the world by market cap, pushing Apple to second place.\n\nNvidia is riding an incredible wave of success with revenue skyrocketing on sales of its AI chips, and seemingly every company in Silicon Valley and beyond is talking about how it’s implementing generative AI to one degree or another. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates attends a session at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos on Jan. 17, 2024. (FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) (FABRICE COFFRINI via Getty Images)\n\nApple is widely expected to dive into the arena with the debut of its own generative AI capabilities at its WWDC developer conference in June. That’s not all, though. Apple is also working through the continued development and support of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset, which it hopes will serve as a new form of computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut antitrust suits are long, time-consuming affairs that can eat up executives’ time, pulling them away from important business decisions.\n\n“If the company believes that virtual reality is the next generation of computing after the smartphone … they really need to focus at the C-suite on that,” explained Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. “But this case is enough to really substitute their time away from focusing on the future. So that's one risk.”\n\nThere’s some precedent for this line of thinking. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates famously blamed the distraction caused by his company’s antitrust battle with the DOJ for its failure to break into, and capture, the smartphone market. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2001, opening up Windows to competing web browsers and services.\n\nMicrosoft eventually launched its own Windows Phone, even going as far as acquiring Nokia for $7.2 billion, but it failed to catch on and the company decided to focus on its cloud business instead.\n\nDeepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster says that while he doesn’t believe the antitrust case will prove to be a major distraction for Apple’s ability to innovate, it’s certainly a threat.\n\n“If [Apple doesn’t] innovate then they're going to lose and it's not about the DOJ; the DOJ would have been the distraction factor,” he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nApple’s brand damage\n\nA protracted legal battle could also damage Apple’s carefully crafted public image.\n\n“The question is, how far and how hard is Apple [going to] fight some of this stuff, and in the process, do they risk … hurting the tremendous goodwill that they have?” said TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “I think that's something that they need to think about.” Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple has built up a powerful following around the world thanks to its top-notch hardware quality, easy-to-use software, and customer service. But a lengthy legal fight and negative headlines could jeopardize that.\n\nYes, Apple is one of the world’s largest electronics companies with a growing services business. And sure, the iPhone is one of the most iconic devices ever built, but consumer sentiment can change overnight, and that could certainly prove problematic for Apple.\n\nThe DOJ’s antitrust suit is still in its earliest stages, and Apple is sure to fight it as aggressively as possible. And while it’s weathered major storms before, including regulatory fights in the European Union, there’s no guarantee the company will come away from this battle unscathed.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Spring Cleaning: 3 Stocks to Say Goodbye to Right Now",
        "content": "Spring is here, and flowers are blooming. You know what that means: Time for a good old-fashioned round of spring cleaning.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three stocks that a panel of Motley Fool contributors are ready to say goodbye to this spring. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill the rise of AI mean the beginning of the end for Apple?\n\nJake Lerch (Apple): Now, don't get me wrong, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed a great run. It's the second-largest public company in the world for a reason, and I don't think its stock price is about to collapse.\n\nYet however impressive its past performance, what matters to investors is how the company will perform going forward. And that's where I have concerns for Apple.\n\nTo start with, sales of the company's signature product -- the iPhone -- appear to have leveled off after years of growth. In 2023, Apple sold 231 million iPhones -- virtually identical to the number it sold in 2015. Moreover, iPhone revenue appears to have gone flat. The figure last year was $201 billion. That's down from $205 billion in 2022.\n\nYear iPhone Unit Sales iPhone Revenue 2015 231.2 million $155 billion 2016 211.8 million $136.8 billion 2017 216.7 million $141.2 billion 2018 217.7 million $166.2 billion 2019 187.2 million $142.3 billion 2020 196.9 million $137.3 billion 2021 242 million $191.9 billion 2022 232.2 million $205.4 billion 2023 231.3 million $200.5 billion\n\nBut what about Apple services? Won't the company's growing software division lead to its next phase of growth?\n\nPerhaps. Apple's services segment does now account for almost 20% of the company's total revenue. However, software has never been Apple's bread and butter. Indeed, its long-standing policy of bundling its software and hardware has dampened its growth -- dating all the way back to the 1980s, when the company wouldn't license the Mac operating system to other computer makers.\n\nWhat's more, the real question is whether Apple can compete over the long term with companies that have created iconic software, social media, and web apps -- Microsoft (Windows and Office), Alphabet (Google), MetaPlatforms (Facebook), and Amazon (Amazon.com).\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) raises another question for Apple: What happens to the smartphone business as the use of AI systems keeps expanding? Will anyone want to pay $1,000-plus for a smartphone if everything from TVs to cars to wearables to thermostats is enabled with AI-powered features?\n\nIn short, Apple is at a crossroads. And while I certainly wouldn't bet against the company, I do think investors can find many alternatives with fewer question marks right now -- think Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. And that's why Apple is on my spring cleaning list.\n\nHaving \"AI\" in its name may not be enough to save this stock\n\nWill Healy(C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) looks like a stock to buy rather than avoid. Given the popularity of generative AI stocks in recent months and the enterprise software company's ability to attract high-profile clients such as the U.S. Army and Baker Hughes, it seems like it should be on a long-term uptrend.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, investors will see serious issues. Though it is successfully attracting enterprise AI clients, the company's strategy appears excessively tied to tech trends. It went by names such as C3 Energy and C3 IoT before it went public in 2020. Those frequent name changes may make investors wonder how committed the company is to its focus on AI.\n\nSecondly, based on its finances, there's some question about whether it can ever become profitable. For the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, C3.ai reported revenue of $224 million, up 15% versus the same period in fiscal 2023. (Its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 31.)\n\nUnfortunately, its operating expenses (which do not include its $127 million cost of revenue for the period) amounted to $363 million. Consequently, its net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 came to $207 million.\n\nWorse, C3.ai is not showing any signs it can grow its way out of this problem. For fiscal 2024, it forecasts revenue between $306 million and $310 million, which would amount to a 15% increase at the midpoint.\n\nAs a result, the stock has struggled. It had more than doubled in value at one point last year before a dramatic pullback. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 10%, significantly lagging the S&P 500.\n\nFurthermore, it trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11. That multiple arguably makes C3.ai an expensive stock, particularly considering its financial struggles.\n\nUltimately, investors have numerous choices when it comes to investing in AI. Given the state of its finances, investors should probably consider selling C3.ai and putting their money into a faster-growing AI company that's on a path to sustained profitability.\n\nDon't let greed ruin your stellar investment returns\n\nJustin Pope (Super Micro Computer): I've been bullish about SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI) in the past, and I still like the company over the long term. But Super Micro Computer has risen too high, too fast this year. Shares are more than 1,000% above their 52-week low -- a level of return that the broader market would likely take decades to produce.\n\nIf you're sitting on a multibagger today, considering selling some of your stake would be wise. That doesn't mean there isn't much to like about Supermicro. Its modular server systems are in high demand due to the booming investments in artificial intelligence across the technology sector. The company's growth has accelerated to a triple-digit percentage rate, and management believes revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year in the next quarter.\n\nBut stocks can be volatile, and the broader market has been running hot. The Nasdaq Composite index is up a smoldering 38% over the past year. Eventually, a pullback could pour cold water on share prices, and investors may start locking in some profits from their big winners. Has any stock run as high as Super Micro Computer? It would be hard to find one that has.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell everything and run for the hills. However, greed can be a powerful emotion that works against investors. If you're sitting on huge gains, consider taking some profits. You can always look to reinvest when the market inevitably cools off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "You don't buy growth stocks primarily to receive income. Many of these stocks don't pay dividends at all. However, that doesn't mean you can't earn dividend income from growth stocks.\n\nThe biggest growth stocks on the planet right now are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Can you count on sitting back and having dividends pour in with these stocks? Yes -- at least with some of them. Here's how much dividend income you'd make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nA dividend divide\n\nThere's a clear \"dividend divide\" among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Although they all arguably make enough money to pay dividends, only four actually do so.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) initiated its dividend program in 2003. Since then, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) technically began paying quarterly dividends decades ago. However, the company ended its dividend program in 1995 and didn't resume distributing dividends until 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple has consistently increased its dividend payout.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most surprising dividend stock in the Magnificent Seven. The big chipmaker first declared a quarterly dividend in 2012. Nvidia increased its dividend regularly for several years but has maintained a steady payout since late 2019.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the newest Magnificent Seven dividend payer. The social media company initiated its dividend program earlier in 2024.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Tesla don't currently offer dividends. That could change in the future for two of the three, though. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that Amazon and Alphabet could begin paying dividends, perhaps as soon as this year.\n\nCounting the money\n\nSo how much dividend income could you make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks? If you bought $10,000 of each stock, the total would be just under $170. The following table breaks down how much in dividends each stock would contribute:\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $71.00 Apple 0.56% $56.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $41.00 Nvidia 0.018% $1.80 Amazon N/A $0.00 Alphabet N/A $0.00 Tesla N/A $0.00 Total $169.80\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nOf course, if you were truly seeking dividend income you probably wouldn't buy shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. Let's crunch the numbers assuming you invested $70,000 split equally across the four dividend payers in the Magnificent Seven ($17,500 in each stock). The following table shows how much you'd make:\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $124.25 Apple 0.56% $98.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $71.75 Nvidia 0.018% $3.15 Total $297.15\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nWould most income investors be happy with an annual dividend income of less than $300 from an initial investment of $70,000? Probably not.\n\nLimited magnificence\n\nThe magnificence of the Magnificent Seven stocks is limited. None of them offer attractive dividends. The best dividend payer in the group, Microsoft, still has a dividend yield of barely over half of the yield of the S&P 500.\n\nDividends are an afterthought if you're investing in the Magnificent Seven. Buy these stocks for their growth prospects. Many other stocks are more magnificent if you want solid dividend income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Safe to Buy Stocks With the S&amp;P 500 at a Record High? Warren Buffett's Advice Could Save Investors From Costly Mistakes",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 31% over the past year as investors became more confident in a soft landing, a scenario in which the Federal Reserve successfully tames inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. The index currently sits within a percentage point of its record high, but upward momentum has stretched valuations across the stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 20.9 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the five-year average of 19 times forward earnings, and a substantial premium to the 10-year average of 17.7 times forward earnings. Not surprisingly, some analysts on Wall Street think stocks are due for a correction. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have set the S&P 500 with year-end targets of 4,200 and 4,500, respectively, implying a downside of 19% and 14% from its current level.\n\nThose forecasts leave investors with a tough decision. Is it safe to buy stocks with the S&P 500 near its record high? Or is the stock market best avoided until valuations come down? Anyone looking for answers might want to take their cue from Warren Buffett.\n\nWhat investors can learn from Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filings\n\nCEO Warren Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) equity securities portfolio, while deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handle the remainder. Investors can track the stocks the trio buys and sells each quarter by reviewing the Form 13Fs the company files with the SEC.\n\nThe latest filing indicates that Berkshire sold several stocks during the fourth quarter. The company closed its positions in Markel, Globe Life, D.R. Horton, and StoneCo, substantially reduced its positions in Paramount Global and HP, and trimmed its stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). However, Berkshire also bought stocks during the fourth quarter. The company added to its positions in Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Chevron.\n\nCollectively, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks last year. The company reported more than $40 billion in equity securities sales compared to just $16 billion in purchases. That marks a turnaround from the previous year when Berkshire reported $33 billion in equity securities sales and $68 billion in purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, Buffett and his deputies continued to buy stocks throughout 2023 despite rising valuations, but they also moved more cautiously. Investors should follow that example.\n\nThe Warren Buffett blueprint for investing success\n\nOver the years, Warren Buffett has dropped bits of investing advice like breadcrumbs during interviews, editorials, and shareholder letters. In synthesizing that information, the prevalent theme is that Buffett likes to buy understandable businesses that benefit from a durable economic moat, but only when shares trade at attractive prices relative to intrinsic value.\n\nEconomic moats come in different shapes and sizes, but they generally amount to pricing power or cost advantages. For instance, Apple derives pricing power from the brand authority it has built with consumers. Nvidia has pricing power in the superior nature of its artificial intelligence chips. And Visa benefits from cost advantages arising from the size of its payments network. However, an economic moat alone does not qualify a business as a good investment. Investors must also consider its valuation.\n\nBuffett once explained the concept of intrinsic value by quoting economist John Burr Williams: \"The value of any stock, bond, or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows -- discounted at an appropriate interest rate -- that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset.\" That quote refers to discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts future earnings back to their present value to estimate what a company is worth.\n\nHow the discounted cash flow calculation works\n\nThe discounted cash flow (DCF) formula looks intimidating on paper. But online calculators can crunch the numbers, so investors only need to familiarize themselves with the inputs. Learning by example is the best strategy. Shown below is a DCF calculation for Apple using this calculator.\n\nCurrent value: The trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) or free cash flow (FCF) per share. I used earnings per share of $6.42 over the last 12 months. Discount rate: The return required to make the investment worthwhile. I used the historical return of the S&P 500, which is approximately 10% annually. Some investors prefer the weighted average cost of capital. Growth rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate over a defined period of time. I used the consensus forecast among Wall Street analysts, which says Apple will grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years. Growth over: The length of time the growth rate will persist. As mentioned, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 8.3% annually over the next five years. Terminal rate: The anticipated earnings growth rate after the explicit forecast period. This number should align with inflation, but should not exceed gross domestic product growth. Investors typically select a value between 2% and 4%, so I split the difference with 3%. Terminal rate over: The length of time the terminal rate will persist. Investors often assume terminal growth will continue indefinitely, but I used 50 years.\n\nBased on those inputs, Apple is currently worth $115 per share. That means the stock is about 32% overvalued at its current price of $169 per share. However, investors should remember DCF models involve guesswork, and even small changes to the inputs can have a drastic impact on the output.\n\nIt's safe to buy stocks, but the market environment warrants caution\n\nTo summarize, the S&P 500 moved much higher over the past year, and the index currently trades at a material premium to its historical valuation. Even so, Buffett continued to buy stocks throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. But he also showed more caution compared to the previous year, indicating that worthwhile investments were harder to find.\n\nIn that context, investors can safely purchase stocks in the current market, provided they show similar caution. That means avoiding costly mistakes driven by fear of missing out, and instead limiting purchases to competitively advantaged businesses trading at reasonable valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was \"extraordinary.\" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't \"know if it's beneficial.\"\n\nWhatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.\n\nThat could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.\n\nAmazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBuffett also owns shares of Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.\n\n5. NXP Semiconductors\n\nNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.\n\nAI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.\n\n6. Qualcomm\n\nThrough NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.\n\nQualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.\n\n7. IBM\n\nBerkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM(NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.\n\nIBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.\n\n8. Alphabet\n\nBuffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.\n\nAlphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.\n\nAre these Buffett AI stocks good picks to buy now?\n\nI think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Are Nike, Lululemon, Apple, Tesla, and Starbucks Waving a Red Flag for the Stock Market?",
        "content": "So far, the stock market is having a great 2024, at least when measured by the performance of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up over 9.5% year to date. However, if you dig a little deeper, you see that there is a divergence forming.\n\nHere's why the S&P 500 could keep going up despite this challenge, and how these changing market dynamics could impact your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nConsumer-facing companies are vulnerable\n\nThere are plenty of ways to categorize companies. You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap. But one often overlooked difference between companies is whether they mainly sell to consumers or businesses. For example, Nvidia and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are both big tech stocks. But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.\n\nSome -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.\n\nThe industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.\n\nJustifying a premium price\n\nMany companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has brought the cost of its cars down, but there are still more affordable options. And Apple charges top dollar for its devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll five of these companies are instantly recognizable brands and industry leaders. But all five stocks have been struggling. Starbucks and Nike are within 5% of their 52-week lows. And all five companies have lost considerable value in 2024 compared to strong gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. SBUX Chart\n\nDespite being in different industries, the challenges of these companies are actually quite similar.\n\nDemand problems\n\nNike has been cutting inventory so it is less exposed to slowing consumer demand. Lululemon delivered blowout results, but guidance was light due to a challenging consumer environment that includes concerns about the economy and diverting spending toward services and experiences over goods. Since reporting earnings on March 21, Nike stock is down over 8% and Lululemon is down over 19%.\n\nStarbucks has exhibited impressive pricing power that has offset inflationary impacts and has led to record sales. But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.\n\nApple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China.\n\nTesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model. Earnings are projected to be lower in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months, signaling that Telsa is in store for negative growth over the short term.\n\nA buying opportunity for patient investors\n\nDifferent sectors tend to outperform or underperform the S&P 500 based on the business cycle, valuation, investor sentiment, and other factors. What makes 2024 unique is that many sectors are doing well, but there are major industry-leading companies that tell a completely different story.\n\nThe broader market can keep going up even if consumer-facing companies remain challenged, because businesses are doing well and could accelerate growth if interest rates fall later in the year.\n\nIn most cases, if an industry leader is underperforming it's because it has high exposure to consumer spending and/or China. The investment thesis for Apple, Tesla, Nike, Lululemon, and Starbucks hasn't really changed. Instead, all five stocks are underperforming because these companies don't have the qualities that are driving the widespread rally (artificial intelligence and rising corporate profits from business-to-business sales).\n\nInvestors who think consumers and China will recover over time are getting the chance to buy many great companies on sale. Just be ready for more volatility, and the risk that the narrative could get worse before it gets better.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 industries with the highest number of quits in the US. We have also discussed the great resignation and turnover expectations for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US.\n\nThe Great Resignation, characterized by a massive increase in job quits, appears to be drawing to a close, marking the end of a tumultuous period in the workforce. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of workers have left their jobs, with astonishing numbers quitting in 2021 and 2022. Anthony Klotz, who coined the term 'Great Resignation,' notes that resignation rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels according to May 2023 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicating a normalization of the job market.\n\nEconomists attribute the decline in resignations to various factors, including economic instability and improved working conditions. The current economic uncertainty has made workers more cautious about quitting, leading to a slowdown in resignation rates. Additionally, many individuals who made significant career changes during the pandemic have settled into new roles, contributing to the decline in quits. Job satisfaction is reportedly at its highest level in nearly four decades, reflecting improved workplace conditions and employer efforts to retain talent.\n\nDespite the overall decline in resignations, certain industries continue to experience high turnover rates, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and construction. While economists declare the Great Resignation officially over, they acknowledge that certain sectors may still struggle to find and retain workers.  Currently, healthcare and hospitality are two of the industries in the US that have the biggest labor shortages.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that employers are bracing for increased turnover in the first half of 2024, as revealed by a recent study from Eagle Hill, signaling a potential increase in departures due to faltering confidence in leadership and overall workplace satisfaction. The survey was conducted nationally and pointed to a nearly 6-point decline in worker confidence regarding organizational stability and leadership, coupled with a 2.7-point drop in satisfaction with cultural elements such as connection and recognition. Despite these concerning trends, there's a glimmer of hope as workers exhibit confidence in pay-related matters, with perceptions of compensation and future growth expectations rebounding by 2.5 points in the last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, as highlighted by iCIMS’ 2024 Workforce Report, 51% of surveyed individuals contemplate job changes, primarily driven by salary aspirations. Concurrently, 60% anticipate promotions, with 50% intending to seek new opportunities if promotions elude them. Such data confirms a shift towards prioritizing personal fulfillment over traditional work commitments. Employers are urged to capitalize on internal mobility, evidenced by a 13% decrease in external hires compared to the previous year, signaling opportunities for career growth within organizations.\n\nDespite the optimism displayed by 87% of employees regarding job security, driven perhaps by economic stabilization, workforce strategies demand agility. HR leaders must nurture employee engagement through skill development initiatives, vital for retention and internal advancement. To read more about job security, see 22 Careers with the Best Job Security.\n\nWith an aim to impart education and skills, in 2018, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) introduced a groundbreaking education benefit, offering $1-a-day tuition for approximately 30 college degrees. Fast forward to today, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is drastically reducing its degree offerings from 30 to just eight, while expanding short-form certificate programs to over 50 options.\n\nThe revamped program aims to equip employees with in-demand skills like generative AI and data-driven decision making. By doing so, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to fill around 100,000 jobs within the next three years, focusing on roles such as software engineering and pharmacy technicians.\n\nWhile some may perceive the reduction in degree options as a limitation, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) focuses on the benefits of short-term certificate programs. These programs typically take four months to complete, offering a quicker path to career advancement compared to the six to eight years typically required for a college degree.\n\nOne of the companies with the lowest turnover rates in the world is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, the company is strategically expanding its Vision Pro VR headset beyond the US, with recent job listings in countries like Australia, China, and Japan hinting at an imminent global launch. Initially released solely in the US for $3,499, the Vision Pro's international rollout has been eagerly anticipated. Job postings seeking \"Briefing Experience Specialists\" in these markets signify  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s intention to introduce the device to a broader audience.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s meticulous approach to ensuring a seamless customer experience, especially concerning fitting and prescription lenses, underpinned its initial US-only release. However, the ongoing language expansion and job listings suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s readiness to cater to a global audience. While specific release dates remain undisclosed, these developments strongly suggest that the Vision Pro's reach will extend beyond US shores soon. 10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US\n\nA construction site featuring a large concrete foundation poured by the cement manufacturing company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the industries with the highest number of quits in the US, we relied on seasonally adjusted data on quit rates by industry from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of January 2024. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Mining and Logging\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%\n\nIn addition to volatile energy prices affecting the oil and natural gas drilling sector, the mining and logging industry in the US is facing high resignation rates due to several factors. One significant reason is increased concerns over workplace safety and environmental sustainability, prompting workers to seek alternative employment in less hazardous or more environmentally conscious sectors. Moreover, technological advancements and automation are reducing the demand for manual labor in these industries, leading to job insecurity and prompting workers to explore new career paths.\n\nTo read more about the dangers involved with jobs in this industry, see the most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\n9. Manufacturing (Durable Goods)\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.6%\n\nManufacturing is one of the top industries with the highest number of quits in the US.\n\nLet’s look at some of the reasons why the resignation rate in the industry is high. The nature of manufacturing work often involves physically demanding tasks, long hours, and repetitive duties, leading to dissatisfaction among workers. Secondly, wages in the manufacturing industry may not always be competitive compared to other sectors, prompting employees to seek higher-paying opportunities elsewhere. Thirdly, limited opportunities for career and professional growth can discourage employees from staying long-term.\n\n8. Information\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.7%\n\nThe high quit rate in the information industry, especially among technologists, is driven by the rapid evolution of technology that necessitates continuous skill updates, prompting professionals to seek new roles offering better growth prospects. Moreover, intense competition fosters job mobility as individuals pursue higher pay and improved conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the widespread adoption of remote work expands the range of potential employers, granting technologists greater flexibility. These dynamics create an environment where professionals actively explore and capitalize on available opportunities, leading to the industry's increased quit rate.\n\n7. Construction\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.8%\n\nConstruction is one ofthe industries that need the most workers. In the US, the industry is facing major challenges, notably a shortage of skilled workers impacting project costs and timelines. Reports suggest over half a million positions need filling, including roles like heavy equipment operators, carpenters, and electricians. This deficit is worsened by factors such as the Great Resignation and a lack of young recruits. Construction companies are exploring solutions like training programs and technology integration. To read more about shortages, see 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\n6. Manufacturing (Non Durable Goods)\n\nQuits Rate as of January 2024: 1.9%\n\nThe manufacturing industry faces several major challenges in its workforce, reflected in alarming statistics. High turnover rates, averaging 39.9% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pose a persistent obstacle. Such turnover not only disrupts production but also results in substantial financial losses due to the need for frequent retraining. Moreover, the sector struggles with a critical shortage of skilled workers, with Deloitte projecting over two million unfilled manufacturing jobs by 2025. This scarcity threatens the industry's growth potential, potentially resulting in a $1 trillion loss to the US economy by 2030.\n\nClick here to see the 5 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 20 Fastest Growing Industries in the Next 5 Years: Predictions 15 Fast-Growing Industries Looking To Hire in the US Top 19 Industries That Are Hiring Right Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Industries with the Highest Number of Quits in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches from Apple to Tesla challenger as its first EV racks up 120,000 orders in 36 hours",
        "content": "Anyone who’s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it’s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun—a household name in China—said at the presentation in Beijing: \"Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn't it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?\"\n\nThe entrant of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk’s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla’s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk’s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China’s Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world’s top EV seller.\n\nOf course, Tesla has already proven itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.\n\n\"In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. \"Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.\"\n\nIn February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was “shocked” by the decision. He's cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.\n\nXiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.\n\nBig bet on EVs\n\nLei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nLei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, \"Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.”\n\nTime will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the competitive EV market or if it should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.\n\n\"The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.\n\nBut Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year’s production capacity is sold out.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That I'm \"Never\" Selling",
        "content": "When I buy a stock, I try to remind myself that I am buying a small part of a business and that I intend to hold my stocks for the long term. Warren Buffett famously said that his favorite holding period is forever. While that's aspirational more than anything, it's an important reminder that success in investing comes from identifying great businesses and then letting them compound over decades.\n\nWhile some stocks in my portfolio have a lot more to prove to stay there forever, there are some that I can't imagine myself selling. These businesses have long track records and competitive advantages that should pave the way for bright futures. As the saying goes, \"Never say never.\" Yet with these stocks, I'm as close to never selling as one can be.\n\nCostco\n\nEvery time I am struggling to find parking or waiting in the long (but efficient) line to check out, I ask myself why I don't own more Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) stock. While most of my fellow shoppers are likely not having the same thought, we're all there to take advantage of the bulk quantities and low prices. History tells us that this business model has been wildly successful with Costco shares gaining more than 81,000% since its IPO.\n\nCostco ended its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended February 2024) as the third-largest global retailer and the 12th-largest company in the Fortune 500, with 874 locations worldwide. Its membership model works well. More than 92% of Costco members renew their membership and the company brought in nearly $5 billion in membership fees in the past 12 months.\n\nThe low prices keep customers coming in the door, and because Costco sells fewer items than its competitors and turns its inventory over very quickly, it can sometimes even sell items before they need to be paid for. This helps cash flows and reduces expenses.\n\nAmazon\n\nIf there's a retailer that comes first to mind for me other than Costco, it has to be Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). I don't think I am alone in finding myself shopping there before almost anywhere else. Over the trailing 12 months, Amazon stock is up 82%. However, during the market slump of 2022, the company fell nearly 50% as it struggled to get its finances back in order following the massive distribution build-out necessitated by the pandemic surge in orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is certainly back on track and ready to reaccelerate its growth. In 2023, Amazon grew revenue by 12% but the more impressive results were further down the income statement. Operating income increased by 202% and net income grew by 1,226%. These results were driven by a recovery in the e-commerce business, which finally turned the corner after its 2022 struggles. It's also worth remembering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in cloud infrastructure and it grew its revenue by 13% in 2023.\n\nApple\n\nConsumer electronics giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Finding itself increasingly under the microscope of federal antitrust investigations, the stock has fallen 12% over the past three months. This news is certainly worth watching, but it will take years to play out and the rather modest decline in Apple's share price suggests the market's level of concern is less severe than some of the headlines indicate.\n\nTaking a step back, it's important to remember that Apple is still a ubiquitous brand around the world, and especially within the United States. Known for its iPhone and other consumer electronic devices, Apple is slowly becoming a software company. Apple now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices.\n\nThis creates an ecosystem of apps and subscription services that provide a high-margin income stream for the company. In the most recently reported quarter, services revenue (which is where all the subscription products are reported) grew by 11% to $23 billion. This represents 19% of total revenue, up from 18% in the year prior.\n\nWhy I'm \"never\" selling\n\nAre there scenarios in which I might sell these companies? Sure, anything is possible. However, these three businesses are so competitively advantaged and are still growing so impressively at their large scale, that it's difficult to envision a scenario where they wouldn't warrant a spot in my portfolio. Investing can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. In my mind, buying and owning these three stocks is about as simple as investing can be.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock: Apple or Tesla?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have delivered outstanding returns to investors in recent years, and they continue to outperform. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 19% year to date, beating the Nasdaq Composite's return of 9.6%.\n\nBut not all seven stocks are up this year. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 12% and 27%, respectively. Nonetheless, they have tremendous brand power in their respective markets, and neither will stay down forever. So now is a good time to compare their growth potential to see which offers more upside from here.\n\nApple\n\nApple stock rose 43% over the last three years, but it has been weighed down by market share losses for the iPhone in China. The nation generates 21% of Apple's operating profit. The company was also hit by an antitrust lawsuit by the Department of Justice in March, but that's not as concerning for investors as the slowing product revenue growth.\n\nDespite increasing competition in China, iPhone revenue grew 6% year over year in the quarter ending in December 2023, with management giving credit to a record number of people upgrading.\n\nBut it will be challenging for iPhone sales to grow much faster over the long term. The global marketing intelligence firm IDC forecasts smartphone unit shipments will increase by just 2.6% on an annualized basis through 2027.\n\nNonetheless, one opportunity that management is excited about is selling more devices in the enterprise market. This could be a ripe market for its new Vision Pro headset that launched in February. Top companies like Walmart and Nike are investing in Vision Pro and learning ways to bring the device's spatial computing abilities to their employees.\n\nThe most important growth driver for Apple is increasing the active installed base of devices, which now exceeds 2.2 billion. The Vision Pro could expand this base in the years to come, and importantly, it could help drive higher spending on apps and subscriptions and other high-margin services. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, driven by share repurchases and higher margins from services revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts forecast Apple's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 9% over the long term. Assuming the stock's price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, that would lead to a return of at least 50% by 2029.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla is facing similar headwinds. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are gaining market share, while rising interest rates are making it more expensive for people to finance a new car this year. Revenue grew 19% in 2023 but is expected to slow to an increase of 12% in 2024.\n\nThe company shouldn't be down for long. The EV market is expected to grow 23% on an annualized basis through 2033, according to Precedence Research. In 2025, Wall Street analysts predict that revenue growth will reaccelerate to nearly 20%.\n\nTesla has several advantages: a large charging-station network, a sophisticated smartphone app, and investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The investments in AI are not only important for self-driving capabilities but could also help boost efficiency and profits through the use of robots in its factories.\n\nIt is already one of the most profitable automakers in the world, generating a significantly higher margin than any of the top U.S. manufacturers, but it's not done improving margins. The company is transitioning to its next-generation manufacturing process that is designed to reduce costs, which could lead to higher margins in a stronger sales environment.\n\nThe tailwind for EV sales and Tesla's ability to crank out more vehicles at a profit is why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 15%. This would be enough to potentially double the stock price over the next five years.\n\nWhich stock should you buy?\n\nIf you're looking for the stock that has more upside potential over the next decade, I believe Tesla is the better choice.\n\nApple is a great business, but the smartphone market is further along the global adoption curve than are EVs, which make up a small share of annual car sales. As Tesla continues to drive down costs and release cutting-edge new models like the Cybertruck, the stock could be a rewarding investment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Forget Apple: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock club is almost a year old now, and some of the predictions that originally inspired it are playing out as expected. The \"baby bubble\" that Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett foreshadowed in May 2023 is losing some air.\n\nI'm looking at you, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe electric vehicle pioneer and the iPhone maker have underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index since the term Magnificent Seven entered Wall Street's lexicon. In fact, Apple investors have lost money on the stock since Hartnett first used the classic Western movie title in a public report.\n\nThey are still business giants with popular products and trendsetting market footprints. Apple holds on to its trendsetting status by sheer scale -- not many stocks can claim a $2 trillion market cap, after all.\n\nYet it might be time someday soon to rethink the Magnificent Seven components. Apple can regain its seat with another round of game-changing innovations and unheard-of product ideas (the Vision Pro headset probably won't do that job in 2024).\n\nAnd I think it's time to give the crypto market a seat at the Magnificent table. History suggests -- supported by planned technical upgrades to leading cryptocurrency systems -- that another massive price surge is coming up soon. To shrug off this incoming surge as if nothing is happening would be a big mistake.\n\nThat's why I'd like to print a Magnificent Seven membership card for Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN), North America's leading crypto exchange and digital assets promoter.\n\nCoinbase is a big deal in 2024: Here's why\n\nThe Magnificent Seven combine amazing innovation and financial might. They dominate large-scale global markets with pioneering technologies and robust investment in research and development (R&D). As undisputed leaders in their fields, their significant impact on market indexes and clear growth trajectories can shape the future economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase fits that description to a T. In fact, I would argue that the crypto wrangler's growth trajectory and R&D spending leave Apple far behind.\n\nThe company stands at the heart of the cryptocurrency revolution, perfectly placed to capitalize on these upcoming industry milestones:\n\nWith the upcoming Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) halving, historical trends hint at a potential uptick in market activity, drawing attention across the cryptocurrency landscape. This event, along with Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) stepwise upgrades toward a more scalable network, signals a pivotal moment for blockchain technologies. The growing interest in Web3, with its focus on privacy, decentralized finance, and a more user-centric internet, further highlights the sector's potential for expansion. These innovations should generate increased market activity and broader investor interest over time. As a key platform offering access to important Web3 cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot(CRYPTO: DOT), Coinbase will undoubtedly benefit from this trend. And the introduction of Bitcoin spot-price exchange-traded funds marks a significant leap toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. These developments not only underscore the market's maturity but also widen the investor base, channeling more transactions through platforms like Coinbase. Old-school banks are not ready to offer crypto transactions or digital wallets yet, giving Coinbase a huge head start in a digital economy.\n\nIn this rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, Coinbase is strategically positioned to leverage the anticipated growth and increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. These technological advancements and regulatory milestones set the stage for an intense crypto drama over the next couple of years.\n\nWhy Coinbase belongs in the stock market elite\n\nGame-changing success is never easy, and Coinbase also faces many difficult challenges.\n\nThe regulatory rule book can change in a heartbeat, perhaps moving in different directions across various countries. The real-world pricing effects of Bitcoin halvings have been predictable so far, but there's no certainty that the next one will unleash the same results. Quantum computing might break the encrypted security model of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies, forcing a brand-new technical design in the long run.\n\nI could go on, but you get the picture: Coinbase's near-term and long-term success could be quite likely, but I can never call it \"guaranteed.\"\n\nBut that's why they play the game, right?\n\nOne investor's best idea can be another's darkest nightmare, and the price of any stock or cryptocurrency is negotiated to settle their differences of opinion. In the long run, the underlying business proves who's right and who's wrong. And in this case, I think Coinbase's growth prospects should lead to impressive shareholder gains in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAnd Coinbase will do it in a market-defining way with a heavy dose of innovation. That makes it a robust \"Magnificent\" candidate, ready to step in if and when Apple misplaces its membership card.\n\nAdding Coinbase to the Magnificent Seven vernacular just before the crypto market takes off again could make Wall Street analysts look like prophetic geniuses for a while. So move over, Apple, I think it's time to hand that seat over to Coinbase -- at least for a while.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coinbase Global wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Warren Buffett Sell More Apple Stock Because of the DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit -- and Should You?",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has been a big fan of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in recent years. However, some might think he's not as enthusiastic about the stock as he used to be. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in the tech giant.\n\nThis transaction was made before the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it, along with 16 state and district attorneys general, were suing Apple because the company allegedly violated antitrust laws. Will Buffett sell more Apple stock because of the DOJ antitrust lawsuit -- and should you?\n\nWhy the DOJ is suing Apple\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the press release announcing the DOJ lawsuit, \"Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws.\" He added, \"We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.\"\n\nHow does the DOJ think Apple is violating antitrust laws? The department's complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey listed several specific allegations against Apple, including that the company:\n\nBlocked iPhone apps that would make it easier for consumers to switch to other smartphone platforms. Blocked the development of mobile cloud streaming services that would allow consumers to play video games without having to purchase costly smartphone hardware. Excluded messaging apps on iPhones that work well across multiple smartphone platforms. Limited the functionality of rivals to the Apple Watch. Limited rival digital wallets by preventing apps from allowing users to tap to pay.\n\nApple disputes all of the DOJ's allegations. The company responded, \"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\" Apple also said, \"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWill Buffett now sell more Apple stock?\n\nCould Buffett sell additional shares of Apple because of the DOJ lawsuit? Sure. Will he do so? I doubt it.\n\nBuffett has stood by some of his favorite companies in the past that faced antitrust scrutiny. For example, European Union and U.S. antitrust regulators have investigated Coca-Cola. However, Berkshire Hathaway didn't sell any of its position in the food and beverage company.\n\nMore importantly, Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting last May that Apple was \"a better business\" than any others that the conglomerate owned. I don't think the DOJ's allegations would shift his view, especially so quickly.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, Buffett didn't decide to sell Apple shares in Q4 after all. One of Berkshire's other two investment managers could have made the recent sale. The sale of roughly 10 million Apple shares could also have come from Berkshire subsidiary General Reinsurance's portfolio, which Buffett doesn't directly control.\n\nShould you sell Apple stock?\n\nI think there are some legitimate reasons to consider selling Apple stock. The company's growth has slowed considerably. Its valuation is arguably too steep in light of this sluggishness, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of 26x.\n\nHowever, it's way too soon to sell because of the DOJ lawsuit, in my view. Apple will almost certainly mount a strong defense against the antitrust allegations. The lawsuit could be more of a distraction than anything else.\n\nI also believe there's a compelling reason to hold on to Apple stock. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI. He also said, \"Later this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future.\"\n\nThe company's annual developers conference is scheduled for June 10 through 14. Like many others, I expect Apple will reveal its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy at this conference.\n\nThe DOJ antitrust lawsuit will likely take years to play out. Apple could have big AI news on the way soon. I intend to hold on to my shares of the tech giant. I suspect that Buffett will too. And I think that any investor who sells before Apple reveals its AI strategy could regret doing so.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.\n\nThe advantages of international mobility and a second country where one could live and work has gained much prominence over the years. While immigration and citizenship laws across countries have become friendlier (check out our article on 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World), acquiring citizenship or permanent residency requires substantial time-- other than for direct citizenship by investment programs-- and energy. However, another way to live and work in a country can be easily obtained through a residence permit.\n\nResidence Permit: An Overview\n\nA residence permit is basically a document that provides the holder a right to live in a specific country for a specific period of time. The residence permit allows one to live, buy property, cross border, do business, take advantage of medical facilities, and enroll in educational institutions, among others. There are multiple ways of getting a residence permit, which includes marriage, work, study, or investment. The need for international diversification in terms of both human force and foreign direct investment has propelled countries to recognize the need for making special provisions for investors, businessmen and highly qualified and skilled individuals.\n\nIt is thus, no wonder that the issuance of residence permit have registered an increase over the years. In European Union countries, for instance, 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in 2022 to non-EU citizens, a 26% increase (+753445 permit) from 2021. While there are various ways to obtain a residence permit -- with “Employment Reasons” taking the larger share (42%) of all first residence permits for EU countries in 2021 -- the investment route (Golden Visa) is by far the easier and quicker option.\n\nThe global demand for investor visas have sustained an upward trend with more than 165,000 people opting for them from the US, UK, Canada, and EU countries during the years 2008-2022. One of the popular investor visas include the US EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that has been operating for more than 30 years. From 2010-2019, the US approved 81,125 investor visas, which is higher than the combined visas issued by Canada, UK, and Portugal. A rise in the trend for European Golden Visas have also been noted. Greece, for example, recorded a 63% increase in the demand for their residence permit programs—from January to May 2023, 3,900 Golden Visa applications had been submitted as compared to 1,444 in 2022. Canada, through their Start-Up Visa, also allowed 175 new permanent residents in August, 2023, a 29.6% increase from July, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped Countries: A Prosperous Investment Avenue\n\nDeveloped countries like the US, Canada and EU states have prosperous economies that foster investment. America is the world’s largest national economy and a global leader in trade. Home to some of the top companies in the world like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc., the US investment environment is bound to attract investors and entrepreneurs. Other regions around the world, like Europe, can also boast of growing economies. With a population of about 743.5 million in 2022, twice that of the US, Europe is home to not just a large number of people but also hosts some of the largest economies in the world. Germany, for example had a GDP of $4.26 trillion in 2021, fourth worldwide with regard to nominal GDP. The 27 country European Union economic block accounts for about 14% of the world’s total trade in goods. The total value of goods and services produced in the region also amounted to €14.5 trillion in 2021. Given such statistics, the proliferation of many top-notch multinational companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc. into the area is not surprising.\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG), for instance, just recently cemented their European AI investments by announcing a €25M (US$26.98m) investment that is geared towards improvement in AI skills across the region. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) on the other hand, invested an additional €1 billion to expand Silicon Design Centre, earlier last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), has also made a recent commitment to expand their cloud infrastructure to meet the demand in Europe.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to compile our list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit, we base our method on residence permit received by investment as the easiest way. For this we first select Residency Programs being offered and then pick out the popular or leading Residency by Investment Programs by scouring web as well as our article. We then look at their minimum cost and application processing time and rank them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We take a weighted average for the two metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) allotted to cost and the lower to time (0.4). We present our list in a descending order of rank.\n\nNote: The figures for the approximate US Dollar amounts are based on the current exchange rate and are therefore subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16. Malta\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 7\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 22\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 13\n\nOne of the popular countries for investor looking to either gain a residency or citizenship, Malta is also one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. An economically and politically sound country, the country has much to offer investors. The high quality of life to tax advantages, all have contributed to the country’s popularity for residency and investment schemes. According to the requirements of the program, the investor must have at least €500,000 (approximately US $545,000) worth of assets, €150,000 (approximately US $163,500) of which should be invested in liquid financial assets. In addition, other stipulations of the program demand property acquisition or lease as well as economic contribution to Maltese economy and donation to a non-governmental organization. Permanent residency is obtained immediately after the application process is complete, which takes about 6-8 months.\n\n15. Costa Rica\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 6\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 23\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.8\n\nCosta Rica is yet another of the countries that provides easy access to residence permit. With only a US $150,000 investment-- in either property or business -- under the Investor Visa Program, one can find a way to settle down in the country. Forestry projects, however, requires only $100,000 investment. The initial residence permit issued is for two years which is then also renewable, provided the investor maintains the investment. The application process time is a bit higher than other programs, taking about 9 months.\n\n14. Cyprus\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 13\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.2\n\nWhile searching for a country where the residence permit can be obtained easily, Cyprus would appear as a viable option. Not only is the minimum investment choice modest, €300,000 (approximately $327,000) in various types of investments such as property, business, fund, and securities, but the time taken to process the whole application is among the fastest (2 months).\n\n13. Malaysia\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 9\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 15\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 11.4\n\nEasy and efficient, Malaysia’s My Second Home Program grants its applicants a 10-year multiple entry visa, which is also renewable. Under this scheme the investor has the choice to pick from three options of investment with different outlay for each. The minimum investment (known as the Silver Tier) corresponds to MYR 500,000 (approximately US $230,000) to be deposited in a Malaysian bank. The tile for application to process is 3-6 months.\n\n12. Canada\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 1\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 26\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 11\n\nCanada’s Start-Up Visa Program is not only the best Golden Visa program that has been attracted many an investors, but is also one of the easiest for getting a residence permit. This is primarily due to the non-existent cost of the program. Here the applicant is not required to make an investment themselves but can provide backing of accredited external investors. A C$200,000 (approximately US $148,000) commitment from a designated Canadian venture capital funds, a C$75,000 (approximately US $55,500) commitment from part of a designated Canadian angel investor groups, or a confirmation that the start-up is part of a designated Canadian business incubator program are the different options available. The application process time however, is somewhat higher in comparison to other applications.\n\n11. Panama\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 5\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 19\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.6\n\nFor people wishful to seek residence in Panama through a quick and easy way of investment, have the choice of two different visas; their Golden Visa known as the Qualified Investor Visa and their Active Investor Visa. Under the qualified investor visa the minimum investment amounts to US $100,000 in a company that has a forest registry with the Ministry of Environment. This will allow a temporary residence of two years and the application processing time is 4 months for the forestry application. Panama also offers an Active Investor Visa known as Panama’s Business Investor Residency Permit. To qualify for this scheme this investor must invest US $160,000 in a new or existing business in Panama, creating at least five full-time jobs for Panama citizens and where the investor is involved on a daily basis with the business.\n\n10. Spain\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 16\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.4\n\nA hot-spot for most expats, tourists and investors, Spain’s Golden Visa Program is set to attract foreign direct investment into the country whilst creating ease and efficiency for the investors. They have the choice to select one of the four available investment options which includes property investment, bank deposit, business and bond investment.

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n“I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n11.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue.

(NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company’s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\n\nSince we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about CNBC's Alpha Stock Survey according to which a “majority” of investors believe the market is headed for a pullback. Cramer is not at all worried about a possible decline in the market.\n\n\"Hallelujah about that survey,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said that the S&P 500 is up 10% in the first three months of 2024, registering the best quarter since 2019. This makes Cramer believe that the market is indeed heading for a pullback. But he said we should “welcome it, not fear it.”\n\nJim Cramer \"Welcomes\" Market Sell-Offs\n\nJim Cramer said that sell-offs are “inevitable.” He said even though we don’t know when they will hit, they are always expected and we should take them as buying opportunities. Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% “beatdown” every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year. Lynch said the stock market follows corporate earnings and as a result made almost accurate predictions about the Dow Jones growing at about 8% per year.\n\nCramer Thinks Market's \"Breadth Problem\" is Solved\n\nJim Cramer also said that anyone who still “insists” that this market is just about major tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other Mag. 7 stocks, they should rethink since he believes there are “so many winners” in the market that “it’s insane.” Cramer believes the market no longer has the “breadth” problem because returns are expanding across the board, sometimes at the “expense” of mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer thinks that it’s of no use to stay fixated on the Federal Reserve for now, with all indications saying the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates. Cramer wants investors to instead focus on earnings and the performance of individual companies. Cramer said we haven’t seen mass rounds of layoffs that many in the “hard landing” camp were expecting. He said we are prepared to see another hot jobs report, but if it comes softer-than-expected, we will go into the next earnings season with a “pleasant backdrop.” Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few days and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nJim Cramer hit the ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ button on LNG company New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) during one of his recent programs on CNBC. Cramer said Wes Edens (New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) CEO) is “absolutely terrific at what he does.” Cramer said he likes the stock at the current levels.\n\n10. Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT). Here’s what he said about the sock.\n\n“Oh my god, this is the hottest stock, it’s gonna make money too.”\n\nCramer said that Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT) is a “DevOps shop.” Cramer said that it’s a “hardware-software platform” and people “love these kinds of stocks” and they cannot “live without them.”\n\nEarlier this month, Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT) posted Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.04, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 48.1% year over year to $276.27 million, beating estimates by $17.96 million.\n\n9. Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nJim Cramer thinks Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) is a “great company to buy here.” Cramer said that this mineral company is a “terrific\" and \"really good\" idea.\n\nOver the past one year Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) shares have gained about 4% over the past one year.\n\nEarlier this month, the stock was downgraded by Liberum to Hold from Buy amid softening demand and China-related concerns.\n\n8. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nPennsylvania-based  optical materials and semiconductors company Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to buy. Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) has “a lot of lasers, a lot of optics, a lot of good stuff.” Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) is “gonna make money this year.” He said investors should buy some of Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) stock now and then wait for the stock to come down to buy some more.\n\nIn addition to COHR, Cramer also likes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds had stakes in Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR).\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In addition to Diamondback Energy, we also initiated positions in Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) and HCA Healthcare in Q4. Coherent supplies engineered materials and devices to semiconductor equipment companies, data center and telecom companies, and it also produces lasers for industrial applications. The company has a long history of successfully innovating in these areas and is well-positioned to benefit from demand for advanced transceivers as artificial intelligence (AI) investments increase. As near-term cyclical headwinds have weighed on the share price, we capitalized on what we view as an attractive price relative to our estimate of intrinsic value to initiate a position.”\n\n7. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nWhen asked about Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), Cramer said that it’s making money and since the stock has run a lot, investors should buy some of it now and then wait for a pullback before buying more.\n\nPure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG) shares have gained 50% year to date through March 29.\n\nDuring its earnings call last month, the company talked about shareholder returns and guidance:\n\n\"We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY ’25. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY ’25, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.\n\nTo help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY ’25 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY ’24. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY ’25 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY ’25 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY ’24 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nGenerators and power systems company Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is highly bullish on. Recently, a questioner asked Jim Cramer during his program whether he should sell Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) to buy another stock. Cramer said, “ I forbid you to sell Cummins.” Cramer said that Jennifer Rumsey (Cummins' CEO) is doing “such a fabulous job.” In addition to CMI, Cramer also likes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Mining Stocks with Heavy Insider Buying in 2024 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Raking In $4.36 Billion in Annual Dividend Income From These 5 Stocks",
        "content": "For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling professional and everyday investors with outsize investment returns. Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 34,000%, including dividends paid, since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares have appreciated by more than 5,000,000%.\n\nBuffett and his investment team have long relied on brand-name, time-tested, and well-managed businesses to deliver superior returns. But it's Buffett's preference for dividend stocks that might provide one of the biggest boosts to Berkshire's long-term outperformance.\n\nAccording to a report issued last year by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have produced an average annual return of 9.18% over a half-century (1973-2022). This compares to a modest 3.95% average annual return for public companies that don't offer a payout. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nCompanies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with their investors are almost always time-tested and able to offer transparent long-term growth outlooks. This is why Berkshire Hathaway's $370 billion investment portfolio is packed with dozens of dividend stocks.\n\nBut diversification was never big with Buffett or his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger. Although the investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee is on pace to generate about $6 billion in annual dividend income, a whopping $4.36 billion in combined common- and preferred-stock dividends can be traced to just five companies.\n\nBank of America: $991.5 million in annual dividend income\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding by market value ($38 billion), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is the Buffett's dividend breadwinner. The more than 1 billion shares of BofA Berkshire owns will yield almost $992 million in annual dividend income.\n\nThe reason Buffett has long favored financial stocks (especially banks) is because they benefit from disproportionately long periods of U.S. growth. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the U.S. economic cycle, they have all been short-lived since the end of World War II.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy comparison, there have been two expansions that surpassed the decade mark. Cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America are able to steadily increase their interest income and fee-generating loan portfolios as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThe other well-defined lure for Bank of America is that it's the most interest-sensitive money-center bank in the United States. This is to say that its net-interest income will increase or decrease more with changes to the prevailing interest rate than with other big banks. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle during the past two years has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line.\n\nOccidental Petroleum: $897.5 million in annual dividend income\n\nThe second-biggest dividend payer in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio might come as a bit of a surprise. Energy stock Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY), which doesn't have a particularly hefty yield, is on pace to provide more than $897 million in aggregate annual income this year.\n\nBased on the roughly 248 million shares of Occidental common stock that Berkshire has acquired since the start of 2022, Buffett's company should collect more than $218 million in dividend income this year. But Berkshire also owns $8.49 billion in preferred stock in Occidental that yields 8% annually ($679.2 million a year). This was originally a $10 billion stake, but Occidental has since redeemed $1.51 billion of the issue.\n\nThe reason Occidental Petroleum is so attractive to Buffett and his crew likely is because it's more linked than other integrated oil and gas companies to the spot price of crude oil. It generates the bulk of its sales from its drilling operations.\n\nMore than three years of reduced capital investment from major energy companies during the pandemic has constrained global oil supply and provided a lift to the spot price of crude. If prices remain elevated, Occidental should enjoy an outsized benefit. Image source: Apple.\n\nApple: $869.3 million in annual dividend income\n\nIt's probably no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by market value ($154.7 billion), tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), is one of the biggest providers of dividend income. Even after Buffett and his aides pared down Berkshire's Apple stake by some 10 million shares during the fourth quarter, the nearly 905.6 million shares still held will generate about $869 million in annual dividend income.\n\nThe beauty of Apple stock has long been its exceptional branding, strong customer loyalty, and top-tier innovation. Though it remains the domestic leader in smartphone market share, much of the future growth is expected to come from its shift to services.\n\nCEO Tim Cook is overseeing a steady push toward subscriptions, which should smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur just before major iPhone upgrade cycles, as well as keep customers loyal to Apple's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nBut if you ask Buffett, his favorite thing about Apple might be its market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it has repurchased almost $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only is this providing a boost to Apple's earnings per share, but it is also steadily increasing Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in the company without having to do a thing.\n\nChevron: $822.1 million in annual dividend income\n\nOil stocks are historically known for their robust payouts. In addition to collecting over $897 million from Occidental Petroleum, Buffett's company should be on the receiving end of more than $822 million in annual payouts from Chevron(NYSE: CVX). The dividend hike Chevron announced in February marked the 37th consecutive year it has lifted its base annual payout.\n\nEven though Chevron and Occidental are subject to the same macro forces, Chevron's outlook is a bit different than Occidental. That's because Chevron's revenue channels are skewed more toward its non-drilling assets, such as pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These midstream and downstream assets produce highly predictable cash flow in virtually any economy.\n\nChevron also has what can be considered one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies. It closed out 2023 with a net debt ratio of just 7.3%. Given its storied history of generating positive cash flow from its operations, Chevron has the financial flexibility to make big acquisitions and return a lot of money to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.\n\nCoca-Cola: $776 million in annual dividend income\n\nThe fifth dividend stock that -- along with Bank of America, Occidental, Apple, and Chevron -- is helping Warren Buffett and his team oversee the collection of $4.36 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is consumer staples titan Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nCoca-Cola has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since 1988. Because the cost basis on the 400 million shares held by Berkshire is so low (about $3.2475 per share), Coke's $1.94-per-share annual payout equates to a nearly 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company.\n\nWhat's made Coca-Cola stock such a wonderful investment for decades is its geographic diversity. It has operations in every country worldwide with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia. This means it's able to take advantage of faster organic growth in emerging markets, while still generating highly predictable operating cash flow in developed countries. It also has more than two dozen brands that generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nTop-shelf marketing is another reason Coca-Cola has been able to increase its annual dividend in each of the past 62 years. It's leaning on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements for younger audiences, and can rely on its well-known brand ambassadors and rich history to connect with more-mature consumers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Huawei Profit Surges as It Takes Share From Apple and Alibaba",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sustained its run of strong quarterly profit growth, building on the resurgence of its consumer business against Apple Inc.’s iPhone and the rise of its cloud division against incumbent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFed’s Preferred Inflation Metric Cools While Spending Rebounds Tesla’s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Powell Reiterates Fed Doesn’t Need to Be In Hurry to Cut Rates Bank of Russia Sees No Alternative to Yuan for Its Reserves Apple Plans New iPad Pro for May as Production Ramps Up Overseas\n\nThe Chinese networking and electronics leader reported net profit of about 13.9 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in the December quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations from its financial figures. That’s more than 65% higher than the 8.4 billion yuan tally a year earlier.\n\nThe results underscore how Huawei, the target of US sanctions and export controls for years, has progressed in navigating through the challenges. In August, the company unveiled its flagship Mate 60 smartphone lineup with a domestically designed and produced 7-nanometer processor, setting off a wave of nationalistic popularity at home. Its consumer electronics division surged by 17.3% in 2023, to bring in sales of 251.5 billion yuan.\n\nHuawei, which was almost knocked out of smartphones and chipmaking after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is emerging as a symbol of China’s determination to thwart Washington’s curbs. It’s now building a network of chipmaking plants to underpin its longer-term ambitions in arenas such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company’s cloud computing arm grew by nearly 22% during the year, as it made further inroads in competing with Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home. This month, the firm deployed an artificial intelligence-powered weather forecasting model with the meteorological bureau of Shenzhen, its home city. The company’s chips are also showing up in the systems of Chinese AI developers, such as the one used by the Hong Kong-based Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to train an AI assistant for neurosurgeons.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Huawei hasn’t gone as far as Xiaomi Corp., which this week launched its first own-brand EVs, the Shenzhen company’s making progress in providing technology for the automotive sector. That business grew by 128% in 2023, and Huawei has been showing off Aito vehicles in its stores in China.\n\nHuawei’s resurgence coincides with growing pressure on Apple from the Chinese government, which is increasingly mandating or encouraging the use of homegrown devices and technology across different industries and sectors — including state enterprises. The rise of the Mate 60 has also fired up consumer enthusiasm for local brands.\n\nIPhone shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier, according to official data, extending a slump in demand for the flagship device in its most important overseas market.\n\nBut Huawei in December warned of the dangers a volatile industry and global economy will pose in 2024. In the wake of its 7nm breakthrough, officials in Washington are weighing a variety of responses from blacklisting Huawei suppliers to roping in allies to tighten an existing blockade of semiconductor technology.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the US will “do whatever it takes” to protect its national security.\n\nRead More: Apple China Slowdown Sparks Fears That Prized Market Is at Risk\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto The Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "20 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at 20 countries that receive the most foreign direct investment. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nAn Analysis of the World’s Foreign Investment\n\nThe global investment landscape was gloomy in 2022, mainly due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, turbulence in financial markets, and climate change causing investment uncertainty around the globe. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) suffered due to economic volatility but remained more resilient than expected. According to IMF’s World Investment Report 2023, the global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022 after declining 12 percentage points from the previous year. Despite the decline, investment inflows to the developing countries increased marginally; however, growth was concentrated in a few emerging economies. On the other hand, the FDI to the least developed countries declined, with FDI in 46 least developed countries falling to $22 billion after a decrease of 16%. Investors ended the year by announcing new industrial and infrastructural projects. To read more about investments, you can look at 12 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the US and 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.\n\nThe greenfield investment trends presented a bright spot for the international investment landscape, with the number of new projects increasing by 15% for 2022 and in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The FDI and the number of new greenfield projects also increased in developing countries. The FDI in developing countries increased by 4%, reaching $916 billion. Meanwhile, the number of new greenfield project announcements witnessed a 37% increase, thereby signaling a positive indication for investment prospects in industry and infrastructure.\n\nMoving forward, foreign direct investment is expected to increase modestly in 2024. On January 17, Reuters reported that the United Nations trade body was positive about global FDI rising modestly in 2024. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the projections for inflation and the cost of borrowing in the major markets indicate stabilization to attract international investment deals, thereby increasing global FDI in 2024. The organization, however, stressed that the geopolitical risks and high debt levels in some countries could hinder the prospects of FDI. In 2023, the foreign direct investment amounted to approximately $1.37 trillion, a marginal increase of 3% from the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Country that Attracts the Most FDI: The United States\n\nThe United States is one of the largest hosts of foreign direct investment and has announced several greenfield projects and international infrastructural and industrial deals. Some of the top companies in the US market that are driving economic growth include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the leading multinational companies based in the United States. The company engages in various markets, including retail sales of consumer goods, subscription services, and advertising. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates through its physical and online stores throughout the globe. On February 1, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.0 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.20. The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 13.91% year-over-year and amounted to $169.96 billion, ahead of market consensus by $3.70 billion. Here are some comments from Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings call for Q4 2023:\n\nThese events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we’ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is another multinational technology company based in the United States. The company is renowned for its wide range of platforms, services, and products, including Google Cloud, Google Search engine, and Android. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a leading company that invests in technology and data infrastructure globally and has a business presence across America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific.

The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $86.31 billion, up 13.49% year-over-year and ahead of market consensus by $1.03 billion. Here are some comments from Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings call for Q4 2023:\n\nThis infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It’s a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You’ve heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is another leading global tech company that designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, smartphones, and other wearable devices. Apple Inc.

        "title": "20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will be navigating through global homelessness while covering the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World.\n\nOverview of Global Homelessness\n\nAs reported by the United Nations, homelessness is the deprivation of stable, safe, and adequate housing without being able to obtain it. The concept extends from a lack of physical shelter to social exclusion. Homeless groups include people living in open spaces, streets, temporary emergency accommodations, shelters, camps, as well as informal settlements.\n\nThe World Economic Forum reports that approximately 150 million people were homeless around the world in 2021. This equates to 2% of the global population without considering the fact that this doesn’t represent real statistics since measuring homelessness is daunting. The global pandemic worsened the state of homelessness worldwide. This was when economies struggled against the lasting impacts of lockdowns and soaring poverty. In this regard, countries have been fighting their battles against homelessness. While modular mini-homes were provided to the homeless in the UK, shipping containers were used to make an apartment complex for the homeless residing in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nHomelessness: A Univeral Fight\n\nThe United Nations has referred to homelessness as a harmful form of systemic discrimination that impacts people in both developed and developing countries. Previously, we have also discussed the countries with the highest homeless population. Representing developing countries and China, Guyana’s representative exclaimed that homelessness has experienced a rise over the years. In African nations such as Angola, rural poverty primarily drives homelessness. Apart from social inequality and poverty, climate change serves as another cause of homelessness. Small island developing states have been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and storms which massively destroy the social infrastructure while displacing many. Temporary housing and relocation assistance become crucial ways to address disaster-related displacement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the developed United States also continues to find ways to tackle the homeless crisis in the country. On March 22, Reuters reported that more than 653,000 people in America were homeless in 2023, recording a 12% year-over-year increase since 2022. Diverse strategies are being proposed to combat this homelessness. While legislation related to banning people from camping on city sidewalks, parks, and public places was signed in Florida, more than $20 billion has been spent on housing and homelessness programs in California since 2018. Policy experts are of the opinion that access to affordable housing is a better solution rather than clearances that cannot function for a long time. In conclusion, the opposition between a crackdown on camping and raising funding to accommodate the homeless continues across the nation. You can also view the states with the highest homeless population and the cities with the largest homeless populations in the US to have a better understanding of homelessness in the country.\n\nMultinationals Combating Homelessness\n\nBuilding upon the rising crisis of homelessness penetrating America, local companies continue to address the issue. American companies engaging in the nation’s battle against homelessness include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThe e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) caters to housing affordability and accessibility issues, especially for the deprived.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in March",
        "content": "If you’re searching for cheap blue-chip stocks to buy, look no further. Blue-chip stocks continue to lag the performance of growth stocks. Although it is currently at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprised of 30 blue-chip names, is up only 4% this year compared to an 11% gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq index. While some blue-chip stocks are performing strongly, many well-known companies are seeing their share price slide lower and badly lagging the market’s overall performance. The declines, while notable, should be seen as a buying opportunity in many instances.\n\nSome of the stocks that are down this year are struggling with short-term issues that are beyond the company’s control. In time, the situation should resolve itself and the share price should move higher. It’s also good to have blue-chip stocks in one’s portfolio as these securities can be defensive in times when the market drops or the economy falters. Plus, stalwart blue-chip stocks are more likely to pay dividends than fast-growing tech stocks and start-up companies. Buying when prices are down and riding them higher should be the goal of every investor.\n\nHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy at or near their 52-week low in March.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: McDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nThe Golden Arches is as blue-chip as stocks come. The hamburger and restaurant chain has been a reliable performer for decades, trades at a reasonable 24 times future earnings estimates, and pays a quarterly dividend that yields a strong 2.40%. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend payment every year since 1976. Yet MCD stock has struggled in recent years. Year-to-date (YTD), the share price is down 6%. Over five years, it is up only 45%.\n\nThe softness in MCD stock is curious given that the company is in the midst of an aggressive growth strategy, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. McDonald’s also continues to diversify its menu, recently announcing that it will sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its more than 13,500 restaurants across America.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while news of the Krispy Kreme partnership sent DNUT stock up 30% in one day, it barely moved the needle on MCD stock. Time to buy the dip.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nArguably the best deal in the market right now is the stock of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics giant’s share price is down nearly 10% on the year and not far from its 52-week low. Slowing sales in China and an antirust lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Justice Department have pushed AAPL stock down since the start of the year. Smart investors will treat the decline as a buying opportunity.\n\nDespite the headwinds it faces, Apple continues to keep its business chugging along. In recent weeks, the company announced that it plans to start selling its new Vision Pro augmented reality headset in China. Also, Apple is reportedly in talks to license Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and integrate it into future iPhones.\n\nThe addition of AI sets up iPhone for potentially its biggest upgrade in years and could give the smartphone a whole new competitive advantage.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nA huge buy-the-dip opportunity has opened up with the stock of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) after the company’s latest earnings print. LULU stock fell more than 10% after the retailer issued weak forward guidance and said that its North American sales are slowing. The post-earnings decline has dragged the share price 23% lower year to date. However, this popular athletic apparel maker’s stock is not likely to be down for long.\n\nWhile it is true that Lululemon’s North American sales have decelerated, the company is killing it with its international expansion. For the final quarter of 2023, the company’s international sales grew 54% year-over-year, with sales in the key market of China increasing 78%. Lululemon’s total sales, North America included, were up 16% from a year ago. The strong international growth and overall growth are not reflected in LULU stock.\n\nLululemon also continues to expand beyond its traditional focus on women consumers, moving into men’s wear and launching in February a new line of men’s sneakers. Sneakers and casual footwear, both men’s and women’s, represent a huge new market for Lululemon Athletica.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nCan software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) survive an existential threat posed by AI? That’s the question facing the company as its share price has fallen 13% so far in 2024. ADBE stock began to sink after privately held OpenAI launched a new text-to-video generator that competes against its own creative software products that include Photoshop and Illustrator. The situation hasn’t been helped by Adobe’s latest earnings print.\n\nAdobe offered up forward guidance that disappointed analysts on Wall Street. The company also got dinged for canceling its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee. The guidance and Figma fee overshadowed the fact that Adobe reported strong financial results that beat analyst forecasts. The company also announced a $25 billion stock buyback program.\n\nAdobe is not taking the threat from OpenAI and other competitors lying down. Over the last year, the company has added AI features to many of its software products, including an image editing tool called Firefly.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Hershey (HSY) The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.\n\nSource: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re heading into the Easter long weekend, and one would assume that this would be a great time to be a shareholder of Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY). After all, Americans spent $3.3 billion on Easter chocolate and candy in 2023, up 8.2% from the previous year. Sadly though, there is not much reason to celebrate the Easter Bunny’s arrival this year. Not with cocoa prices trading at an all-time high and above $10,000 per metric ton for the first time ever.\n\nRecord prices for cocoa is a huge problem for Hershey, which spends more than $1 billion a year on the active ingredient in chocolate. Cocoa prices have risen 40% this year due to global supply constraints. The problem lies in the Ivory Coast of Africa, which is the biggest cocoa producer in the world. The region has been hit by both flooding and hotter-than-usual temperatures that are causing drought conditions and diminishing crop yields.\n\nThe flooding and excessive heat has also led to an outbreak of cacao swollen shoot virus that is harming the cocoa crop. The world’s supply of cocoa is now on course for a third straight annual supply deficit. The worsening problem has HSY stock down 24% over the last 12 months and not far from its 52-week low. But long-term, Hershey remains a solid investment. Here’s hoping cocoa prices move lower before Halloween.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re barely through one quarter of the year, and already 2024 has been tough on pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). In early January, the company cut its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%, sending WBA stock plunging. Then, the company was kicked out of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further hurting its share price.\n\nThe net effect is that WBA stock is down 23% on the year. That brings its 12-month decline to nearly 40%. While things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and preserve cash.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens’ most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow low can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock go? A lot lower according to analysts who cover the company. Down nearly 30% on the year, TSLA stock is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 index. However, each day seems to bring a new analyst downgrade for the stock. Most recently, analysts at Bernstein lowered their price target on Tesla’s shares to $120 from $150 and reiterated a “sell” equivalent rating.\n\nBernstein, and others, are worried about slumping global demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles, especially in China. They’re also seeing weak demand for Tesla’s Model 3 electric vehicle stateside. The piling on has hurt investor sentiment related to TSLA stock and pushed the share price lower. Approaching a 52-week low, and with its market capitalization sliding to $500 billion, its fair to wonder, what’s next for Tesla?\n\nDespite the glum situation, there’s every reason for investors to buy-the-dip in TSLA stock. The company is taking steps to right the ship, including raising prices and offering a free trial of its full self-driving feature. Also, the stock has fallen sharply in the past and always comes roaring back. This time is likely to be no different.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

        "title": "13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 high growth value stocks to invest in according to Seth Klarman. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and an introduction to Klarman's investing history, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman.\n\nOne of the more well known investment strategies on Wall Street, which has also seen some of the most professional investors attest to its success is value investing. When compared to today's high frequency trading and quantitative model based stock market trading environment, value investment is a classical approach that evaluates whether a firm's underlying fundamentals and business models can cause share price appreciation in the future.\n\nTwo of the most well known value investors of our time are Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of the Buapost Group. Buffett's Berkshire is one of the biggest investment holding companies in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that the combined value of its 13F investments as of December 2023 end was a whopping $347 billion. As part of our regular coverage of hedge fund investments, Insider Monkey also analyzed Berkshire's Q4 2023 investment portfolio as part of our coverage of Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 12 Stock Picks. You can take a look at the portfolio by clicking on the link, but the top three picks were American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAnother follower of value investing is Seth Klarman. His hedge fund had $4.5 in Q4 2023 holdings, and some of the biggest positions were technology companies such as Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). So what is value investing? Well, the key principle of this strategy is determining the fair value of stock and comparing it with the market price through a metric called the margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the fair value and the market price, and the greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels in betting their money on an equity.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like we have done with Buffett's investments, we also took a look at Klarman's value stock picks. The latest such coverage was 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman), and the top three stocks in this list were Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). Since it's March 2024, it's important to see how well these stocks have performed over the past six months since they were disclosed by Baupost for Q3 2023. Well, the three stocks' share price performance over the past six months has been 27.73%, 27%, and 26%. Interestingly, all three of Klarman's top value stock picks in Q3 are up by 26% or 27%, despite the fact that these are relatively stable companies with few catchy products like NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPU.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the high growth value stock picks of Seth Klarman, Warren Buffett's latest letter to Berkshire shareholders also features some hidden gems for value investing. In his letter, Buffett shares:\n\nSpeed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school.\n\nThese seizures are the perfect opportunity for value investing since they can open up large differentials between the fair value and the market price. Buffett's long history of trading has also seen him capitalize on such seizures early in his career, with perhaps the most notable being his trifles with the shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at Seth Klarman's top high growth value stocks. A couple of notable names are Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman\n\nSeth Klarman of Baupost Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Seth Klarman's high growth value stocks, we ranked all stocks in Baupost Group's Q4 2023 investment portfolio by their 3-year average revenue growth rate (5-year if the 3-year estimate was in the red) and picked the top stocks. The revenue growth data was sourced from Morningstar Financial.\n\nFor these high growth value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\n\nThe United States economy has been hit hard by inflation concerns in the past two years, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates in a bid to curb surging prices. Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\n\nCoupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\n\nDespite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy. Benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have rocketed since the start of the new year. The former is up nearly 9% year-to-date and the latter has grown by more than 10%. Key stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also surging, the first two registering returns of 10.3% and 92% since the turn of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA prominent theme for growth this year is artificial intelligence. Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently highlighted the steps that the firm was taking to emerge as a leader in this space. During the fourth quarter earnings call, Huang called the present AI boom an inflection point that had triggered a sense of urgency at the enterprise level to develop strategies in the AI world. He cautioned, however, that the AI supercomputer infrastructure and model algorithms remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\n\n“I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software, or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and others on the way.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

(NYSE:C), compared to 79 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Silver Beech Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Citigroup (“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.\n\nAs a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.\n\nCiti’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n14. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)operates as a diversified software company worldwide. On January 2, investment advisory Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and raised the price target to $705 from $650.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 4.5 million shares worth more than $2.7 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payments technology firm. On January 27, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and raised the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $26.5 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 167 in the preceding quarter worth $24.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.\n\nPeople carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they’ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren’t going to get paid…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 83\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides travel and restaurant online reservation and related services worldwide. On February 26, investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and raised the price target to $4,100 from $3,677.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), compared to 81 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) and raised the price target to $235 from $200.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10.

(NYSE:PFE) with 11.6 million shares worth more than $334 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.”\n\n8. Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 in the preceding quarter worth $35 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, SaltLight Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc., (META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”\n\n6. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s overseas suppliers have ramped up production of the company’s long-anticipated new iPads and a launch is planned for early May, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla’s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Bankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX Collapse Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians London Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions UBS Banker’s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate Finance\n\nThe release will center on revamped versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.\n\nThe move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.\n\nAfter a run-up during the pandemic, iPad sales have fallen in each of Apple’s last two fiscal years, which run through September. They suffered an additional 25% year-over-year decline during the latest holiday period, when the devices have typically been popular gifts.\n\nA spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe iPad Pro models — codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 — will run the new M3 chip and work with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The update represents the first overhaul to that lineup since 2018.\n\nThe iPad Air, meanwhile, was last updated in 2022 with the M1 chip. It will get a new processor, and the 12.9-screen size means consumers can get a large iPad for less money than the more upscale Pro. The current iPad Air starts at $599, while the Pro line costs $200 more.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices. The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.\n\nAn early May product release would come about a month before Apple’s next major event. On June 10, the company plans to kick off its weeklong Worldwide Developers Conference. There, Apple is expected to unveil a renewed artificial intelligence strategy — alongside software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and Vision Pro headset.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving The Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "title": "Xiaomi Enters Cutthroat EV Race With $29,900 SU7 Series",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp. is kicking off sales of its first electric vehicles with aggressive pricing, betting the Chinese smartphone maker can succeed in a cutthroat market where Apple Inc. faltered.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians China Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest Banks Japan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990\n\nCo-founder Lei Jun presented his strategy in Beijing Thursday evening with the base SU7 model costing 215,900 yuan ($29,900) and prices stretching up to 299,900 yuan for the SU7 Max. Xiaomi aims to begin mass deliveries by the end of April and is sweetening the deal for early orders with additional freebies like a built-in fridge.\n\nThese vehicles are the culmination of a multiyear undertaking with a $10 billion budget and lofty expectations. Xiaomi benchmarked itself against Tesla Inc.’s Model 3 in most respects and sought to match the electric Porsche Taycan with its top-performance edition, Lei said.\n\nLei’s announcement of the SU7 range and launch date triggered a surge in Xiaomi’s shares this month — even without the disclosure of pricing. Investors cheered the diversification away from the stagnant smartphone business, but Xiaomi still has much to prove as it enters a wholly new product category.\n\nLike Apple in the US, Xiaomi saw the opportunity to expand into EVs at a time that cars were adding more electronics and connectivity — though Apple canceled its car project in February, while the Chinese firm is proceeding.\n\n“I didn’t expect Apple to quit,” Lei said on stage in Beijing, before an audience of tens of millions across Chinese streaming platforms. After diving into the details of his cars’ design and engineering — from nine different color options to a laptop-friendly glove box and triple-layer UV protection in the windshield — the CEO returned to the topic of his smartphone-making rival. “Xiaomi will support Apple users just as well,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTurquoise-blue models of the new vehicles have been on display in Xiaomi stores across China this week, giving customers an early look. The company’s shares rose 1.2% in Hong Kong on Thursday ahead of the price reveal. The CEOs of fellow Chinese automakers Xpeng Inc., Nio Inc. and Li Auto Inc. and the chairs of BAIC Motor Corp. and Great Wall Motor Co. were in attendance and acknowledged as friends by Lei.\n\nThe global EV market, once a booming sector with vast subsidy-assisted opportunity, has turned into a highly competitive arena. Tesla and BYD Co. dominate in China, the largest individual market, and are fighting a price war that’s putting pressure on smaller players. Xiaomi hopes to draw away domestic consumers with its offering, which was conceived by a team led by former BMW AG designer Tianyuan Li and had consulting help from Chris Bangle, formerly of BMW and Fiat SpA.\n\nBeijing-based Xiaomi is looking for the next stage of its evolution, having grown into one of the world’s top three smartphone makers with a strategy of selling low-margin, high-spec devices online.\n\nOne example of a tech company making a successful EV foray comes from Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecommunications conglomerate, which is providing technology solutions to carmakers and displaying the Aito EVs in its stores.\n\nRead More: Xiaomi Unveils EV in Bid to Become China’s Porsche or Tesla\n\nTo avoid delays in obtaining regulatory approval, Xiaomi partnered with state-owned Beijing Automotive Group Co. for the new vehicles. The cars are going on sale in 59 stores across 29 Chinese cities.\n\nInitiated three years ago, Lei has called the EV endeavor his final entrepreneurial bet and has dedicated most of his attention to it in recent times. Xiaomi aspires to become a top global carmaker in 15 to 20 years, Lei said when he first unveiled the SU7 in December. President Lu Weibing has added that the company’s goal is to have one of China’s three best-selling luxury EV models.\n\nThe ambitious EV bet arrives at a time of slowing growth for China’s electric car purchases. Industry bodies project 25% growth in sales for 2024, down from 36% last year and 96% in 2022.\n\n(Updates with details from Xiaomi’s presentation from second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Oregon’s new right to repair law bans ‘parts pairing’ in defiance of Apple",
        "content": "As we reported a week ago, new United Nations data shows that people are creating electronic waste at a rate five times greater than that for e-waste collection and recycling. Well, here’s something that should help the pushback against this alarming, wasteful trend.\n\nYesterday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek signed into law the newest and toughest right-to-repair act in the U.S. This is the fourth such state law in the country, and it goes even further than California’s good effort last October, in particular by resisting Apple’s lobbying and banning the use of “parts pairing” to hinder independent repair services.\n\nParts pairing is when an electronics manufacturer digitally pairs a component’s serial number to that of the machine it goes into. So, in the case of an iPhone, an Apple-made battery taken from a smashed-up handset can’t simply be swapped into another iPhone that needs it, without triggering scary warning messages about potentially unofficial parts. A swapped-in selfie camera won’t work properly, despite being an official Apple part. Same goes for a screen, which may not be able to have its brightness adjusted, for no good reason.\n\nAs the New York Times reported last year, this tactic has made Apple billions of dollars, by steering customers towards the pricey AppleCare insurance policy, under which the company will repair screens and replace batteries. So it’s no surprise that Apple tried to convince Oregon lawmakers not to ban the practice, telling them that the move would “undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin and consumer devices.”\n\nWell, that didn’t work. Oregon’s Right to Repair Act passed each stage of the legislative process comfortably. For any devices sold after the start of next year, manufacturers won’t be allowed to use parts pairing to reduce a device’s functionality or performance, or to “display misleading alerts or warnings…about unidentified parts,” or to stop any device owner or independent repair business from installing a perfectly functioning part. (Other parts of the law, such as those requiring manufacturers to allow people to fix their own devices, apply to stuff that was sold after mid-2015, or mid-2021 in the case of smartphones specifically.)\n\nStory continues\n\n“By keeping products running and off the scrap heap, repair cuts waste and saves consumers money,” said Nathan Proctor, right-to-repair campaign chief at the Public Interest Research Group, which aided the campaign for the law in Oregon. “People are tired of not being able to fix things. Lawmakers have gotten the message and, in turn, are sending that message to the manufacturers.”\n\nIncidentally, while Apple opposed the parts-pairing shift, smartphone rival Google did not. Indeed, its devices operations chief Steven Nickel earlier this year wrote an open letter supporting the bill, saying it “requires that as manufacturers we design products in a manner that enables simple, safe, and correct repairs wherever and by whomever they are done,” adding: “This is what we call design for serviceability.”\n\nMore news below.

        "title": "Zscaler Is Attractively Valued Amid Growing Digital Reliance",
        "content": "Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has one of the highest growth rates in its industry, based on my analysis of dominant peers. As such, I consider it a significant investment in artificieal intelligecne-integrated cybersecurity, with a particular moat in how it protects cloud operations. However, fast-changing digital landscapes, as they relate to the increased abilities of AI, could pose significant risks for shareholders. This needs to be monitored carefully.\n\nOverview of operations\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.\n\nFounded in 2007, the company describes itself as the world's largest any-to-any security cloud platform. Its most valuable operational asset at this time is the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which is a cybersecurity suite that operates under the fundamental tenet of trusting no one and verifying everything. This model treats all users and devices as potential threats, whether they are inside or outside of a network. The platform is cloud-native, meaning it is built and run on the cloud, which facilitates better scalability, performance and security.\n\nI believe this technology is particularly important at a time when work environments are becoming increasingly hybridized, with some organizations opting for fully remote working conditions. Increased cybersecurity as a result of the high load of digital transactions of often sensitive data requires advanced systems of protection against data extraction, malware and other corruption of digital workflows.\n\nZscaler has countless technology partners, including Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Slack (WORK). For example, with Microsoft, Szcaler is integrated into Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender. With Amazon Web Services, the integration of Zscaler improves the security of digital transformation, most significantly for organizations leveraging its cloud infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition\n\nOf Zscaler's competitors, and there are many, a few notable ones stand out to me as being potentially the biggest threats:\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW): I consider it to be the most significant competitor as the company has a wide range of security solutions, including advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings. Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO): The most well-financed peer, the company has an extensive range of security products, such as firewalls, VPNs and advanced malware protection. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT): The company covers everything from firewalls to secure SD-WAN, which manages traffic across wide area networks for higher efficiency.\n\nIt is useful for us to put these four peers into proper perspective based on some of the core financial metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet IPO 2018 2012 1990 2009 Market Cap $29.22 B $92.71 B $201.53 B $52.1 B Equity-to-Asset 0.24 0.24 0.46 -0.06 Net Margin -7.32% 30.24% 23.49% 21.64% 3Y Rev Growth Rate 49.6% 19.8% 6.2% 29.6% FWD PE Ratio 82 56 13.4 40\n\nIt is quite evident to me that Zscaler has particular appeal compared to some of the newer players, namely Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, as it shows higher growth. I believe, as is the case with most excellent companies that last over the long term, it will manage to stabilize its profitability. This is already somewhat evident in that its median net margin over the past 10 years is -26.69%, but, over time, it has reined this in to -7.32%.\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks looks like a compelling alternative investment, Zscaler is more attractive by and large, in my opinion. Palo Alto Networks has a strong acquisition strategy, including CloudGenix in 2020 and Twistlock in 2019, and a diverse product portfolio, including its Prisma cloud and Cortex AI security platform. But Zscaler's portfolio looks stronger and it has also made multiple high-status acquisitions, bolstering its five key areas of operation that act as a simple framework for enterprise partnerships. Among these are:\n\nZscaler Internet Access: Efficient in secure internet and SaaS application access, replacing traditional VPN and firewall technology. Zscaler Private Access: Access to private applications securely, without a VPN, without bringing users onto the internet. Zscaler Cloud Protection: Provides security for public cloud environments. Zscaler Digital Experience: A comprehensive monitoring solution that ensures optimal user experience of Zscaler tools while also optimizing security.\n\nIn short, Zscaler offers a one-point solution with some of the most advanced technology on the market, which I think outperforms Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and Fortinet operationally in many areas, specifically as it relates to cloud security and simplicity in these operations.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nZscaler's growth is hinged on the widely anticipated expansion of the broader digital services market, particularly the managed services market, which includes managed data centers, security, network and infrastructure services. Mordor Intelligence estimates this will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029. It attributes factors such as an increasing shift to hybrid IT, improved cost and operational efficiency demand and rising IT complexity as core drivers of this market growth. My own opinion is that the market as it relates to Zscaler will grow faster than this, even more so than Mordor's estimate of an 11.44% CAGR for the cybersecurity market from 2024 to 2029. My own estimate is around a 15% CAGR over the next decade, as my belief is the adoption of cloud services, hybrid and remote working and demand for advanced digital services and associated security will increase exponentially as AI proliferates the mainstream more readily, driving new business models that are more operationally digital due to cost-effectiveness, a higher amount of self-employed and independent contractors and a lower reliance on human labor in general as functions become more reliably automated.\n\nThis is a very interesting time to be in the job market, as I believe we are going to see faster change than we ever have in history, and people will have to be quick to react to shifting labor demands. That being said, one constant seems to ring true, which is that most, if not all, of these labor demands will be significantly dependent on digital workflows and associated data protection and security, which will be highly beneficial for companies like Zscaler.\n\nValuation\n\nSuccessfully valuing Zscaler based on earnings is difficult because of how early on it is in its development. As this is the case, I have opted to analyzes its price-to-free cash flow ratio relative to peers instead. I have also looked at the company's price-to-operating cash flow ratio against peers for the same reason. First of all, consider each of the four peers compared based on the two valuation metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet P/FCF 57 34.5 15 31 P/OCF 44 33 14 28\n\nZscaler is quite clearly the highest valued of the four, but investors should consider that its valuation has come down considerably in the last few years. Its median price-to-free cash flow ratio over the past 10 years is 221.75, indicating a 74.10% discount from the historical valuation. Additionally, its price-to-operating cash flow median over the past 10 years is 132.90, indicating a 66.60% discount from the historical valuation.\n\nConsidering analysts expect, on consensus, an earnings per share without non-recurring items CAGR of 31.17% over the next three years, I believe the present valuation shows a significantly strong price and an attractive entry point despite trading at a premium to the three peers. We must remember that Palo Alto Networks has a much lower forecasted CAGR over the next three years of 17.05%, hence the lower premium in the valuation attributed by the market.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is evidently a risk that Zscaler will be outcompeted by other cybersecurity companies that develop, and it appears that there is not a concentrated monopoly in cybersecurity at this time. As such, there is, in some sense, an arms race toward that monopoly in AI-led cybersecurity, similar to how Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have a duopoly in software and hardware. Zscaler investors should watch the market carefully, as there may come a time in the not-too-distant future when it makes sense to sell the stake for another provider if it becomes clear the balance of power has begun to shift.\n\nAdditionally, along similar lines, as AI becomes more powerful and we reach unprecedented capabilities, it is quite possible the cybersecurity and digital landscapes shift considerably. What is now cutting-edge, the cloud, could in the future become outdated and Zscaler has an enormous task at hand in keeping up to date with the rapid shifts that are likely to happen in the AI and associated cybersecurity industries. The company has a large ecosystem with partners and connections in the industry that provide it with some moat in this regard in terms of operational collaboration and financing capabilities, but investors must be aware of the risk of rapid change.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom my research, I believe Zscaler to be one of the best investments in cybersecurity currently, but the markets are shifting quickly. Nonetheless, I believe now is a prudent time to consider the stock due to the favorable valuation and high growth expected by analysts. My research into market drivers bodes very well for the company's long-term future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on the podium for being among the most well-known, highest-market capitalized and profitable companies in the world. It generally needs no introduction, but as it says in its 10-K filing:\n\n\"Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple's five software platforms iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\"\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.\n\nAt its core, the company has this double strategy of manufacturing and selling both the hardware (PCs, tablets, smartphones and accessories) as well as the software.\n\nSegment breakdown\n\nThe company is divided in to two main businesses: Products (basically hardware) and Services, which make up the huge $383 billion in revenue. Apple further divides its business into five categories. The iPhone has the lion share of it all with 52.20% of net sales, followed by Services (22.20%) and then the other hardware/products, Wearable, Home and Accessories (10.40%), Mac (7.60%) and iPad (7.40%).\n\nWhat does Apple mean by services, exactly? Well, the list is long and chances are you know them all, but they encompass advertising (including third-party licensing arrangements and the company's own advertising platforms), AppleCare (a portfolio of fee-based service and support products), Cloud Services (with interactions also with Windows personal computers), Digital Content (App Store, etc.), subscription-based services (including Apple Arcade for games, Apple Fitness+SM for personalized fitness, Apple Music, Apple News+ and Apple TV+ with exclusive original content and live sports ever expanding). Last but not least are Payment Services (including Apple Card, a co-branded credit card not yet available in Italy, and Apple Pay, a cashless payment service based on NFC technology).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe newest of these services is Apple Sports, which was launched in February. The free app provides real-time scores for sporting events, key statistics and betting odds. Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down\n\nSource: Apple's official website.\n\nThis vast segment as a whole represents one of the most promising growth factors due to the loyalty of Apple's user base with various estimates ranging around 80% and a high user retention of around 90%.\n\nThis is a key factor as the hardware part of the company is approaching its saturation (especially referring to iPhones). As CEO Tim Cook noted in the company's latest earnings release:\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.\"\n\nWhy all the fuss about services?\n\nTaking a closer look at Apple's margins for its services, the results are eye-watering. A 70% gross margin is quite impressive for a category still considered to be in its growth phase. Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down\n\nSource: Apple's 10-K.\n\nIt is also important to mention the tech giant's global footprint. Over the past three years, it has made around half of its sales from outside the Americas. This means $93 billion from Europe, plus $72 billion from China, $24 billion from Japan and $29 billion from the rest of Asia Pacific in the last fiscal year alone. Attached to the wide diversity in its cash streams is the sensitivity the company has to foreign exchange fluctuations, which can be estimated to be around 3%. Do remember that a stronger U.S. dollar leads to lower sales, all other factors being equal.\n\nThis is a strong point against those saying the company is American. Rather, one could argue it is a truly global company.\n\nFuture developments\n\nWhat about AI?\n\nI am not sure what Apple's future holds in respect to artificial intelligence, but some key factors to consider should be the fact the company has a proven track record of innovation, an abundance of cash resources ($61.50 billion as per the most recent fiscal year), a high rate of strategic acquisitions (reported to have acquired more than 30 AI companies in 2023) and the availability of massive data sets to train machine learning algorithms.\n\nVisionPro anyone?\n\nAs for the VisionPro headset, I am not pricing this fancy new virtual reality product into the valuation yet. The motivation is twofold: (a) I have not used it yet and (b) I do not fully understand its true potential, nor does the general public. Will it be like the iPhone back in 2007 when it launched and Steve Ballmer famously laughed at its high price tag (around $500) with the then-unthinkable lack of a physical keyboard?\n\nPrepare to discover it!\n\nRisks\n\nAs is always the case with tech companies, Apple is facing several risks in both the short term and long term.\n\nSome new risks regard the increasing probability of opening up the App Store (as per legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, the anticompetitive investigation around Epic Games and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)), but also the growing and sticky China restrictions (as in the sales of iPhones).\n\nLast but not least, the crowded smartphone industry, especially with Asian companies (notably the fierce competition from Samsung (XKRX: 005930), which recently already added AI capabilities to its new Galaxy S24 device).\n\nValuation\n\nIt is not easy to value the stock. Since one of the company's major characteristics is its record-breaking market capitalization ($2.62 trillion as of the time of writing), valuation by comparison is quite impractical. It would mean making a lot of assumptions (e.g., economy of scale, tangibleness of business model), hence potentially invalidating the results. Apple has definitely maintained a solid balance sheet since its founding, but lately this trend has been inverting.\n\nSince 2019, some common financial strength ratios have decreased, in particular due to declining cash and equivalents and short-term investments, to the tune of $39 billion over a five-year period. Accumulating liquidity forever was obviously a synonym for poor usage of resources and a non-desired goal. The time came to put this huge pile of cash to work during the final years of the Covid-19 pandemic as inflation and increased competition impacted tech stocks.\n\nThe sterile financial ratios, with a current ratio of 0.98 and a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.68, only tell one side of the story. On the flip side, Apple managed to post sound business performance with a 59% increase in cash from operations and an even more impressive 68% surge in free cash flow over the same period from 2019 to 2023. Also beware that wise usage of funds has been a distinctive feature of Apple that averaged a return on invested capital of 25% in the last decade, never posting a single-digit figure in this metric.\n\nGiven all that, I base my valuation on free cash flow and its trend over the past five years, starting from a value of $105 billion. Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down\n\nSource: Author's calculations.\n\nThe company uses it cash mostly to repurchase shares. During 2023, $76.60 billion worth of common stock was repurchased and it paid $15 billion in dividends. The current dividend yield is quite low at 0.50%. Not only is this good fiscally, but also for shareholders.\n\nI imputed different growth rates for year one to five and six to 10, as well as different discount rates and terminal value multiples according to five hypothesized Mr. Market manic-depression moods. With respect to the broader enterprise value, the results are surprising.\n\nThere is no one scenario in which Apple can comfortably be viewed as on sale or a possible buy.\n\nAssuming the 15.80 billion in fully diluted shares outstanding, the overvaluation ranges between 10% and 74%. Apple: A Compounding Machine Slowing Down\n\nSource: Author's calculations.\n\nThe market is currently giving the stock a price-earnings ratio in line with the average for the hardware industry of 26, but much more weight is given to the sales, as shown by the high price-sales ratio of 6.93.\n\nConclusion\n\nSometimes it is better to buy great companies at fair prices than the other way around (credits to the late Charlie Munger). This time I do not feel comfortable about the fair price even though I consider Apple to be great. The stock can be considered overvalued currently.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Are you looking for quality dividend stocks to hold in your portfolio? You may be tempted to look at financial stocks, defensive stocks, or simply businesses that are more closely associated with safety rather than growth potential. But growth stocks can make for potentially underrated income investments, especially in tech.\n\nAccording to the most recent issue of the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, the top two dividend payers, in terms of actual cash paid out last year, were Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Although they don't offer the highest yields, these companies have been paying a ton in dividends. And in the long run, they could become great dividend growth stocks.\n\nMicrosoft: $20.7 billion\n\nTech giant Microsoft paid out the most in dividends last year, with a generous $20.7 billion paid out to its shareholders over its most recent four quarters. The company has routinely been on the list of the top dividend payers, and it has occupied one of the top three spots in each of the past four years.\n\nYou might be surprised that the stock ranks so highly given that Microsoft's yield looks incredibly underwhelming at just 0.7%, which is far below the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.\n\nBut with the company having more than 7.4 billion shares outstanding and its current dividend now paying investors $3 per share over the course of a year, it's easy to see how that tally can get so high in a hurry. The yield, after all, is simply a function of the dividend per share divided by the stock price. And with Microsoft's stock trading north of $420, a $3 dividend isn't going to represent a big percentage of the price.\n\nMicrosoft's payout ratio is only 25% and there's plenty of room for the company to get bigger, especially since Microsoft anticipates that its top line could grow by $10 billion annually simply due to artificial intelligence. Plus, with its acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard now complete, it has also strengthened its growth opportunities in gaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant has generated $82.5 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months on revenue of $227.6 billion. With exceptional financial numbers and still a lot of growth left, this can be an excellent dividend stock to buy and hold for not only years but decades. Microsoft has been increasing its dividend for nearly 20 straight years.\n\nApple: $15.1 billion\n\nApple is a bit of a distant second on the list, paying shareholders $15.1 billion last year, but it was still good enough for second place. Like Microsoft, it's not uncommon to find Apple's name among the list of top dividend-paying companies. Apple has 15.4 billion shares outstanding and pays out $0.96 in dividends per share over the course of a year.\n\nApple's business has been transitioning more toward services in recent years, which can be a great way for the company to upsell existing customers. Whether it's music, streaming, news, fitness, or other subscription options, there are many ways for Apple to deliver some additional value to its nearly 1.5 billion active iPhone users in the world.\n\nThe company is still focusing on growth initiatives as well. There are rumors it is working on its own chatbot some are calling \"Apple GPT,\" which could lead to yet another subscription opportunity for the business. Apple's Vision Pro headset is another potential growth driver in the future, and it may be a way to enhance existing apps and services. The business still has plenty of room to get bigger in the years ahead, and the dividend that income investors receive is likely to grow as well.\n\nOver the past 12 months, Apple has generated $385.7 billion in revenue and $100.9 billion in profit. Its payout ratio of 15% is even lower than Microsoft's. Its 0.6% yield, however, is also slightly lower. But the company has been regularly increasing its dividend payments since 2013 and with a boatload of profit, plenty of more growth opportunities, and an incredibly low payout ratio, this is another underrated dividend growth stock income investors shouldn't overlook.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Global smartphone shipments are expected to rebound 3% this year as easing inflation aids a demand recovery in emerging markets and the integration of generative AI attracts buyers to premium devices, a report by Counterpoint Research said on Thursday.\n\nGlobal shipments had declined more than 4% last year, earlier data from the research firm showed, as consumers tightened their purse strings in an uncertain economy.\n\nEmerging markets such as India, the Middle East and Africa are seen to be major growth drivers for the smartphone market, especially the budget-economy segment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe budget segment, expected to grow 11% in 2024 after shrinking in 2023, will also see increasing demand in the Caribbean and Latin American regions.\n\nThe segment, consisting of phones priced between $150 and $249, is set to benefit from easing inflation in regions such as Africa and stabilization of local currencies, Counterpoint said.\n\nIncreased competition between Chinese companies such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, along with a recovery in demand for IT devices, also aided growth in the segment.\n\nThe premium segment, with phones priced between $600 and $799, is expected to grow 17%. The introduction of much-coveted genAI technology and the popularity of foldables will stimulate demand for this segment, the report said.\n\nApple and Chinese rival Huawei are likely to emerge as winners in the premium market, it said.\n\nSteady demand for iPhones, particularly in emerging markets, is set to benefit Apple, while Huawei is expected to retain its strong presence in China, especially with the release of its 5G Kirin chipset, the report stated.\n\nCompetition from Huawei led to a 24% decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of 2024, Counterpoint had estimated earlier.\n\nSeparately, Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone, according to media reports from earlier in March.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Thinks Nvidia Could End Up Like Cisco After the Dot-Com Crash. Here's the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That I'm More Worried About.",
        "content": "One of the most outspoken investors on Wall Street is Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest. Wood is best known for making big bets in emerging areas of technology and healthcare.\n\nIn a shareholder letter published earlier this month, she suggested that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could end up like Cisco in the aftermath of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.\n\nGiven the meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock price over the last year, it's reasonable to believe a pullback could be on the horizon. But calling for a crash akin to Cisco? That seems dramatic.\n\nInstead, I think a different \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could be at risk of falling out of favor with investors. Let's dig into why I see Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as much more likely to follow in Cisco's footsteps.\n\nSolving latent needs\n\nLatent needs are an interesting concept. Simply put, a latent need is a problem that people don't even realize they have.\n\nApple is the king of solving latent needs. With the iPod, iMac, iPhone, iPad, and AirPods, the company revolutionized personal computing, communications, and entertainment in ways that people didn't even realize were needed.\n\nThe company's long list of innovative hardware made it one of the most recognized brands around the world. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe artificial intelligence race is on\n\nAs investors salivate over all things related to artificial intelligence (AI), Apple is yet again remaining tight-lipped about its plans. I don't think this is the best move after some of the company's flops in recent history.\n\nGiven how quiet the company has been on the innovation front, I think overcommunicating might be an appropriate strategy right now. Sure, it just shipped its virtual reality (VR) headset, the Vision Pro. But for now, I think people are more intrigued by the idea of VR, rather than the actual use of the technology in their daily lives.\n\nAfter years of playing coy, news broke earlier this month that the company was abandoning its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. And big tech cohorts Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all dominate cloud computing -- a movement that Apple missed entirely.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple only recently made headlines in the AI realm following its acquisition of a start-up called DarwinAI. While this deal was interesting, details surrounding how it plans to leverage DarwinAI are sparse.\n\nBy contrast, Nvidia is aggressively entering new AI markets that it can disrupt. For example, the company is an investor in humanoid robotics start-up Figure AI, as well as a partner with enterprise software platform Databricks.\n\nAmong mega-cap tech companies, Nvidia is emerging as the front-runner in AI. Demand is soaring for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia's revenue increased 126% year over year, while profits and free cash flow grew nearly sixfold. On the other hand, Apple's revenue has been in decline for a year as demand for luxury hardware devices has stalled against the backdrop of a tough economy.\n\nThe innovator's dilemma\n\nCisco is one of the most interesting case studies in recent business history. The company was hailed as a leading innovator during the early stages of the internet age. But after competitors began producing similar products, Cisco failed to pivot and move on. Given Nvidia's broad reach across the AI spectrum, I find Wood's comparison to Cisco lacking.\n\nSure, like Cisco back in the late 1990s, Nvidia stock soared to unprecedented levels. But I think the company's momentum is just getting started. The long-term narrative surrounding AI is encouraging, and right now the chipmaker appears to be the engine powering all sorts of applications.\n\nBy contrast, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 -- higher than both Meta Platforms and Alphabet as of the time of this writing. It's tough to justify this premium when the company appears to be at a crossroads. It isn't growing, demand for its products is in decline, it abandoned EV's, and it doesn't appear to have any tangible strategy related to AI.\n\nCould competition ultimately pose a threat to Nvidia? It probably will. But this is why I find the company's investments in robotics and software to be savvy moves. It is clearly exploring markets beyond its core chip business, which will hopefully prove fruitful in the long run.\n\nGiven the amount of unknowns surrounding Apple, I see the company as an enigma right now. As an investor, I'm not concerned about Nvidia's prospects. But given the lack of innovation from Apple for several years, I think there is a real possibility the company could end up in a situation similar to that of Cisco at some point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Energy stocks lead March gains in sign of broadening market rally",
        "content": "March has been a solid month for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) — and an even better one for oil- and gas-related stocks.\n\nAs the month draws to a close, energy has emerged as the top-performing sector. The S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE), which includes oil giants like ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP), has gained more than 9% compared to the benchmark index's rise of nearly 3% in the same period.\n\nThe Energy sector is also one of the biggest winners year to date, behind Communications Services and Information Technology.\n\nEnergy's outsized rise comes as oil futures have climbed more than 13% since the start of 2024. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, were trading near $82 and $86 per barrel, respectively, on Wednesday.\n\nFalling inventories earlier this month, drone attacks against Russian refineries, and continued output cuts from oil alliance OPEC+ have helped move the price of crude futures higher in March.\n\nThis week Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the Energy sector to Overweight from Neutral, noting that earnings could be revised higher. They also cited \"strong breadth and compelling valuation.\"\n\n\"The recent stability of crude prices also points to a catch up in both relative performance and earnings growth, in our view,\" wrote Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson.\n\nThe analyst highlights the firm's forecast of $90 per barrel for Brent by the third quarter due to tighter supply-demand balances.\n\nWilson wrote, \"The divergence between oil prices and the sector's relative performance is likely to close via a catch up in Energy equities.\"\n\nAmong some of the biggest movers: Diamondback Energy (FANG) is up 26%, and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and ExxonMobil are each up roughly 15% year to date. Oil rig and pump of H&P Rig 488 in Stanton, Texas, on June 8, 2023. (SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images) (SUZANNE CORDEIRO via Getty Images)\n\nThe rotation into energy-related stocks marks a reversal from 2023's market action, when XLE ended the year down more than 3% as oil fell 10% from the prior year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe gains this year hint at a broadening of the market rally beyond the Magnificent Seven trade, which itself has shown signs of waning as Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) have lost value this year.\n\n\"We think the Mag Seven is going to become the Lag Seven,\" Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this month.\n\n\"At this point in time, we're going to start to see a broadening out of this market,\" he added.\n\nLast month Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian called for a broadening of the rally by June.\n\nSubramanian's research showed the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to grow earnings by more than the Magnificent Seven in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nApple's tough year just got worse.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem curious that the Justice Department is targeting Apple's power in the smartphone market just as the company is trying to diversify from its marquee hardware. But Apple's eye-popping growth in services — its impressive ability to extract more revenue from the periphery of its ecosystem — drives much of the hostility against it.\n\nSales of the iPhone still account for more than half of Apple's revenue. But the services that tie into the phone are amassing an increasingly important role in the company's business. For some of Apple's more bullish analysts, the promise of the services segment is the narrative fuel behind Cupertino's growth story and a pillar of its $2.6 trillion valuation.\n\nThat also explains the company's strategic predicament. As Apple leans more heavily into generating value by keeping people within its system — from things like App Store commissions and subscriptions — the more scrutiny it draws to its business practices.\n\nThe antitrust suit is the latest challenge weighing on the company's share price, which has flagged in recent months, in part on slowing iPhone sales in China.\n\nTech's growth narrative has finally shifted away from phones/apps to AI, a theme aptly illustrated by Bank of America Global Research analysts who wrote Wednesday that their recent trip to Asia was the first trip in two decades \"where smartphones were barely a part of the conversation.\"\n\nServices might be a long-term financial solution to the waning importance of the iPhone. It's also an invitation for regulators to investigate monopoly power and test the strength of the \"Walled Garden,\" as Apple's closed ecosystem is often called.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Apple, the seamlessness of the iPhone experience reflects the security of its products and the vibrance of its offerings, a message it is counting on Steve Jobs disciple Phil Schiller to affirm. Riffraff does not make it past the App Store's front desk, and Apple will not lend out jackets to any shady developers who show up flaunting the club's rules. And like any club, its success comes from the members sticking around.\n\nBut to the users and developers aggrieved by the company's practices (high club dues!) the walls are a means of exclusion. And even worse, that walled garden isn't just keeping people out — it's keeping people in.\n\nMuch of the conflict hinges on interpreting convenience or confinement, of attempting to prove loyalty or lock-in. Perhaps a drawn-out courtroom battle will spell out the spoils of Big Tech's conquest: that years later, people can't tell the difference.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Apple Stock Is About to Get Dangerously Close to Its 52-Week Low (and It Doesn't Even Have to Go Down)",
        "content": "Investors in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are not having a good 2024. The stock is down over 10% year to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up over 9%.\n\nIt's difficult for such a heavily weighted stock to underperform the broader benchmarks by that much in a short time. But Apple is dealing with several very real challenges and has largely missed out on the tech rally that is being fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAs of March 22, Apple is now just 10.5% away from its 52-week low during a time when many other tech stocks are setting new all-time highs. Here's why Apple is about to get even closer to its 52-week low even if the stock stays where it is, and whether you should buy it now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple stock is lapping lows\n\nApple's current 52-week low of $155.98 was reached on March 28, 2023. As the calendar rolls on, Apple's new 52-week low will get higher even if the stock price doesn't move. After May 4 (and assuming Apple doesn't go below this point), the new 52-week low will be $165.67 from Oct. 26, which is less than 5% below where Apple currently trades. By comparison, the stock's 52-week high of $199.62 occurred more recently, on Dec. 14, and it nearly exceeded that high just a couple of months ago in late January.\n\nA stock's 52-week lows and highs are merely ranges, but they do signal if investors are optimistic or pessimistic. Apple is already closer to its recent low than its high, but it will get much closer to the low with time.\n\nOn a favorable note, it's worth mentioning how steady Apple has been. There is only a 20% swing from its 52-week high and the late-October low, meaning it has not been a volatile stock. Its 4.1% sell-off on March 21 was the largest single-session drop since Aug. 4. You would be hard-pressed to find a big tech stock that hasn't fallen more than 5% in a session in over a year.\n\nApple is in a bit of a funk\n\nAs consistent as Apple has been, there are concerns that the investment thesis is weakening, setting the stage for further selling pressure. The company has a high success rate when it comes to hardware and accessories. But its current product pipeline is the most uncertain it has been in over a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company launched the iPad in January 2010. The Apple Watch, announced in September 2014, was initially met with skepticism but turned into a major hit. AirPods came out two years later in September 2016.\n\nAside from new versions of existing products, there hadn't been a significant new product until the Vision Pro was unveiled in June 2023 and made available in the U.S. on Feb. 2.\n\nThe company isn't in a new product and accessory drought, but the Vision Pro is unproven, and Apple simply hasn't come out with much else for a while now. Some of the uncertainty comes from within its existing ecosystem -- namely the iPhone.\n\nNew iPhone models feature improvements, but there hasn't been a massive leap for several years. Some hoped that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max would be a turning point, but that hasn't been the case thus far, as iPhone sales growth has ground to a halt.\n\nWhether it's a lack of innovation or the fact that the upgrade cycle is getting longer, the product and accessory portfolio looks particularly vulnerable right now. That all could change in a heartbeat if the Vison Pro becomes a resounding success, Apple launches an AI-enabled iPhone that is welcomed by users, or a lot of folks who bought new products during the height of the pandemic decide to upgrade.\n\nIn sum, it's still too early to sound the alarm on Apple's innovation glut, but there are cracks that are beginning to form.\n\nThe growth is gone (for now)\n\nTrailing diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up just 4.2% over the last two years. And judging by analyst estimates, the growth isn't going to return in the short term.\n\nIts price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 26.8, and its forward P/E is 26.3. Apple reported its 2024 first-quarter earnings for the period ended Dec. 30, 2023. Average analyst EPS estimates for the full fiscal year are $6.56.\n\nGrowth is expected to tick up in fiscal 2025, with average earnings estimates of $7.16 per share, 9% higher than fiscal 2024. But those results won't fully materialize until Apple reports its 2025 full-fiscal-year results in February 2026 -- a long time to wait.\n\nSingle-digit EPS growth is a negative outlook for Apple, especially because a few percentage points are due to buybacks. So, taking that out, forecasts are really only calling for net income growth in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2025, which would imply little improvement in product sales and next to no growth from the Vision Pro.\n\nAnd these forecasts don't even factor in the risks from the recently announced lawsuit against Apple by the Department of Justice. The suit targets the company's services more than its products and could compress margins for what has been a bright spot in an otherwise cloudy period.\n\nAn attractive setup\n\nWhen an excellent industry leader with an impeccable brand faces negative sentiment, a gloomy outlook, and other challenges, it is usually a good buying opportunity even if the stock goes down more in the short term. There are countless examples of this dynamic playing out across multiple industries.\n\nBig tech stocks got clobbered in 2022 and staged an epic recovery in 2023. This year, the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't Salesforce or Amazon or Microsoft -- it's Walt Disney, which had underperformed the market for multiple years but is up 28% in less than three months.\n\nWith challenges compounding, I expect Apple to break to a new 52-week low, especially once the margin narrows between its current price and the new higher one-year low after March 28. But the more Apple falls, the better value it will become for long-term investors.\n\nThe stock is worth buying now, but investors should closely monitor the performance of the Vision Pro and watch for updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference (usually early June) and its annual Apple Event (usually early to mid-September).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

It was a big laggard in Taiwan last year due to concerns that Apple’s China sales would slow due to sluggish demand for premium phones, but fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates fueled optimism over demand for the company’s AI servers. It’s now up 46% year-to-date.\n\nThe AI craze has meant big gains in companies like Nvidia Corp., as investors see the sector at a crucial point of growth. At Hon Hai, AI revenue may contribute half of server revenue this year if it succeeds in winning orders from key clients, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Albert Hung wrote in a research report. The figure was about 30% last year.\n\nTo be sure, Hon Hai’s total revenue exposure to AI is likely to remain at 10% to 12% this year, compared with about 20% for its competitors like Wiwynn Corp., Quanta Computer Inc. and Wistron Corp., according to JPMorgan. What’s more, its gains may be getting extended. Hon Hai is now among the most overbought stock on Taiwan’s benchmark index, in terms of 14-day relative strength, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.\n\nStill, analysts see the positive story for Hon Hai continuing.

        "title": "Apple’s first quarter has felt more like an entire (bad) year",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is in the midst of what you could generously call a “difficult” period. The company is contending with a high-profile antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, falling iPhone sales in China, and a regulatory investigation in the European Union. And those are just the headlines from the past week.\n\nThe company is also still facing a shortfall when it comes to generative AI capabilities. And while it’s widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI offering during its WWDC developer event on June 10, it’ll need to have quite an impressive showing if it’s going to catch up to its Big Tech rivals including Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nAll of that is hurting Apple’s stock price. Shares of the iPhone maker have fallen more than 7% since the start of the year and are up just 6.25% over the last 12 months. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, are up 14% year to date and 49% over the last 12 months. Google? Shares of the search giant are up 9% year to date and 43% in the last 12 months.\n\nSuffice it to say, Apple’s 2024 is not going well.\n\nApple’s China problem\n\nApple’s latest headache came Tuesday, when Bloomberg, citing Chinese government data, reported that iPhone shipments fell 33% year over year in the country in February.\n\nChina is Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the region accounted for $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in total revenue. That’s roughly 19% of the company’s sales.\n\nAnd this isn’t exactly out of the blue. Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research reported that iPhone sales fell 24% year over year through the first six weeks of 2024 in the country. Overall smartphone unit sales in China declined 7% during the same period. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a parallel session the China Development Forum at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, on Sunday, March 24, 2024. (Tatan Syuflana/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple has been aggressively expanding in China for years, but a resurgent Huawei and difficult economic conditions in the country are squeezing device sales. The company isn’t just sitting idly by, though. Last week, CEO Tim Cook flew to China for the opening of the company’s latest flagship store in Shanghai. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing and was expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Apple-authorized retailers are also trying to goose sales, cutting the price of the company’s latest iPhones in the hopes that it will get consumers to start buying again. However, it might take more than lower prices to make that happen.\n\nA battle with the DOJ\n\nOutside of Apple’s China sales drama, the company is also facing its long-anticipated antitrust fight with the Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which the DOJ filed last Thursday, accuses Apple of illegally maintaining dominance over the premium smartphone market by pushing aside competing apps and devices.\n\nThe Justice Department claims that Apple imposes restrictions on app developers, makes it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms, and hinders cloud gaming and so-called super apps that allow users to access multiple smaller apps from one larger platform. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference at Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, Thursday, March 21, 2024. (Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple, however, is fighting back, saying in a statement that the suit \"threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\n\nThe DOJ is seeking to force Apple to change its business practices, which could mean giving third-party apps greater access to the company’s platforms and requiring Apple to expand compatibility with third-party device makers.\n\nThe lawsuit could also prove to be a dangerous distraction for Apple similar to how Microsoft’s antitrust battle in the 90’s stole executives’ attention away from emerging technologies like smartphones. If Microsoft hadn’t been so invested in its antitrust fight at the time, there’s a good chance it would have seen the smartphone age coming as did Apple and Google, and launched its own line of handsets.\n\nEuropean Commission calling\n\nIn addition to slowing iPhone sales in China and the DOJ’s antitrust suit, the European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission on Monday, announced that it is looking into whether Apple is in compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act. European Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age, Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding the Digital Markets Act at EU headquarters in Brussels, Monday, March 25, 2024. (Virginia Mayo/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn a statement released Monday, the Commission said it is investigating Apple’s new app fee structure in the EU as well as whether it meets user choice obligations related to default apps and the ability to delete preinstalled apps.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act requires Apple to open up the iPhone to third-party app stores, enabling developers to get around the 30% and 15% fees the company charges for sales through its own App Store. While Apple said it will allow those third-party stores, the company said it will also charge developers a 50 euro cent Core Technology Fee per install per year on apps that have been installed more than 1 million times in the last 12 months.\n\nIn a statement, the EC said it is looking into whether Apple’s new fees defeat the purpose of the obligations of the Digital Markets Act.\n\nWhile Apple is certainly facing a slew of challenges, it’s far from down and out. It’s still the second-richest company in the world by market capitalization — behind Microsoft — and it’s sure to continue to sell millions of devices and services subscriptions throughout the year ahead.\n\nStill, for the foreseeable future, Apple could be in for a bumpy ride.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly lower during Tuesday’s session.\n\nMacRumors has reported that Apple is potentially introducing a “custom routes” feature in iOS 18. The discovery was made through a review of code associated with Apple Maps.\n\nThis feature will allow users to enter their chosen navigation paths, marking a significant expansion from the current pre-selected routes.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.57%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,060,688 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $212,138 or around 1,250 shares.\n\nRead This:  Top 3 Energy Stocks That May Keep You Up At Night In Q1\n\nTo calculate:  Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.96 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works:  The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple were up 1.5% to $172.38 at the time of publication Wednesday.\n\nRead More:  Jim Cramer Says Don't Sell This Beauty Brand, Believes KKR And Blackstone 'Can Make More Money'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock.com\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Why Apple Is Missing From Berkshire Hathaway's Permanent Holdings List",
        "content": "Earlier this month, I discussed some key takeaways from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s 2023 letter to shareholders. One of the main points covered was that the guru added Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and the five Japanese conglomerates to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) permanent holding list. However, he did not express his intention to indefinitely hold Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is currrently the conglomerate's largest holding.\n\nSince then, I have been pondering why the tech giant is not a permanent holding for Berkshire Hathaway. In this discussion, I will share my preliminary thoughts on the subject.\n\nBerkshire's permanent holdings are extremely rare\n\nFirst of all, if we look at Berkshire Hathaway's history, it is not hard to tell that while Buffett has bought many stocks, he only held a handful of them for more than 10 years. According to Markets Insider, his holding period for the 10 longest-held stocks range from 15 years to 35 years (I added 1 year to the holding period as the article was written in 2023). Of these 10 stocks, Buffett still held some such as BYD (SZSE:002594). However, there are only two stocks that he has explicitly said Berkshire will hold indefinitely, namely Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).\n\nBuffett's steadfast commitment to these two companies says a lot about his confidence in the resilience of their business models and growth prospects. This observation raises the question of the distinction between Berkshire's permanent holdings and non-permanent holdings. In order to answer this question, I revisited Buffett and Charlie Munger's four criteria and came up with a similar list for permanent holdings.\n\nBerkshire's permanent holding criteria\n\nWe all know Buffett and Munger's four criteria for making an investment decision:\n\nan understandable business favorable long-term economics able and trustworthy management a sensible price tag\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it's important to clarify that these four filters serve as guidelines for making initial purchase decisions, not for permanent holdings. Obviously, the criteria for permanent holdings are different.\n\nIn my view, the fundamental distinction between a permanent holding and a non-permanent holding is whether the business requires an able and trustworthy management to maintain its moat. In fact, both Munger and Buffett have often said that it is best to \"invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will.\" Compared to understandability and favorable long-term economics, idiot-proof is a much higher standard.\n\nAs for American Express and Coca-Cola, I am not sure whether the former qualifies as an \"idiot-proof\" business. In my view, the card company is quite complex, which make it more vulnerable to mismanagement. On the other hand, Coca-Cola, with its iconic brands and a widespread distribution network, seems to possess the characteristics of an idiot-proof business.\n\nAnother possible criterion for a permanent holding is a track record of dividend increases and share repurchases. Coca-Cola has raised its annual cash dividend for 62 consecutive years and its initial share repurchase program began in 1984.\n\nNow we can attempt to list Berkshire's criteria for permanent holdings:\n\nan understandable business favorable long-term economics idiot-proof a track record of dividend increases and share repurchases\n\nDoes Apple fit the permanent holding criteria?\n\nWith the above four criteria, we can evaluate whether Apple qualifies as a permanent holding.\n\nFirst, Apple's products are widely popular and have a loyal customer base. However, it still operates in the tech industry, which is notorious for the constant need for innovation. The dynamic nature of the industry makes it very hard to assess the long-term understandability and moat of the company's business as it must continuously adapt to evolving technologies and consumer preferences to maintain its competitive edge.\n\nSecond, Apple is most likely not idiot-proof. We can gain valuable insights into this aspect from the company's own history. When Steve Jobs was forced out in the 1980s, then-CEO John Sculley almost led to the company's demise. Apple was reborn after Jobs came back and reinvigorated the business. However, it is noteworthy that Berkshire Hathaway did not invest in the stock during his tenure as CEO. Buffett made the decision to purchase Apple shares years after Jobs' passing, following his observation of Tim Cook's exceptional operational capabilities and astute capital allocation decisions. This clearly indicates that Buffett does not consider Apple's business to be idiot-proof.\n\nIn terms of capital allocation, according to Apple's investor relation website, the company has been paying out a cash dividend since 1987 and has increased payments in most years. However, its share repurchase program is relatively new as the company only started to repurchase shares in 2012, after Cook's succession to the role of CEO. Interestingly, Buffett said that Jobs refused to buy back shares after consulting with him. This suggests his inability to effectively deploy capital was one of the key reasons why the guru did not invest in Apple during Jobs' tenure. At this point, it is unclear whether Apple can sustain its smart capital allocation strategy after Cook's eventual retirement.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rapid pace of technological advancement and the potential change in capital allocation decisions after Cook's tenure are two major potential hurdles for Apple to remain in Berkshire's portfolio for the very long term. Therefore, while Apple possesses many of the characteristics of a very high-quality business, it is still an unlikely candidate for Berkshire's permanent holdings list.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best momentum ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nWhat is Momentum Investing?\n\nMomentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future.\n\nMomentum Gaining Momentum\n\nThe renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s“Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joinedCNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’.\n\nHowever, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on 'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing. Although, the rebalance at the end of Q1 2024 could pose a risk to momentum followers.\n\nSome of the top momentum stocks to buy include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, we discuss the best momentum ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best momentum ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\nA view of the hustle and bustle of trading activity on a busy trading floor.\n\nBest Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\n10. Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 74.06%\n\nInvesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) is based on the Dorsey Wright Technical Leaders Index, comprising about 100 US companies from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. It utilizes a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC to select firms showing strong relative strength characteristics. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) expense ratio came in at 0.62%. The fund was launched on March 1, 2007. It ranks 10th on our list of the best momentum ETFs.\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the top holdings of Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP). It is a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. On February 7, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $9.26, beating market estimates by $0.05, and a revenue of $3.83 billion, missing Street consensus by $30 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the best momentum stocks to invest in.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) was also a bottom contributor to portfolio performance. The Company reported +11% sales growth for the quarter, driven by a +17% increase in sales to professional service providers, leading to +12% growth in operating income and +17% increase in earnings per share. The Company – true to its long capital allocation culture – has aggressively bought back shares over the past 12 months. O’Reilly Automotive’s professional sales segment continues to dramatically outpace its publicly traded competitors. The Company has a mostly singular focus on the United States, whereas several of its competitors have diverted their attention away from the large and fragmented U.S. professional market, toward non-U.S. or non-automotive markets. In the short-term, investors are focused on the mild weather that has unfolded during the late fall and early winter of 2023. Mild weather often leads to temporary slowdowns in sales growth for auto parts, but we would look to take advantage of that because O’Reilly’s long-term competitive positioning and extraordinary returns on capital are well-entrenched.”\n\n9. Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 76.65%\n\nInvesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS) tracks the Dorsey Wright SmallCap Technical Leaders Index, which selects approximately 200 companies based on their market performance and relative strength characteristics according to a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC.

But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\n7.

The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n6. Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 90.11%\n\nVanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) employs a rules-based quantitative model to assess US common stocks, focusing on those with robust recent performance.

(NASDAQ:META) is the largest holding of Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO). On March 18, Mizuho Securities added Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as a top pick, maintaining a Buy rating and a $575 price target on the shares.

(NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 funds in the last quarter.\n\nSequoia Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Two additional trims, in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Carmax, were more substantive in nature. When Meta’s stock declined in 2022, we judged it to be significantly mispriced and held our ground through the bottom. We trimmed the position serially last year as the stock soared because we were wary of holding a large position exposed to significant regulatory risks, particularly in Europe. We are comfortable owning Meta at today’s much-reduced weighting and current valuation. The smaller position size reflects our updated assessment of the balance of long-term risk versus reward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 States That Produce the Most Renewable Energy in the US 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2024 14 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle",
        "content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): \"The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.\"\n\nBut not all legal experts agree federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone.\n\n\"My guess is [Apple] will win,\" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEven if Apple does not prevail in New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Yes I think that Apple will prevail in the end.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland, announcing the government's antitrust suit against Apple. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) — alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\n\nThe case against Apple is the widest ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\n\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government’s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products — including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps — on the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook In China last Sunday. (Wu Hao/Pool Photo via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone’s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneiner said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument \"I think they win.\"\n\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company’s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\n\"Apple does have more security, because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneiner said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\n\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneiner.\n\n\"Don’t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\n\nThe hurdles DOJ must overcome\n\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\n\"I think it’s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple’s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\n\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olsen.\n\nTo overcome those limits, Olsen said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law. Apple has a dominant share of the US smartphone market. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/file photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olsen explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\n\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\n\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\n\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that’s problematic?” Picker said.\n\nThe government’s answer is that Apple’s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products – like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\n\nA 'pretty hard case'\n\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than to harm them.\n\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega popular gaming app “Fortnite,” Epic Games. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. (Photo by Philip Pacheco/Getty Images) (Philip Pacheco via Getty Images)\n\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\n\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\n\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olsen said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olsen said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Apple (AAPL) reached $169.71, with a -0.67% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.28%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.08%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.42%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 5.69% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.67%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.50, indicating a 1.32% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $90.38 billion, indicating a 4.7% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $6.55 per share and revenue of $385.52 billion, indicating changes of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% higher. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 26.09. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.02, which means Apple is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.06. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.51.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, putting it in the bottom 14% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The AI Underdogs: 3 Stocks That Should Be Getting More Love",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence, the usual suspects for AI stocks comes up. Clearly, going with these winners has not been a bad idea. However, investors that are just tuning into this opportunity may want to consider lesser-appreciated ideas.\n\nA primary concern is that the top-tier AI stocks feature rich multiples, whether against sales, earnings or some other metric. To be fair, with such a vast opportunity, it’s difficult to determine valuation. What seems like an overvalued play could indeed be a discounted prospect.\n\nNevertheless, there are quite a few compelling enterprises that just aren’t getting the spotlight. The argument here is that they should. So, without further delay, below are intriguing ideas for AI stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWith discussions about digital intelligence, IBM (NYSE:IBM) tends to be an afterthought. That’s not meant to be a pejorative against the company known as Big Blue. It’s just that the legacy tech firm has been slow to adapt to various changes in the tech ecosystem, such as cloud computing. However, with IBM’s aggressive (if not audacious) plan to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI, it’s one of the top names to consider.\n\nOther companies talk a good game when it comes to generative AI. However, if Big Blue is successful in replacing human workers with machines, it would achieve an unprecedented level of productivity acceleration. Obviously, humans have this pesky tendency of demanding things like salaries and civil rights. With machines, you don’t deal with any of these “unproductive” issues.\n\nIt’s also hard to dismiss the results so far. Last fiscal year, the company beat bottom-line targets four times out of four. The average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.58%. For the current fiscal year, analysts see revenue of $58.69 billion. That would be up 3.1% from last year’s print of $56.94 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombined with IBM’s forward yield of 3.48%, it’s one of the underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you hear the name Walmart (NYSE:WMT), you immediately think about retail and discounts. Chances are, you’re not really looking at WMT stock as an AI play. However, the company’s leadership team would like to shift this paradigm. Per its website, the big-box retailer is leveraging generative AI to give time back to households for more important endeavors.\n\nUnder a typical search protocol, a customer may go to a retailer’s e-commerce platform and look for items to buy. However, knowing what you want requires some planning. And planning takes time. That can accrue to wasted hours during the week that can be spent on more important matters. Therefore, Walmart has integrated a large language model to provide smart recommendations to their customers.\n\nStated differently, Walmart aims to take away the pain point of the planning process and just get right down to product recommendations. That’s a win for the customer and a win for Walmart. Moving forward, analysts see the company hitting just under $620 billion in sales for fiscal 2025. That should be more than doable.\n\nPlus, you’re looking at a solid retail business that pays dividends. Therefore, WMT ranks among the hidden-gem AI stocks.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nFor tech-centric AI stocks, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is notable because it really hasn’t received much love at all. While other tech firms have seen nothing but green ink over the past 52 weeks, BIDU stock is deep in the red. For full disclosure, lingering questions about the viability of China’s economy has sidelined Baidu and other Chinese tech firms. Still, BIDU makes for a tempting source of speculation.\n\nHowever, the underperformance might not last indefinitely. Last week, consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) held preliminary talks with Baidu about using the Chinese firm’s generative AI technology in its devices in China. Unique regulations within the world’s second-largest economy has somewhat forced Apple to consider a local AI partner. Cynically, that’s great news for Baidu shareholders.\n\nBased on past financial performances, it almost seems a matter of time before BIDU stock really soars. In the past four quarters, Baidu’s positive earnings surprise came out to just under 27%. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe that revenue will reach $20.08 billion. If so, that would be up 7.8% against last year’s print of $18.62 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Though Apple didn’t say what it plans to unveil — in usual fashion — people familiar with the matter have said that the presentation will focus heavily on AI.\n\nContinuing an approach used since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the conference will be hosted for free on Apple’s website and app for developers. The opening day announcements will take place in-person at the company’s campus in Cupertino, California.\n\nApple is expected to unveil its next major software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro headset and smartwatch — and its new AI strategy will be front and center for the planned iOS 18 upgrade.\n\nIn announcing the event, Apple marketing executive Greg Joswiak said, “It’s going to be Absolutely Incredible” — a clear nod to AI.\n\nApple’s artificial intelligence strategy will include a slew of new proactive features to assist users in their daily lives. The company isn’t planning to debut its own generative AI chatbot, though. Instead, Apple is holding talks with potential partners like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI to supply generative AI services, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nThe iOS 18 update is expected to be the most ambitious overhaul of the iPhone’s software in its history, according to people working on the upgrade. The company is also planning a minor refresh of the Apple Watch’s software and the first major update to the operating system running on the Vision Pro headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn’t Classified Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Jokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Some developers and students will be invited in-person at Apple Park on the opening day, it added.\n\nInvestors are closely watching for updates on artificial intelligence development at Apple, which has so far spoken little about incorporating the technology into its devices. The company earlier this year lost the crown as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft.\n\nApple plans to use AI technology such as Google's Gemini for a chatbot within Apple's operating systems, while the iPhone maker's own AI engine will handle more behind-the-scenes tasks throughout the new software, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.\n\nThe company also plans to make the iPhone home screen more customizable in iOS 18, which some reports have said could mark the biggest update to the iPhone operating system in years.\n\nThe developers conference comes at a time when sales of Apple's iPhone remain weak, while those of Macs and iPads have fallen amid a worldwide slump in gadget sales.\n\nAt last year's conference, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, a new core processor, and new computers.

        "title": "Adobe's Moat Is in Creative Solutions, but Its Enterprise Offerings Are Under Threat",
        "content": "Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an older but highly valuable investment in digital software suites, including a specific moat in advanced digital creative design studios, where I believe it is unmatched by any peers. However, it faces threats in its digital experience offerings related to broader enterprise solutions. While I consider the stock to be undervalued at this time, the premium over its wider industry adds somewhat more risk to the investment.\n\nOverview and updates\n\nAdobe is one of the most prominent companies in the technology industry, with a main role in digital content creation. Here is a brief breakdown of its core areas of expertise:\n\nDigital Media: Operations from its Creative Cloud, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro. Digital Experience: Offers an integrated platform for analytics, commerce, marketing and customer engagement. Publishing and Advertising: E-learning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing and other solutions.\n\nFor fiscal fourth-quarter 2023, the company reported record revenue of $5.05 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12%. It has set its target total revenue in the range of $5.10 billion to $5.15 billion for the first quarter of 2024, highlighting expectations for significant growth in its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.\n\nNotably, its Digital Media segment is supported by artificial intelligence through integrations into its software products. In particular, it introduced Firefly, a generative AI platform developed to empower creative, development and marketing workflows. During the Adobe MAX 2023 event, the company unveiled three new AI models:\n\nFirefly Image 2 Model: Generates high-quality images, improving rendering and creative control. Adobe Firefly Vector Model: Creates vector graphics through text prompts, simplifying the design process for creating logos and icons. Adobe Firefly Design Model: Enables the instant generation of design templates from text descriptions, streamlining marketing and design operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nI believe each of these advances is a critical step in the right direction for Adobe, but I also think the company still has some way to go in terms of mastering the art of prompt-generated creativity. As is the same in the writing industry, it is next to impossible in visual arts to get high-caliber results from artificial intelligence. Arguably, this is something that will be developed in time, but Adobe will have a significant role in how it balances the art of artificial assistance in visual creativity with high levels of involvement from creative directors, balancing between efficiency and human creative vision. It is awfully easy to sacrifice the vision part for efficiency, and I believe Adobe has to be careful not to cheapen its brand at this time by focusing too intently on quick results from its programs rather than adding depth to creative capabilities.\n\nMarket and competition\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about Adobe is that it is unique in its operational scope. Few, if any, companies of its size command the areas of operation it specifically caters to. Arguably, no other company on the planet offers a comprehensive creative suite quite like Adobe, as it focuses on the elite visual creator. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have capabilities similar to Adobe's offerings, but it offers a more concentrated tool base for the top-end professional. Apple and Microsoft's offerings are widely scattered and not focused enough on this demographic to have any real, lasting competitive value in the area.\n\nThere are also smaller competitors, like Canva and Affinity by Serif. While Canva is evidently catered toward novice designers, Affinity directly competes with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, but distinctly at a one-time purchase price. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to Adobe Illustrator in particular, and it has positive reviews, but users have also noted some limitations, including performance dips on Windows.\n\nNonetheless, I assess Adobe to be a one-of-a-kind and high-operational value technology company with minimal direct competitors, allowing it to command a strong moat in its specific niche of advanced visual design. Adobe Experience Cloud, on the other hand, faces more distinct competitors, including from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). I believe its digital experience offerings are much more prone to competitive risks than its creative suite, given such an aggressive advance from multiple companies in the space at this time.\n\nFinancials\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, I have chosen to compare Adobe to Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. While I understand the overlap is not ideal, I believe it offers a valid peer comparison for the analysis of opportunity cost. Each of these is of similar market cap, and I believe they are all highly compelling investments, to varying degrees, at a time of heightened adoption of AI.\n\nFirst of all, let's take a snapshot of the core financial statistics of each of these peers:\n\nAdobe: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.56, net margin of 27.97%, three-year revenue growth rate of 16.8% and forward price-earnings ratio of 28.66. Salesforce: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.6, net margin of 11.87%, three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7% and forward price-earnings ratio of 30.88. SAP: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63, net margin of 20.68%, three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% and forward price-earnings ratio of 37.30. ServiceNow: Equity-to-asset ratio of 0.44, net margin of 19.30%, three-year revenue growth rate of 25% and forward price-earnings ratio of 57.08.\n\nAdobe is evidently in a very strong position with an immensely high growth rate, considering how long it has been around in comparison to the other companies in my peer analysis. ServiceNow particularly shines for being high growth, but this is to be expected; the company is fairly new, with its initial public offering in 2012. Adobe, on the other hand, had its IPO in 1986. Yet, I consider all of these companies to have remarkably strong financial profiles in general. Where Adobe particularly stands out is in the relative stability of the balance sheet alongside competitive growth that is expected to continue at an earnings per share without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of 14% over the next three reports, based on consensus analyst estimates.\n\nThe company has a significant tendency to perform share buybacks, buying its own stock at varying and often very high amounts, like in 2022 when it bought back $6.55 billion worth. I believe this is an excellent investment from the company to bolster long-term equity value for shareholders, and thankfully its balance sheet, not too overburdened by debt, warrants this kind of action without it negatively impacting its overall financial health too significantly.\n\nValuation\n\nOver the past 10 years, Adobe has had a median price-earnings ratio of 53.14. At this time, its price-earnings ratio is 43.49, which indicates a discount from the valuation typical for the stock of 18.16%.\n\nWe can also compare Adobe to its competitors to gauge what is normal for the group. The average forward price-earnings ratio of Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow is 32.28. Adobe has a forward price-earnings ratio at this time of 28.66, which is 11.21% lower than its peers on average.\n\nMy current estimate is a median of these two figures, an estimated margin of safety in the present stock price of around 15%. Investors should understand my value analysis and associated safety margin do not include an analysis of intrinsic value, and the reason I have left this out is because of the high premium investors are willing to pay for the stock, which unfortunately seems to nullify a discounted cash flow analysis at the time of writing.\n\nMy value analysis and associated conclusion of Adobe's undervaluation, therefore, come with more risk for downside volatility as a result of significant shifts in investor sentiment that may occur. However, it should be noted that shifts in purchase sentiment can also be as random as shifts in investor sentiment, meaning my valuation method has considerable weight against a DCF analysis.\n\nRisks\n\nOther than the associated risk with my valuation method, Adobe faces a few critical company-specific risks, including rapid changes in the generative AI and co-pilot technology landscape, which has the potential over time to make an investment quite obsolete if it does not successfully hire experts in new fields of advanced capabilities. Other peers who have the potential to take market share through potential expansion strategies, particularly as it relates to digital experience, include CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), all serious threats in terms of intelligent data analysis and security-of-software processes. Many of these new platforms offer a one-point solution for all enterprise software needs, significantly challenging some of Adobe's offerings.\n\nAdditionally, there are threats to Adobe's creative tools, including from OpenAI and its suite of image creation tools, but also its new Sora technology, which has the ability to smart-render video from text prompts. I believe Adobe is significantly behind OpenAI. And with the backing of Microsoft, I highly doubt that Adobe will be able to remain at the cutting edge of advanced AI generation like OpenAI will. Still, Adobe will likely remain a vital tool for creative professionals if it can continue to corner the market of advanced, highly professional digital imaging with a full breadth of capabilities. This is something OpenAI does not even scratch the surface of at present.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdobe is a unique company that is positioned particularly well in digital creative design studios, where its moat commands lasting shareholder value. Yet the threats to its other enterprise solutions offerings are significant and I think the company would be wise to focus on its core moat in creative solutions, as I see a considerable likelihood that it will be outcompeted in terms of its broader analytics and customer relationship management efforts. While this may cause some slower growth for Adobe long term, the overall operations look positioned to continue succeeding, at least for now. At this time, I rate the stock a buy with a caveat to watch carefully where it places its strategic focus moving forward.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

Apple accounts for the vast majority of those shipments, as the only overseas player with a meaningful market share. The February decline marks a second consecutive month of lower shipments. In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units, or about 39% fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures.\n\nThe shares dropped less than 1% in New York on Tuesday morning.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best affordable tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTech Sector Growth in 2024\n\nOn January 29, Fidelity Investments issued its outlook for the technology sector for 2024 and beyond. According to Fidelity, tech's performance in 2024 will depend on the macro environment to a certain extent. The outlook report noted that in 2023, tech finished the race as the top performer among all market sectors, a position it continued to occupy till late January of 2024, when it still outperformed the S&P 500. The biggest contributor to this has been coming from artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite this, some financial professionals find it difficult to hop on the tech stock wagon, believing that most tech stocks are overpriced. For instance, on February 6, Bloomberg reported that Amundi SA, Europe's biggest fund manager, believes that the optimism in tech stocks is misplaced, resulting in the fund manager refraining from joining the \"big tech stocks frenzy.\" Additionally, analysts at Bank of America Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been drawing parallels between the price levels of tech stocks today and the dot-com era bubble. As is the case with any bubble, it may be the case that this AI bubble, too, will soon burst.\n\nWhile this skepticism is also rising, many investors are still attracted to tech. On January 29, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, appeared on Bloomberg Radio to discuss this. His reasoning for tech stocks remaining an attractive investment is based on the following factors:\n\n\"They have annuity-like businesses, they have pricing power, and they have global brands... the market views them as the stocks they go to. It's the all-weather stock.\"\n\nThus, the debate on whether investors should rush to buy tech stocks or avoid them for the moment continues. For those looking to buy into tech, there are some key areas they should look out for.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop Areas in Tech: AI, Semiconductors, and Cloud Computing\n\nAccording to Fidelity, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and cloud computing are the main areas to look at in the tech sector for investors today. Semiconductor companies have been investing in AI with increasing fervor since the launch of ChatGPT and, in some cases, even before then. The rise of AI has actually propelled semiconductor companies to greater heights since the use of their chips in AI applications has become practically essential. In the case of cloud computing, dedicated tech investors will know that this area of tech has been around and been popular for a long time. With companies and enterprises swiftly moving their data and workloads to the cloud, companies offering cloud-based software are gaining and retaining investor attention and money.\n\nAll in all, tech may be a sector with a bright future. According to Deloitte's 2024 Technology Industry Outlook, global IT investments in 2024 are expected to see double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services. Additionally, analyst estimates show that public cloud spending will grow by over 20% this year, with AI investments also significantly contributing to increased overall spending growth for tech. Deloitte's outlook noted that by 2025, AI-related investments may reach $200 billion globally, with the US leading in this area.\n\nConsidering the above, big-tech companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are considered to be the best investment picks this year. However, these companies are far from affordable for many investors, including many new investors. This is especially the case considering the skepticism concerning the perceived overvaluation of tech stocks in the market today. Hence, cheaper tech stocks with immense potential in today's market may be an excellent place to start your tech investment. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best affordable tech stocks to buy now. Our list includes some of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the tech stocks to buy that are too cheap to ignore. 13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best affordable tech stocks to buy, we used a stock screener to identify tech stocks with share prices below $50 and P/E ratios under 25. We then shortlisted our 13 best affordable tech stocks by looking at their upside potentials and selected the stocks with the highest upside potentials. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of March 24. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\n13. Vishay Precision Group, Inc.

        "title": "Best Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas of Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street delivered an upbeat performance last week due to dovish Fed cues. The S&P 500 added 2.3%, the Dow Jones advanced 2% and the Nasdaq rose about 2.9%.  There was growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates as the U.S. central bank sticked to its previous projections of three rate cuts despite recently-released hot inflation data.\n\nInside Fed Meeting\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged and projected three rate cuts this year. During the news conference, Chair Powell acknowledged that inflation had been more persistent than expected over the past two months but expressed hope that inflation was on a sustainable path back to 2%.\n\nThe central bank expects solid economic growth and the unemployment rate to remain at a low level. Powell noted that a strong job market wouldn’t deter the central bank from reducing rates. Stocks soared after the press conference.\n\nBroadening of Wall Street Rally\n\nWhile technology stocks – being high-growth in nature – continue to perform well, the rally has broadened, with a clear resurgence in mid- and small-cap stocks recently. The financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven - Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year, per a Reuters article.\n\nBoJ Ends Negative Rate Era\n\nBoJ (Bank of Japan) hiked its short-term interest rates to around 0% to 0.1% from -0.1%, according to its statement at the end of its two-day March policy meeting. It marked the first rate-hike in 17 years, putting an end to the world’s only negative rates regime on signs of robust wage gains this year. Japan’s negative rates regime had been in place since 2016 (read: BoJ Ends Negative Rate Era: ETFs to Win).\n\nStory continues\n\nWoes in Apple\n\nApple shares fell 2% last week as the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging the iPhone giant used its power over app distribution to block innovations, resulting in higher prices for consumers.\n\nEarlier this week, Google shares surged on reports that the company was in talks with Apple to bring its Generative AI engine, Gemini, to iPhones. Apple was also reportedly in negotiations with ChatGPT parent OpenAI. Alphabet shares gained 1.4% last week.\n\nInvestors have expressed concerns that Apple has fallen behind in the AI race. CEO Tim Cook announced that the iPhone maker would introduce new generative AI capabilities later this year.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mania Losing Steam?\n\nWhile the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract billions in inflows, Grayscale's GBTC has recorded outflows of more than $12 billion since it was converted into an ETF, mainly due to its high fees. Grayscale is now planning a \"mini-me\" version of GBTC, which will come with a lower expense ratio.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin has logged a meaningful pullback last week, falling more than 10% from its all-time high, as interest in fledgling spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) moderates. JPMorgan Chase and Co. strategists caution that the retreat may not be over yet, per Bloomberg (read: Is Bitcoin Euphoria Waning? ETFs to Gain).\n\nWinning Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETF areas of last week.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF MSOX – Up 16.7%\n\nIn a White House meeting, Vice President Kamala Harris last week urged the DEA to expedite the rescheduling of marijuana, criticizing its current Schedule 1 classification as \"absurd\" and \"patently unfair.\" She put stress on the need for swift action and highlighted ongoing efforts toward rescheduling (read: Is Rescheduling a Certainty for Cannabis? ETFs That Surge).\n\nHomebuilding\n\nDirexion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares NAIL – Up 16.1%\n\nThe homebuilding sector of the broad stock market has been an area to watch lately, given the likely decline in mortgage rates. The Fed also indicated about the possibility of 75 bps of rate cut in 2024, propelling the demand for rate-sensitive homebuilding sector. Moreover, despite higher rates and home prices, existing home sales surged in February.\n\nBull Nvidia\n\nGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL – Up 14.5%\n\nOne highly anticipated event of the week was Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC). CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the latest cutting-edge chips during the event, which was held in person for the first time since 2019. This has boosted the stock price. Nvidia stock was up 4.3% last week.\n\nBull Travel\n\nMicroSectors Travel 3x Leveraged ETN FLYU – Up 13.8%\n\nAirlines stocks that make up a considerable portion of the underlying index soared last week. Some of the buying activity probably was influenced by a fresh note from UBS analysts, who started positive coverage on the airline sector, per barrons.com.They see the industry’s steep cost pressures will ease later this year and margins may move higher.\n\nBanks\n\nMicroSectors U.S. Big Banks Index 3X Leveraged ETNs BNKU – Up 13.2%\n\nThe banking sector surged on dovish Fed cues. If the economic growth gains momentum, helping long-term rates to go higher and the Fed cuts short-term rates, the yield curve would steepen. This, in turn, would benefit bank stocks materially.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paid CEOs in the US and their college degrees. We have also discussed the relevance of college degrees with CEOs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees.\n\nIn a dataset of 2,600 CEOs, 8% lacked a college degree, a surprising finding given the rising demand for academic qualifications in the job market. Currently, one-third of positions that previously mandated only a high-school diploma now require a four-year college degree, with one in four roles that once sought a bachelor’s degree now demanding a master’s. Concurrently, 75% of Americans perceive higher education as financially unattainable.\n\nCEOs without degrees get to leadership roles through different avenues. Firstly, many arose from within their respective industries or companies, possessing specialized knowledge and extensive experience in their niche domains. Secondly, they demonstrate exceptional performance, particularly prevalent in sectors like sales where achievements are quantifiable and conspicuous. Lastly, they excel in assembling talented teams, relying on their insights and expertise to drive success.\n\nThe relationship between undergraduate degrees and CEO success varies across industries. While tech sectors often require specialized education, other industries show a broader range of educational backgrounds among CEOs. The significance of pursuing a BA, BS, or BBA in attaining CEO positions remains unclear beyond industry-specific norms.\n\nIn analyzing the educational backgrounds of Fortune 100 CEOs, it's evident that undergraduate degrees play an important role in shaping career trajectories. The most common degrees among CEOs are Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), with 53% holding one of these degrees, while 47% have Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. Notably, 45% of those with BS degrees pursued business-related fields rather than traditional science or engineering disciplines.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that among the 2023 Fortune 100 CEOs, merely 11.8% obtained undergraduate degrees from Ivy League schools, with even fewer holding Ivy League MBAs. The success stories of CEOs like Doug McMillon of Walmart, who graduated from the University of Arkansas, confirm the value of performance over prestige in the corporate world. Furthermore, the prevalence of CEOs from public universities, such as Tim Cook of Apple Inc (NASDSAQ:AAPL) and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, highlights the accessibility of success beyond Ivy League corridors.\n\nNevertheless, tech industry CEOs predominantly hold undergraduate degrees directly related to engineering. Examples include Tim Cook's degree in industrial engineering and Larry Page's in computer engineering. However, exceptions exist, such as CEOs like Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, who hold degrees in history despite leading financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), let’s look at their latest financial performance.\n\nIn the annual report for the year 2023, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) demonstrated strong financial performance across its business segments. The firm's Global Banking & Markets segment retained its leadership, achieving milestones such as maintaining the top rank in advisory net revenues for the 21st consecutive year and securing prominent positions in equity and debt underwriting. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) excelled in Equities and FICC, achieving its second-highest net revenue year since 2010. This performance translated into tangible growth, with financing revenues across FICC and Equities witnessing a 15% compounded annual growth rate since 2019, reaching nearly $8 billion in 2023.\n\nFor investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) showcased impressive returns over the past five years. Book value per share increased by approximately 50 percent, outperforming peers, while the stock price increased by around 130 percent, compared to an average of approximately 60 percent among peers. Furthermore, the quarterly dividend more than tripled during this period.  Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024 and beyond, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) remains focused on key priorities outlined by its leadership, including serving clients with excellence, being an employer of choice, and delivering strong shareholder returns.\n\nOn the other hand, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) faced a downturn in profits, primarily due to $3.7 billion in one-time charges and a decline in interest income as it invested more to retain customer deposits. Despite this setback, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives remain optimistic about the US economic landscape, highlighting consumer resilience.\n\nThe financial performance of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) garnered mixed reactions from analysts. While the bank managed to exceed estimates by reporting a profit of 70 cents per share, excluding one-off charges, some analysts noted its underperformance compared to peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Despite challenges in this domain, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) exhibited strength in other areas, such as trading and investment banking.\n\nLooking ahead, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) anticipates modest growth in loans, expecting a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in 2024. However, the bank foresees continued challenges in net interest income, projecting a decline in the first and second quarters before a potential recovery in the latter half of the year. 20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees\n\nA successful CEO in a modern office with a sweeping view of the financial district.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the highest paid CEOs in the US, we relied on data compiled by the AFL-CIO Executive paywatch about annual compensation of CEOs in the US. We then looked at the individual profiles of these CEO’s through their business websites or official linkedin to identify their college degrees. Please note that we excluded two names from our list i.e, Austin Russell and Tomer Weingarten. Austin Russell was a college drop out and Tomer Weingarten didn’t attend college after high school.\n\nPlease note that Elon Musk was not in the original list by AFL-CIO, probably because Musk doesn't have a traditional salary and his salary is often tied with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s financial performance. However, we have added Musk to the list, given his consistently high compensation packages which have also sparked debates recently.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20. David Epstein\n\nCollege Degree: Pharmacy\n\nDavid assumed the role of CEO at Seagen in 2022, capitalizing on his 30+ years of global expertise in drug development and leadership. Under his guidance, Seagen's cancer drug portfolio flourished, emphasizing R&D and global expansion. Previously, David held executive roles at Flagship Pioneering and Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS).\n\n19. Hock Tan\n\nCollege Degree: Mechanical Engineering\n\nTan Hock is a Malaysian-American CEO of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). He graduated from MIT in 1975 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and later earned a master's degree in the same field. He also pursued an MBA at Harvard University. Tan's career has justified a perfect blend of engineering expertise and business acumen.\n\n18. Thomas Shanon\n\nCollege Degree: International Relations\n\nThomas F. Shannon, founder of Bowlero Corp (NYSE:BOWL) is a seasoned business leader with a distinguished career. Currently serving as Chairman & CEO of Bowlero Corp. and its New York division, he also holds key positions in subsidiary companies including AMF Bowling Worldwide, Inc., AMF Bowling Centers, Inc., and Strike Holdings LLC. With an extensive background in the industry, Shannon has driven significant growth and innovation.

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 2 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The stock market is an excellent vehicle for generating wealth over many years. It isn't the only way to build up a large retirement nest egg, of course, but owning a diversified portfolio of stocks puts you in a great position to benefit from the long-term growth of the global economy.\n\nBesides having a long holding period, the other main ingredient necessary to produce great returns is owning the right stocks. You'll do well simply matching the wider market's roughly 15% annual appreciation. But extending that figure by even a percentage point or two can make a huge difference over several decades.\n\nWith that goal in mind, let's look at a few stocks that seem destined to be a positive force in your retirement portfolio.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) business has been going through a rough patch lately, with sales declining to $383 billion from $394 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Consumers were less excited to purchase iPhone and Mac products in 2023 as demand for tech devices slowed overall following big gains in the prior two years.\n\nApple is still an incredibly strong business. The company's $383 billion of revenue last year compares well to the $366 billion posted two years earlier. Success in its rapidly expanding services segment offset most of the weakness in the iPhone and Mac franchises in 2023, and that should help to stabilize growth going forward. Growth has returned at the start of fiscal 2025, although it will take some time before it speeds back up toward the double digits.\n\nMeanwhile, you'll struggle to find a more financially impressive company. Apple regularly generates more than $100 billion in annual operating cash flow. Those resources allow management to spend aggressively on repurchasing the stock, which in turn amplifies per-share earnings growth. Investors should benefit from that virtuous cycle, even through those inevitable periods of sluggish sales trends.\n\n2. Walmart\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) has created many millionaires over the decades that it worked to build its dominant retailing business. That process might not be over just yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, the chain already has a massive global sales base, and a high valuation to go along with it. Walmart won't quickly double or triple its current $500 billion market capitalization.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you can't get great returns from holding this retailer over the next several decades. Sales growth was robust in 2023 and was anchored by rising customer traffic. That success reflects Walmart's ability to deliver value to its core shoppers, who are increasingly looking for deals. Few of its peers can match Walmart's low prices, which flow from its massive economies of scale.\n\nShareholders today have a good chance at capitalizing on Walmart's push to become more than just a brick-and-mortar retailer. E-commerce sales last year crossed $100 billion and jumped more than 20% compared to the prior year. Walmart is getting a lift from its growing digital advertising business as well.\n\nThese wins are lifting the company's profit margin above the 3% to 4% rate that investors have seen for many years. Even a small uptick here would have a huge impact on Walmart's annual earnings potential -- if the retailer can make it a sustainable one.\n\nWhile they wait for progress on this score, shareholders can collect Walmart's dividend and allow those quarterly payments to automatically reinvest into more shares. That way, you'll amplify your long-term returns and speed up the process of building wealth with your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 25, 2024\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos has positions in Apple.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Are Considerably Cheaper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend has changed the corporate landscape more than the advent of the internet. However, the arrival of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may give history a run for its money.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be delegated to humans. The incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to \"learn\" over time and become more proficient at their tasks, is what ultimately gives AI utility in practically every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock has soared thanks to the AI revolution\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the span of a little over one year, it's become the foundational-infrastructure play in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for a greater-than 90% share of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia is still in the process of ramping its production. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should help ease supply chain issues for Nvidia and allow the company to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they usually are.\n\nIn addition to contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own to either complement or replace Nvidia's data-center infrastructure. Even if Nvidia is able to maintain some degree of advantage(s) over these in-house GPUs from its top customers, future orders from these four businesses are liable to taper.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia finds itself at risk of cannibalizing its own gross margin as it expands production. The reason data-center sales more than tripled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) is because of GPU scarcity. Demand was so strong for its A100 and H100 chips that the company was able to dramatically increase the price of these units. As Nvidia's GPU production, and that of its competition, increases, industrywide GPU scarcity and Nvidia's pricing power should wane.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the most damning factor of all might be Nvidia's valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget Nvidia: These two \"Magnificent Seven\" components are considerably cheaper\n\nThere are a number of ways to \"value\" stocks. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works well for mature businesses, it doesn't do a particularly good job of valuing the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's largest and most influential businesses (listed in order of descending market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia  Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven businesses offer well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in their respective industries. They're also well known for reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. That's why cash flow tends to be the best measure of value when analyzing Nvidia and its peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs of the closing bell on March 22, Nvidia was valued at just north of 30 times Wall Street's forward-year cash-flow estimates. That makes Nvidia the priciest stock within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe good news for investors is that two other Magnificent Seven components with artificial intelligence ties are historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus cash-flow forecasts, Alphabet is expected to generate more than $11 in cash flow per share in 2025. Based on its closing price for March 22, this places Alphabet at roughly 13.5 times forward-year cash flow. Not only is this less than half the multiple Nvidia trades at, but it represents a roughly 24% discount to Alphabet's price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe operating segment that makes Alphabet tick is Google. In February, Google registered a 91.6% share of worldwide internet search, according to GlobalStats. It's sustained at least a 90% monthly share of global search dating back nine years. Being the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s), it suggests Google should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut it's Alphabet's cloud-infrastructure service platform, Google Cloud, which offers the most promise in terms of cash-flow growth. Google Cloud accounted for a 10% share of global cloud-infrastructure service spend during the September-ended quarter, and this segment delivered its first year of profits in 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also where Alphabet has many of its artificial intelligence tie-ins. It's allowing customers to use generative AI solutions to build applications within the cloud that can improve customer interactions and/or help businesses better target consumers with their advertising.\n\nEnterprise cloud spending looks to be in its early stages of ramping up, which suggests double-digit sales growth can continue for the higher-margin Google Cloud.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably cheaper AI stock than Nvidia is none other than e-commerce titan Amazon.\n\nDespite hitting a fresh 52-week high last week, Amazon ended March 22 at a multiple of only 13 times Wall Street's estimated forward-year cash flow. This represents a 43% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and it's markedly lower then Nvidia's multiple-to-forward-year cash flow.\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online retail platform. The company's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year, which was more than 31 percentage points above its next-closest competitor.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find that online retail sales generate low margins and don't contribute much to Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Rather, the company's ancillary operating segments, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhereas Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global cloud-infrastructure service spending, AWS sits at the top of the pecking order with a 31% share, according to estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is deploying generative AI solutions in a multitude of ways within its cloud platform to allow users to build applications. On an annualized run-rate basis, AWS is generating nearly $97 billion in sales and is consistently responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon's other ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Luring more than 2 billion unique users to its website each month has fueled ad sales for Amazon. Likewise, it crossed above 200 million monthly worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of the National Football League for Thursday Night Football.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to counter the downbeat narrative about a structural slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy got a boost from enthusiastic endorsements from chief executives of top global companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Trump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction Boeing CEO to Step Down in Overhaul Sparked by Safety Crisis\n\nDays after he opened an expansive new retail store in Shanghai and pledged a fresh investment in applied research in the country, Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook on Sunday gushed, “I love it here, I love the Chinese people.”\n\n“It’s so vibrant and so dynamic here,” Cook told journalists as he entered the opening session of the China Development Forum, a top annual gathering of business leaders and Chinese officials. Apple has faced expanding restrictions on iPhone use at government agencies and state-backed companies and sales of the smartphone tumbled 24% in the first six weeks of the year.\n\nThe CDF confab is one of a series this week that offer China a chance to rekindle overseas interest in the nation after an historic slump in foreign investment.\n\nFor global executives, the meetings are a chance to underscore interest in participating in the giant Chinese market despite deepening geopolitical tensions and moves in China to favor local competitors. Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla called China “an extremely attractive place.” Nestle SA’s Mark Schneider lauded plans to boost Chinese consumption.\n\nPremier Li Qiang delivered an address in the Sunday session, assuring attendees at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse that China’s economic recovery has been improving, while recognizing some challenges. Later this week, Beijing hosts the Invest in China summit, followed by the annual Boao Forum for Asia on the southern resort island of Hainan.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: China’s Premier Says Nation Off to Good Start on 2024 Goals\n\nThe glowing remarks by foreign CEOs featured in posts on social media by Hua Chunying, an assistant foreign minister, to her 2.4 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe China Development Forum, which ended Monday, attracted 81 global CEOs to attend in person, largely rebounding to pre-pandemic levels. Li’s speech marked an upgrade of sorts — it’s usually a vice premier who delivers the keynote address — marking a contrast to the premier’s cancellation of a high-profile annual press conference involving the international press earlier this month. A report that Li wouldn’t attend a closed-door meeting with the foreign CEOs also spurred questions about his influence.\n\nScott Kennedy, a China specialist at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies who attended the opening session, offered a mixed review.\n\nLi’s address was “reassuring about demonstrating the Chinese government knows how serious domestic problems they face are — and the difficult geopolitical environment,” Kennedy said. But “there was still insufficient specifics and details around what changes to domestic policy they’ll make, and really no recognition that Chinese policies are generating global anxieties and increasing geostrategic tensions,” he said.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping may offer his own remarks to executives later this week, with a potential sit-down on Wednesday. Meantime, Vice President Han Zheng is scheduled to speak at the Invest In China summit Tuesday.\n\nFor now, overseas business representatives were happy to endorse the messages received.\n\nRead More: China’s Inbound Investment Slows Again Despite Beijing’s Efforts\n\nNestle’s Schneider said Li’s remarks on access for international companies and on bringing back domestic consumption were “music to our ears.” Bourla of Pfizer praised China for having a “coherent, cohesive plan.”\n\nThe People’s Daily newspaper, an official mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, touted the recent flurry of visits by foreign executives in a page-3 commentary on Monday that proclaimed the country as an indispensable market.\n\nWhile International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva called at the forum Sunday for more pro-market reforms, the People’s Daily characterized them as a nod to China’s “new-era of high-quality growth.”\n\nThe IMF chief was joined at the forum by World Bank President Ajay Banga, helping add to an appearance of re-engagement between Washington and Beijing months after the US-China presidential summit in San Francisco. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last year said the IMF and World Bank “reflect American values.” Yellen herself is expected to return for a visit to Beijing soon.\n\nIt marked a notable shift from last year, when a number of overseas corporate leaders were hesitant to attend the forum amid an escalation in US-China tensions.\n\n“It was very important to have the premier here and speaking to business directly,” said Sean Stein, chair of the American Chamber of Commerce China. “The China Development Forum was always seen as the premier’s platform to talk with businesses on what’s happening in the economy, and that exchange goes all the way back to Zhu Rongji days,” he said, referring to a pro-reform former premier.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Increasingly Opt to Retire in Mainland China Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

According to a report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in Africa, the number of international arrivals has been restored to 96% of the pre-pandemic numbers. The recovery is especially evident in North Africa.\n\nThe international arrival rates in North Africa were recorded to be 8% higher, from January till July 2023, compared to 2019 levels. International tourist arrivals exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 28% in Ethiopia, 19% in Tanzania, and 15% in Morroco from January to July 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, Africa was the second-best-performing region in terms of recovery of the number of arrival rates in the world.

Online travel booking services have made planning and booking a trip a very easy process. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global online travel booking services market was valued at around $560 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.0% from 2022 to 2030 to reach a valuation of $1.13 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. The growing demand for online travel booking platforms will be the main driver of the growth of the market.\n\nOne of the main trends in the online booking services industry is the use of artificial intelligence.

        "content": "Steve Jobs is a name synonymous with Apple, the tech giant he co-founded. However, a lesser-known chapter significantly shaped his career and wealth: Pixar Animation Studios. It was Pixar's IPO and the massive success of the movie \"Toy Story\" that made Jobs his first billion, according to reports.\n\nAfter being ousted from Apple in 1985 because of disagreements with the board of directors, Jobs found himself at a crossroads. This pivotal moment in his life led him to Pixar.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share. US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, while contemplating a return to Apple, Jobs confided in Lawrence Levy, a Pixar colleague, expressing doubts about Apple’s future and his potential role in its revival. During this period, Jobs was at the helm of Pixar, having acquired the computer graphics division from Lucasfilm in 1986, and transformed it into an independent studio. Under his leadership as CEO and major shareholder, Pixar revolutionized animation and secured Jobs’s financial legacy.\n\nThe turning point came with Pixar’s initial public offering (IPO) in November 1995, coinciding with the release of “Toy Story,” the studio’s first feature film. The IPO was a resounding success, catapulting Jobs into the ranks of billionaires. According to Cult Of Mac, he called his friend Google co-founder Larry Page and said \"I made it.\"\n\nTrending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nIt was a defining moment that underscored his ability to lead and innovate beyond the realm of personal computing into the entertainment industry. Lawrence Levy’s memoir, “To Pixar and Beyond,” chronicles this journey and the strategic decisions that propelled Pixar into a leading animation studio and, eventually, its acquisition by Disney in 2006 for over $7 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe success at Pixar restored Jobs’s reputation and gave him the confidence to reassume leadership at Apple. His experiences at Pixar, navigating the intricacies of the entertainment industry alongside Levy, provided lessons that Jobs would later apply to Apple’s operations. The synergy between technology and storytelling that defined Pixar’s ethos became a fundamental aspect of Apple’s product development under Jobs’s leadership.\n\nJobs’s venture into animation showcases his multifaceted career, marked by innovation, resilience and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His legacy at Pixar is a testament to his vision of blending technology and art for compelling narratives, a philosophy he carried over to Apple. Through Pixar, Jobs not only redefined animation but set a new standard for leadership and creativity in business, leaving a permanent mark on Silicon Valley and Hollywood.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best tech and disruptive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the tech landscape, head over to Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, resulting in softer consumer spending, reduced product demand, market capitalization declines, and workforce reductions made headlines in 2022. These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloittesuggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers.\n\nKen Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented:\n\n“In 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.”\n\nSimilarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Notwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today’s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.”\n\nIn 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forresterforecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets.\n\nForrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth.\n\nCathie Wood's Latest Thoughts on Innovation Investing\n\nCathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood.

Robo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSE:THNQ) is one of the best tech ETFs to buy.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top holding of Robo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSE:THNQ). On March 19, NVIDIA stock rebounded after CEO Jensen Huang expressed confidence in the company's prospects in the $250 billion data center market during the annual GTC event. He stated that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to capture a significant portion of the accelerated computing market, surpassing competitors like AMD and Intel. Additionally, Huang highlighted the growth potential of Nvidia's software business, particularly with its CUDA platform.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 173 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 180 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel’s semiconductor “fabs” in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.”\n\n9.

Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 113.53%\n\nNext on our list of the best tech ETFs is Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ). The ETF aims to track the performance of the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index.

As of March 19, 2024, Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) holds net assets totaling $1.55 billion and maintains an expense ratio of 0.68%. Its portfolio consists of 84 stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ). On March 18, Mizuho Securities upgraded Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to a top pick with a Buy rating and a $575 price target. Analyst James Lee expects upside surprises in fiscal 2024 revenue, driven by improvements in Reels monetization, geographic expansion, Amazon partnership with Shops, and enhanced video placement optimization. Long-term investments in WhatsApp, generative AI, and the language model Llama could boost revenue per user by up to 65%, according to Lee.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 242 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n6. Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 139.09%\n\nFranklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) is an actively managed fund aiming for capital appreciation through investments in companies advancing automation and task enhancement technologies.

As of March 19, 2024, Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) holds net assets worth $20.08 million, featuring an expense ratio of 0.50% and a portfolio of 57 stocks.\n\nSemiconductor giant ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top holdings of Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM). On March 11, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and other semiconductor equipment firms saw a boost in 2023 due to heightened demand from China, but potential domestic substitutions may impact future gains, according to Bernstein Research. Bernstein raised ASML's price target to $1,072 from $963 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 5 million shares worth $3.76 million.\n\nIn addition to Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best tech stocks to invest in.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US 20 Biggest Energy Companies in Australia for 2024 Billionaire Steve Cohen and Insiders Are Buying These 10 Stocks\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US. If you want to skip our discussion about the tech industry, visit the Top 7 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US.\n\nThe worldwide expenditure on technology is projected to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. This depicts an expected 7.75% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years starting in 2022 when the yearly spending on technology was $8,51 trillion.\n\nAlthough the tech industry faced some challenges in 2023, it forged forward and came out strong. The year was also marked by considerable anticipation regarding the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, in the year 2024, companies are looking to prioritize AI in their strategies to surpass competitors.\n\nThis is the year of AI deals and partnerships which could shape the future. It is already being reported that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Gemini-powered features on iPhones. Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google.\n\nMoving forward, spending on software and IT services backed by cloud computing and cyber security is expected to dominate the market. Tech companies will continue to experiment with different AI-related applications. In a survey by Deloitte, 52% of tech leaders stated that AI will be the primary technology in 2024. At 47%, an overwhelming proportion of tech leaders also vouched for could computing. In addition, 27% of the respondents were confident that AI will be a game changer for companies in 2024.\n\nThe United States is at the forefront of global technology and innovation. It sets the pace for advancements in various sectors. The country also has a whopping 36% share of the global information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In addition, the Consumer Technology Association anticipates that retail revenues for the US consumer technology industry will increase by 2.8% in 2024, reaching $512 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the year 2023 came with challenges for the tech sector, there were big gains for leading tech stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), fueled by the AI boom. Analysts believe that tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation. A new era of gains that started with the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 will continue to reap positive results for the tech sector way beyond 2024.\n\nAI is also helping small and mid-cap tech companies make their mark by disrupting larger companies. Theia Insights is one of the examples of small companies with the potential to disrupt entire industries with the help of AI. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of information through AI, and help investors make better decisions. Theia Insights recently also raised $6.5 million.\n\nAnother AI-related trend in the tech industry is forming partnerships, both within and outside the sector. We have already seen how Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are reported to be in negotiation to integrate generative AI in iPhones. Interestingly, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares went up by 4% following these reports.\n\nAI is also compelling tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to partner outside their industry, particularly in the form of vendor and end-user industries collaboration. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India, to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.

        "title": "Explainer-Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act?",
        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.\n\nLast year, Brussels designated six companies as \"gatekeepers\" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThey were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.\n\nBelow is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:\n\nANTI-STEERING:\n\nTwo of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around \"anti-steering\" behaviour.\n\nWhenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.\n\nTo get around this, app developers sometimes \"steer\" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.\n\nApple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.\n\nThe EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify, which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.\n\nBeyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.\n\nStory continues\n\nSELF-PREFERENCING:\n\nIn bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.\n\nThat becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.\n\nAnother of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking.com or Skyscanner.\n\nThe EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.\n\nThe EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.\n\nThe law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a \"pay or be tracked\" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.\n\nFollowing questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.\n\nOn Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.\n\nWHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?\n\nGoogle, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" Meta said.\n\n($1 = 0.9233 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

        "title": "RPT-UPDATE 3-Apple, Google, Meta targeted in EU's first Digital Markets Act probes",
        "content": "(Repeats to more subscribers)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer\n\nBRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies. The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover. U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.\n\nTech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six \"gatekeepers\" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices. But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.\n\nAsked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.\n\n\"The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,\" he told a press conference.\n\nAPPLE COMPLIANCE\n\nAt issue is whether Apple complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.\n\nAnother concern for regulators is \"steering\": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes. Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.\n\nFEES OR NO FEES\n\nThe Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's \"free of charge\" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.\n\nBreton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" the spokesperson said. Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.\n\nThe Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon's ranking practices on its marketplace.\n\nAmazon is another DMA \"gatekeeper\", along with Microsoft and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\n\"Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.\"\n\nThe EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.\n\nThe EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bart Meijer; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Catherine Evans)",

        "title": "20 Least Densely Populated States in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 least densely populated states in the US. If you would like to skip our discussion on the population trends in the US, you can go to the 5 Least Densely Populated States in the US.\n\nThe United States of America has the third largest population in the world, accounting for roughly 4.23% of the global population. The population density in the US stands at 36 people per square kilometer, which is considerably lower than densely populated countries like China and India. Population distribution across the US varies significantly. For instance, New Jersey and Rhode Island have population densities of 1263 and 1061.4 people per square mile, respectively, ranking them among the most densely populated states. Conversely, Wyoming is among the states with low population densities, at 5.9 people per square mile.\n\nTypically, Northeastern states like Massachusetts and Connecticut are densely populated, with population densities as high as 901.2 and 744.1 people per square mile, respectively. In contrast, Midwestern states and certain Southern states such as Mississippi, Kansas, Minnesota, and North Dakota tend to have lower population densities. This disparity is attributed to factors such as greater land availability, fewer urban centers, and more sparsely populated areas in these regions.\n\nUrban Population Dynamics\n\nLarge urban centers are more densely populated in the USA. According to the US Census Bureau, the overall population density of urbanized areas sits at approximately 2,534.4 people per square mile. This national figure, however, masks significant variations. Megacities like New York City have densities exceeding 27,000 people per square mile, reflecting a concentration of towering skyscrapers, bustling commercial districts, and limited land availability. Many major cities like Chicago and Philadelphia fall within a 10,000 to 20,000 people per square mile range, offering a balance between urban facilities and breathing room. In comparison, population densities in suburban areas can be significantly lower, sometimes dropping below 1,000 people per square mile.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the high population density in urban areas. One of these factors is the availability of job opportunities and the presence of popular companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Job growth is increasing in major US cities while the workforce is decreasing in rural areas. In fact, there has been a larger decrease in workforce participation in non-metro areas, leading to a slower recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Studies, such as those conducted by the Manhattan Institute, highlight the presence of education and cultural centers, infrastructure, diverse services, transportation access, and healthcare availability as factors contributing to the concentration of population in urban areas.\n\nHowever, urban areas face their fair share of challenges that lead individuals to relocate to the suburbs. A major issue is the lack of affordable housing. High demand in dense areas can outstrip housing supply, pushing up rents and homeownership costs, potentially leading to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents. A report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a full-time minimum wage worker cannot afford a two-bedroom rental apartment in a major city, highlighting the affordability challenges in dense areas. 20 Least Densely Populated States in the US\n\nArthimedes/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe made a list of the 20 least densely populated states in the US, using average population per square mile data from the US Census Bureau.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program took a jab at the Department of Justice and Washington authorities in general, calling regulators “anti-innovation” who have “contempt” against those who became rich in the technology sector. Cramer was referring to the DoJ’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accused the iPhone maker of  throttling competitive alternatives from other companies and trying to maintain a monopoly in the smartphone market. Cramer said that the regulators hate and “abhor” big businesses because the bigger they are the more successful they become. Jim Cramer, who has been repeatedly recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) during his programs, uring investors to “hold it, not trade it,” said that Washington’s “anti-business bias” was evident when it brought the lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on what Cramer called a “shameful day.”\n\nWhy Cramer Loves Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) So Much?\n\nCramer then highlighted the reasons why he’s been so bullish on Apple, and these thoughts provide an interesting sneak peek into what goes on in Cramer’s mind when he’s choosing stocks for the long-term. Cramer said he did not ask his viewers to hold Apple stock for the long term because it’s a stock with a relatively low P/E ratio or because it has “got the hottest technology out there?” These were not the reasons behind Cramer’s bullish outlook on Apple. Cramer said he recommended holding onto Apple shares because it’s the “most innovative consumer products technology company ever.”\n\nCramer Thinks DoJ Has a \"Loser Case\" Against Apple\n\nIn a blunt move, Cramer grabbed a copy of the DoJ’s case against Apple and threw it away, calling it a “loser” case which does not hold any merit. Cramer said that he isn’t worried at all about the DoJ’s case against Apple because he knows a “loser case” when he “sees it.” According to Cramer, Apple pays the “most taxes” and creates the “most jobs.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer said the pullback in Apple shares after the case was expected, but he sees it as a buying opportunity which long-term investors would look back to and thank the Department of Justice for.\n\nWhile Jim Cramer is recommending investors to pile into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in addition to other tech names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), he is bearish on some stocks. In this article we will take a look at the stocks he's recommending investors to stay away from. Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\n11. Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 5\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about midstream energy infrastructure company Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA). Cramer said:\n\n“I see you, and I raise you with Enterprise Products Partners.”\n\nCramer also said that Enterprise Products Partners is a “better” company than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA).\n\nLast month, during its earnings call, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA) management talked about guidance and expectations:\n\n\"Looking at 2024 compared to 2023 and as illustrated by the EBITDA walk on Slide 9, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.625 billion to $2.725 billion with year-over-year growth in our Crude Oil segment, partially offsetting commodity price headwinds in our NGL segment. Growth in our Crude Oil segment is primarily driven by anticipated tariff volume increases, higher fees from tariff escalators and full year contributions from bolt-on acquisitions. This is partially offset by our assumption of fewer market-based opportunities. We expect lower year-over-year NGL segment adjusted EBITDA, driven by lower forecasted frac spreads, partially offset by higher C3 plus spec product sales in 2024. I would note that our C3 plus spec product sales volumes are approximately 90% hedged for the year in the mid $0.60 per gallon level.\n\nWe remain disciplined with our capital investments with approximately $375 million of growth capital and approximately $230 million of maintenance capital expected for the year, net to PAA. This includes capital for POP JV well connections and intra-basin improvement as well as an increase in our capital related to our previously announced Fort Sask debottleneck project. As illustrated on Slide 10 and in addition to a capital discipline, we remain committed to significant returns of capital and maintaining financial ability. For 2024, we expect to generate $1.65 billion of adjusted free cash flow excluding changes in assets and liabilities with approximately $1.15 billion to be allocated to common and preferred distributions inclusive of the respective increases resulting in $500 million of adjusted free cash flow after distributions available for value-creating opportunities, including potential bolt-on acquisitions or net debt reduction.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n10. Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nAI-based voice technology solutions company Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another stock Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from for now. While Cramer has expressed excitement about the stock in the past because of Soundhound AI Inc's (NASDAQ:SOUN) partnership with Nvidia, the CNBC host recently said that he won’t buy the stock even at $6 (the stock was trading at around $6.14 as of March 25).\n\nOut of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 13 hedge funds had stakes in Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\n9. Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nTexas-based energy company Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently avoiding. When asked about Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) during the Lightning Round segment of his program on CNBC, Cramer said that there are “so many better” companies than Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK).\n\n“I’m going to have to refer you to get to Coterra, CTRA, which is just a better situation.”\n\nInsider Monkey’s database of 933 funds shows that 18 hedge funds had stakes in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) as of the end of the last quarter of 2023. The most notable stake in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) is owned by Todd J. Kantor’s Encompass Capital Advisors which owns a $31 million stake in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK).\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on CRK, he's recommending investors to pile into  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings call, the company talked about 2024 guidance:\n\n\"First quarter D&C CapEx guidance is $225 million to $275 million and the full year D&C CapEx guidance is $750 million to $850 million. The lower spending versus last year is related to the announced release of two drilling rigs in our press release last night in response to low gas prices. We’ve continued to see signs of some deflationary pressures on service costs, including an improvement in our completion costs per stage. We anticipate spending an additional $30 million to $40 million on lease acquisitions in the first quarter and $40 million to $50 million over the course of the year. Capital expenditures related to Pinnacle Gas Services will be funded by our midstream partner and are expected to total $30 million to $40 million in the first quarter and $125 million to $150 million for the full year.\n\nFor both the first quarter and the full year, our LOE is expected to be in a range of $0.24 to $0.28 per Mcfe. GTC are expected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per Mcfe and production and ad valorem taxes are expected to average $0.16 to $0.20 per Mcfe. DD&A rate is expected to average $1.30 to $1.40 per Mcf this year. In the first quarter, our cash G&A is expected to total $7 million to $9 million and $30 million to $34 million for the full year. In addition, we’ll have non-cash G&A in the first quarter of $2.7 million to $3 million and $10 million to $12 million for the full year. With the increase in SOFR rates in our current debt levels, cash interest expense is now expected to total $43 million to $47 million in the first quarter and $195 million to $205 million for the year, while non-cash interest will remain approximately $2 million per quarter.\n\nEffective tax rate will remain in the 22% to 25% range and we continue to expect to defer 95% to 100% of our reported taxes this year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8.

Cramer recently said during his program that Mannkind Corp (NSDAQ:MNKD) has been “hanging out there forever.” Cramer however acknowledged that it’s “finally” starting to look like Mannkind Corp (NSDAQ:MNKD) will have an “earnings breakout.”\n\n“But I am one of those people who’s jaundiced about it. I got to wait to see if they come up with something.”\n\nCramer said that for now he cannot just say that the stock is looking better.\n\n“I’m not gonna go there,” Cramer added.\n\n7. iRobot Corp (NASDAQ:IRBT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nConsumer robots company iRobot Corp (NASDAQ:IRBT) stock is among the ones  Jim Cramer is bearish on.

        "title": "Consumers sue Apple, taking page from US Justice Department lawsuit",
        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - Apple has been hit with a flurry of new consumer lawsuits accusing the iPhone maker of monopolizing the smartphone market, piggybacking on a sweeping antitrust case lodged by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states last week.\n\nAt least three proposed class actions have been filed since Friday in California and New Jersey federal courts by iPhone owners who claim Apple inflated the cost of its products through anticompetitive conduct.\n\nThe lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets and other items that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones.\n\nApple has denied the government's allegations. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consumer lawsuits.\n\nAttorney Steve Berman, whose law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro filed one of the new cases, noted that his firm had earlier sued Apple for allegedly thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.\n\n\"We are pleased that the DOJ (Department of Justice) agrees with our approach,\" Berman said.\n\nAttorneys behind the other new cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nApple is already fighting private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive. A judge in February ruled that Apple must face a class action on behalf of millions of consumers claiming it monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple denies the claims.\n\nHagens Berman previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases related to its ebook pricing and app store policies.\n\nA 2022 study by a University of Buffalo law school professor found that private antitrust class actions can sometimes go farther than government cases, expanding \"the scope of wrongdoing, the amount of recovery, or the number of defendants involved.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Will Dunham and David Bario)",

        "title": "Steve Jobs-signed business card from 1983 sells for $181,000",
        "content": "It has been 13 years since Steve Jobs died, but the Apple founder’s celebrity hasn’t faded one bit.\n\nAn auction this weekend had a collection of rare Jobs-signed items and each one went for a premium—but none more so than a 1983 business card, which sold for $181,183. That’s considerably more than the $10,000+ RR Auction had expected it to sell for.\n\nThe card was a rarity and one of the earliest business cards bearing Jobs’ signature. To date, there are fewer than five Jobs-signed Apple Computer business cards that have been authenticated.\n\n“The sale of the Steve Jobs-signed Apple business card for over $180,000 sets a new standard in autographed business cards,” said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction, in a statement. “It’s a testament to the enduring legacy of Jobs and the profound impact of Apple on our modern world.”\n\nFetching just a bit less was a check signed by Jobs. In 1976, that check was worth $13.86 to Elmar Electronics. It sold for $176,850. The check pre-dated the official founding of Apple Computer. It was likely used to purchase electronic components that were used in the construction of the first Apple-1 prototypes. Because the company did not yet officially exist, Jobs wrote “Apple Computer” as well as the address of his Palo Alto garage in the top left corner.\n\nThe pre-auction estimate for the check was $50,000+.\n\nJobs typically did not sign autographs, but made an exception for a random fan in 2003 who swapped his seat during a showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl so Jobs and his family could all sit together.\n\n“I was seated at the back of the room patiently waiting for the movie to begin when a man accompanied by some children tapped on my shoulder and kindly asked me if I could move by one seat so that they could all comfortably sit together. I gladly accepted and while I was moving, I suddenly realized that I had just spoken to Steve Jobs,” read a letter from the original recipient that accompanied the item. “I did not want to potentially upset him before he could happily enjoy the movie, so I chose to wait until we were leaving the room to address him. … His response was ‘Sure’ and as I had no paper on me, the only thing I could hand him was a pen and my movie ticket that he signed in the palm of his hand.”\n\nThat ticket stub sold for $14,653.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to buy for grandchildren. To skip the detailed analysis of financial markets and analysts’ outlook, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren.\n\nThe world held its breath for almost three years as the global financial markets and economy suffered from one shock after another. The bears were sure that the US economy would be hit by a recession in 2023 or 2024, but the market proved all their predictions wrong and made an impressive comeback on the back of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile the bulls are quite optimistic about the future, there are still concerns regarding a soft landing or a mild recession. A JPMorgan report points out that there are indications of slowing growth in the current year but not a total collapse and still holds the belief that a mild recession could take place in the next year. The report states:\n\n“The challenge for investors: the damage to public sector finances from mega-deficits, markets that already price in a very soft landing and the concentrated contribution of megacap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings were flat; they were up 33% for the 7 megacap stocks and down 5% across the rest of the S&P 500. All things considered, 2024 looks like a year of slowing GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth and single-digit returns on the median S&P 500 stock.”\n\nOn a global scale, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report also contains revisions regarding the IMF’s October 2023 predictions and states that the global growth is expected to be 3.1% in 2024, up 0.2% from the IMF's October predictions. The IMF predicts a 3.2% growth in 2025. Furthermore, it is believed that global headline inflation is expected to fall by 5.8% in the current year and 4.4% in 2025.\n\nIn this economic environment and volatility, millions of American families would wonder how they could help their children and grandchildren secure their financial future. One of the best ways to do that would be to teach them money management. According to the Wall Street legend, Warren Buffett, sometimes parents start teaching financial literacy to their children later than they should. He said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”\n\nBuying stocks for your children or grandchildren is also a good way to secure their financial future. Value stocks are some of the best options when looking at long-term investments. They are stocks of companies that are considered to be undervalued compared to their intrinsic value or potential for growth. Value stocks have also been endorsed by Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel for the current year. In a CNBC interview, he mentioned the abnormal gap between the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value. Based on that, he predicts a 15% gain in value stocks in 2024. Additionally, the best stocks to buy for grandchildren could include stocks with healthy long-term dividends.

Lilly’s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas.

        "content": "apple\n\nApple, Meta and Google face the risk of fines worth billions of euros as the European Union launched its first major investigations into compliance of new Big Tech laws.\n\nMargrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton, the EU’s competition and digital markets chiefs, announced five investigations into the three companies on Monday.\n\nThey concern areas including the companies’ smartphone app stores and Meta charging a monthly fee to users in Europe who do not want to see adverts on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt comes less than three weeks after the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force. The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers – Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn). It comes just weeks after it was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.\n\nThe investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.\n\nThe European Commission said Meta’s fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.\n\nMr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, in the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets that took effect earlier this month.\n\nThe European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services” by forcing them to comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable\" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.\n\nThe commission said in a press release that it “suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.”\n\nIt's looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to offers available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.\n\nGoogle is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”\n\nThe commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers. It's also looking into Meta's option for users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.\n\n“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.",

She notes that the S&P 500 appears to have gained year-over-year, but without the Magnificent Seven, the market actually reported a loss.</p>\\n<p>Agati recommends that investors adopt a \\\"defensive\\\" approach, meaning they should stay fairly diversified and focusing on long-term goals, \\\"while being very valuation conscious.\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/trump-truth-social-public-dwac-170711762.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.</p>\\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/angel-smith/\\\"><em>Angel Smith</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AwNu2Wn46H.QLO3r49r1Ug--~B/aD0zMjA5O3c9NTcwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/d7c90040-e886-11ee-bfee-d9d0f654cea0\",\"duration\":\"PT3M\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/0d1671d6-1554-3f13-8b65-124fd4a27600.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-stay-valuation-conscious-strategist-204355469.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"0d1671d6-1554-3f13-8b65-124fd4a27600\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFollowing monumental gains, Super Micro Computer has found itself on the chopping block\n\nOne company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.\n\nSuper Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares sold Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares sold Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares sold\n\nWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.\n\nBut while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSteven Cohen adds time-tested, bubble-resistant AI stocks\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchased\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nSelling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.\n\nKen Griffin piles into the infrastructure backbones of the AI movement\n\nA second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:\n\nNvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchased Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchased\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.\n\nAt the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.\n\nGriffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.\n\nDon't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.\n\nIsrael Englander opts for a couple Magnificent Seven components\n\nThe final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\n\nBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.\n\nAlphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.\n\nBut Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.\n\nHowever, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

China and the United States are expected to lead this boom in the AI world. AI will contribute to a nearly 30% increase in total GDP output from China by 2030, with North America following behind at around 15%. AI growth trends can be seen in context of the ChatGPT craze. The application became the fastest-growing in history by hitting 100 million active users within a month of launch.\n\nSome of the most promising applications for AI include uses in wearable technology, chip market solutions, self-driving cars, and automated medical procedures, among a host of other applications in the business world. Global Market Insights estimates that the wearable AI market will reach close to $200 billion in value by the end of next year. Similarly, more than 8 billion digital voice assistants could be in use worldwide by the end of this year. The global AI chip market will reach close to $100 billion in value within the next three years.\n\nBig companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing heavily in AI products to take advantage of this AI evolution. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), recently highlighted some of the efforts his company was making in this regard during the first quarter earnings call at the beginning of February.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that stand to benefit from the increased adoption of AI products and related services were selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution\n\nA portfolio manager studying various stocks and other securities on a tablet.\n\nStocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution\n\n11.

        "title": "Apple’s Cook Tells China Forum AI Is Key for Climate Battle",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said artificial intelligence is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog Sunday at the China Development Forum.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarassment and Drugs Plagued a Citigroup Division for Years US Homebuyers Expecting $10,000 Savings Face Tough Reality Gucci’s China Shock Reverberates Across the Luxury Landscape Fed’s Powell Ready to Support Job Market, Even If It Means Lingering Inflation\n\nCook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company’s commitment to China. He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple’s supply chain, stores and research in the country.\n\nApple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint — with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon neutral product. Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.\n\n“We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,” Cook said of the company’s environmental goals. Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.\n\nAI “provides an enormous toolkit for every company that’s wishing to be carbon neutral or to lower their emissions by a substantial amount,” the 63-year-old CEO said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person’s carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.\n\nLike Apple, China’s leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest, however US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year’s list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China Premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li’s opening speech.\n\nStory continues\n\nCook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because “it’s so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming.” His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.\n\nRead More: Apple CEO Arrives in China Touting Its Role as iPhone Base\n\n“To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,” Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co., Lens Technology Co. and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.\n\nThe environmental theme to Cook’s trip — which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai on Thursday — may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the US and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner doesn’t divest.\n\nApple has been on the receiving end of China’s riposte, as it’s had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.\n\nThe company’s global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.\n\nApple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 metric tons of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network. It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly in China.\n\n(Updates with details of Cook’s visit from second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Here's My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for Long-Term Investors to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have dominated investing headlines recently, as this exclusive group of megacap companies are in a league of their own and have mostly delivered strong performance recently.\n\nWhile Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has certainly been the most exciting Magnificent Seven stock to watch so far in 2024, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been in a two-way race for the title of the largest market cap in the U.S. stock market, I wouldn't be surprised if the best performer in the Magnificent Seven over the next five to 10 years was Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nThe two sides of Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, and for good reason. In addition to the Google Search business, which is dominant in its industry, Google also has Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android mobile operating system, just to name a few. These collectively are known as the Google Services business. In fact, I've used four different Google products in the process of writing this article. This is a massive business that generates a ton of reliable, high-margin income.\n\nThe other main part of the business is Google Cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure provider that competes with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. It has the number three market share right now but is growing fast.\n\nAlphabet could be a big long-term winner\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money from ad sales, especially on the Google Services side of the business, and there could be more potential for growth here than it seems. Thanks to evolving AI technology, Alphabet is continually getting better at targeting ads more effectively, which inherently makes them more valuable. Plus, while there is certainly limited growth potential in its search business, that's not the case for some of Alphabet's other ad-driven platforms, such as YouTube.\n\nGoogle Cloud is definitely the more interesting part of the business from a growth perspective. It makes up less than 11% of the company's total revenue today, but is also the fastest growing part of Alphabet, with 26% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. In fact, as recently as 2018, Google Cloud made up just over 4% of the company's total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could just be the starting point. The cloud computing market is estimated to be $676 billion in size today but is expected to roughly quadruple to $2.3 trillion by 2032. If Google Cloud can simply maintain its market share, this could be a big growth driver, but recent data indicates that Google Cloud is gaining on the market leaders.\n\nTremendous profitability and a reasonable valuation\n\nIt's also worth noting that Alphabet has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which combined with the more than $80 billion in annualized net income it generated in the most recent quarter gives it tremendous financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise.\n\nWith a valuation of about 22 times forward earnings, I wouldn't exactly call Alphabet a cheap stock, although it is easily the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven by this metric. However, it does seem attractively valued for a market-leading and highly profitable business growing revenue at a double-digit rate. Alphabet is a rare combination of a dominant core business and a rapidly growing secondary business with massive, long-tailed growth potential. And while it isn't the largest stock in the Magnificent Seven today, I wouldn't be at all shocked for that to change within the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 4 Worst-Performing Dow Stocks in 2024 (and It Could Get Worse Before It Gets Better)",
        "content": "The broader stock market continues to roar higher. But 11 of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down this year.\n\nThe worst performers, in order, are Boeing (NYSE: BA), Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), Nike (NYSE: NKE), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- which may come as a surprise, since the broader semiconductor industry and many big tech growth stocks are flying high.\n\nHere's what's dragging down each blue-chip stock, and why it could get worse before it gets better. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBoeing must fix its major issues even at the expense of its near-term performance\n\nBoeing has not had a good 2024. On Jan. 5, a Boeing 737-9 MAX door plug came off mid-flight. Since then, Boeing has been scrambling to restore confidence and ensure safety.\n\nOn Jan. 24, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that it would halt Boeing MAX's production expansion and investigate Boeing's maintenance and quality control.\n\nOn March 4, the FAA \"...found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. The FAA identified non-compliance issues in Boeing's manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.\"\n\nOn March 20, Boeing said that it would slow production and burn more cash in an effort to improve quality.\n\nCases like this are never good, especially when they have to do with safety. As for the company, Boeing's 2025/2026 medium-term targets are in jeopardy. Boeing was guiding for $10 billion in annual free cash flow during that time frame, but it will probably miss that goal now.\n\nBoeing continues to hit speed bumps along an increasingly uncertain runway. The stock got crushed during the COVID-19 pandemic as travel ground to a halt. It largely missed out on the broader market rally, and remains down over 57% from its all-time high.\n\nBoeing used to be the most heavily weighted stock in the Dow. But now it is closer to the median. Investor patience is running out, and the stock could struggle before staging a turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is moving in the right direction\n\nIntel had a fantastic year in 2023, surging 90%. The recovery was mainly due to investor optimism that Intel is finally on track. But that doesn't mean its precious wasted opportunities are completely forgotten.\n\nIntel is an excellent example of why the top dog in a dynamic industry can lose its throne in a relatively short period of time. Intel lost market share in the CPU market and missed out on the AI-driven GPU boom. Intel believes it can unlock growth in the foundry business and become the second-largest foundry by 2030.\n\nSize isn't the only differencing factor. Supported by government funding, Intel is building foundries across the United States to onshore semiconductor production. This presents an opportunity for American chip makers to reduce the geopolitical risks of relying too much on Taiwan. Granted, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also investing in U.S. fabs.\n\nIntel stock was left for dead but now has hope. After last year's run-up, it's understandable why the stock would pull back given that much of its potential growth is years away.\n\nMajor challenges for Nike\n\nNike is facing two key threats. The first is slowing growth out of China. On its Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call, Nike revised its full-year revenue guidance to just 1% growth compared to fiscal 2023. Softness out of China, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa was largely responsible for the revision.\n\nNike has always dealt with competition, but it seems to be ramping up in recent years. Lululemon sustained breakneck growth and is now worth nearly 40% as much as Nike. Smaller footwear and apparel brands like On Holding and Hoka have taken the market by storm. Hoka is owned by Deckers Outdoor, which also owns UGG and Teva.\n\nNike is a bigger company, so moving the needle is harder. But still, trailing 12-month revenue is up just 15.8% over the last three years, which is a bad look compared to Lululemon, On, and Deckers. NKE Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNike relies heavily on massive marketing expenses and its brand. Perception is everything when it comes to charging a premium price for what is ultimately just a commodity.\n\nThe good news is that the valuation has come down. Nike's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now just 29.3, which is far lower than the five-year median of 34.6.\n\nNike is too good of a company to trade at a discount to the market. Value investors will eventually step in and swoop up shares, but the bulk of Nike's sell-off thus far is justified.\n\nApple is pulling out the stops to offset slow growth\n\nApple's sell-off also makes sense. The growth rate of the stock price has far exceeded profit growth, which has made the stock more expensive. AAPL data by YCharts\n\nApple is dealing with slowing growth out of China and decent growth elsewhere. However, optimistic investors hope that Apple has a hidden backlog in the form of customers who have older iPhone models and are overdue for an upgrade. This pent-up demand could help Apple get back on track. But the fact remains that iPhone sales growth slowed dramatically, and Apple's business model still greatly depends on the iPhone. And a recent development demands attention -- the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Apple accusing it of illegally stifling competition and violating antitrust laws to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and less likely to switch to another device.\n\nTo its credit, Apple's high-margin services segment is thriving and continues to put up record results. Apple also bought back a considerable amount of stock, which has helped its earnings per share (EPS) growth outpace net income growth. The impact of stock buybacks doesn't always appear in the short term. But given the pace at which Apple repurchases shares, you can begin to see the divergence over the medium term.\n\nReferring back to the chart, consider that Apple's net income is up 76.5% over the last five years but EPS is up 116% thanks to buybacks. Apple's steadfast buybacks make the stock a better value even when growth is slow.\n\nOut of all the companies on this list, Apple stands out as the best long-term investment because parts of the business are doing well, it has a rock-solid balance sheet and plenty of cash to make an acquisition to fuel growth if needed, and it remains a market leader.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Warren Buffett Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Keep an Eye On",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, despite long avoiding the technology sector, has made Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) the largest holding at the conglomerate he heads, Berkshire Hathaway. No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.\n\nBut during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.\n\nPlaying coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.\n\nBelow I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race\n\nMicrosoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.\n\nBut Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments. Image source: Getty Images\n\nIs Apple moving too slowly?\n\nWhile Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.\n\nKeep an eye out for more details\n\nApple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.\n\nAt the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.\n\nWorking with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.\n\nThis is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.\n\nHowever, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.\n\nGiven Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.\n\nIf your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds remarks from Apple CEO in paragraph 11)\n\nBy Colleen Howe and Jing Xu\n\nBEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - China needs to \"reinvent itself\" with economic policies to speed resolution of its property market crisis and boost domestic consumption and productivity, the International Monetary Fund's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday. \"China faces a fork in the road — rely on the policies that have worked in the past, or reinvent itself for a new era of high-quality growth,\" Georgieva said in remarks to a meeting of senior Chinese officials and executives from global companies.\n\nOfficials who spoke at the opening of the China Development Forum expressed confidence China would hit its economic targets, including growth of about 5% this year, and pledged further support for companies in strategically important sectors, an area Chinese President Xi Jinping has dubbed \"new productive forces.\"\n\nBut those commitments stopped short of the more sweeping changes urged by the IMF. Georgieva said an analysis by the IMF showed a more consumer-centered policy mix could add $3.5 trillion to China's economy over the next 15 years. If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.\n\nTo do that China would need to take \"decisive\" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.\n\n\"A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,\" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. \"Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.\"\n\nOther economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message China is open for business.\n\nForeign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the first two months of the year, data released Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to \"de-risk\" supply chains and operations away from China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8%, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an \"outstanding\" meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang.\n\nCook was quoted in state-run CCTV Finance saying that Apple's Vision Pro will hit the mainland China market this year and that the company will continue to ramp up research and development investment in China.\n\n\"I think China is really opening up,\" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals like aluminum and cobalt.\n\nStephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.\n\n\"Any wording and hype about an exodus in the supply chain is not what we follow,\" he said in remarks published by CGTN. \"We're invested. We're here to stay.\"\n\nOver 100 overseas executives and investors were attending the China Development Forum and a series of smaller closed-door sessions with Chinese officials on Friday and Saturday.\n\nChina's cabinet last week unveiled steps intended to win investment, including expanded market access and pilot programmes to encourage investment in science and technology.\n\nOn Sunday, Li said China's previously announced $140-billion plan to issue ultra-long bonds would create a fund to spur investment and stabilise growth.\n\nOther officials highlighted Xi's commitment to drive investment in \"new productive forces,\" industries that officials have said includes networked electric vehicles, spaceflight and cutting-edge drug development.

        "title": "This Is the Next \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Pay a Dividend (and It Could Be the Biggest of the Bunch)",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't exactly know for their dividends but rather for their growth. But if a company's payout can grow by double digits for a large number of years, investing in leading tech growth stocks today could yield some impressive retirement income decades down the road.\n\nWhat could be even more lucrative? If you own a high-growth stock that begins to start paying a dividend after you've owned it for a number of years. When this fortunate event happens, one has probably already seen a large appreciation in the stock, so even a small nominal yield can amount to a substantial payout relative to one's initial investment.\n\nOf the three remaining Mag Seven stocks that don't pay a dividend, I'd say it's a pretty solid bet which one will be next. Not only that, but its potential payout could offer the highest yield of the group when it begins.\n\nAlphabet is a cash cow that should really pay a dividend\n\nWith exception of perhaps Apple and Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet is the Magnificent Seven stock with the greatest capacity to pay a dividend -- and yet it doesn't.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet generated a massive $74 billion in net income, which is the third highest profit figure of the Mag Seven. And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft's $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.\n\nCompany Net Income (TTM) Dividend Yield  Payout Ratio Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $100.9 billion 0.55% 14.8% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $82.5 billion 0.71% 25.2% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) $73.8 billion 0% 0% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $39.1 billion 0.40% 13.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $29.8 billion 0.16% 1.3%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion.\n\nTo its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.\n\nBut all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out.\n\nSome may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds.\n\nReasons to not pay a dividend\n\nOf course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.\n\nI think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nYet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time.\n\nStill, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments.\n\nAlphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various \"moonshot\" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.\n\nA dividend is probably coming at some point\n\nOnce Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.\n\nWhile it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Costco: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Retail is one of the best markets for long-term investment, known for its consistent growth. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. In fact, the global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) has enjoyed immense success, with its shares up 213% since 2019. The company's wholesale business model has won over consumers in more than a dozen countries and has an exciting outlook as it continues to expand.\n\nHowever, it's hard to consider Costco's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) also exist. These companies lead their respective areas of retail and hold the first and third biggest market shares in e-commerce. AAPL Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Amazon and Apple have significantly outperformed Costco's stock over the last decade, suggesting they could be better long-term buys. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple are investing heavily in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI), which could keep them on their current growth trajectories.\n\nSo, forget Costco and buy these unstoppable stocks instead.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOne of the best reasons to invest in Amazon is its proven reliability under strain.\n\nAn economic downturn in 2022 caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% during the year. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\n\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and has seen its free cash flow skyrocket 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows that Amazon's earnings could hit about $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Costco's may achieve $19 per share. On the surface, it looks like Costco is the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 43 and Costco's 47) yields stock prices of $296 for Amazon and $902 for Costco.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections will see Amazon's stock rise 66% and Costco's 21% by fiscal 2026. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and growing prospects in AI, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer right now.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.\n\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. Apple's free cash flow hit $107 billion last year, significantly higher than Costco's $6 billion. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing the company to continue investing in its business.\n\nApple has hit some roadblocks over the last year as it had to contend with reductions in consumer spending, restrictions on its products in China, and issues with Apple Watch patents. However, the company's outlook remains strong, with considerable cash reserves and expansions into lucrative sectors like AI and virtual reality. COST PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe table above shows that Apple's stock is a bargain compared to Costco's shares. Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow are considerably less than Costco's, indicating Apple is trading at a far better value.\n\nThese are two helpful valuation metrics. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAs a result, Apple's stock is worth considering right now, especially over Costco.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

If achieved, that boost would be equivalent to adding output equivalent to more twice the size of South Korea's economy.\n\nTo do that China would need to take \"decisive\" steps to complete unfinished housing stranded by bankrupt developers and to reduce risks from local government debt, the IMF chief said.\n\n\"A key feature of high quality growth will need to be higher reliance on domestic consumption,\" Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, said. \"Doing so depends on boosting the spending power of individuals and families.\"\n\nOther economists have also urged a new growth model for China. But the IMF remarks were significant in coming at the outset of a two-day meeting where Beijing is looking to push the message China is open for business.\n\nStory continues\n\nForeign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the first two months of the year, data released Friday showed, and officials have been stepping up efforts to attract investors at a time when many companies have been looking to \"de-risk\" supply chains and operations away from China.\n\nIn 2023, foreign direct investment into China contracted by 8%, reflecting a shaky economic recovery and tensions with the United States and its allies on a range of issues.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, the highest-profile executive at the Beijing event, told China state broadcaster CGTN he had an \"outstanding\" meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang.\n\n\"I think China is really opening up,\" Cook told a CGTN interviewer on the sidelines of the meeting. He later said Apple's China-based suppliers had helped deliver gains in more sustainable manufacturing, including lowering water use and recycling metals like aluminum and cobalt.\n\nStephen von Schuckmann, a board member and executive at ZF Group who oversees the auto supplier's battery-drive operations, said the company was committed to China, which leads the world in electric car sales and production.\n\n\"Any wording and hype about an exodus in the supply chain is not what we follow,\" he said in remarks published by CGTN. \"We're invested. We're here to stay.\"\n\nOver 100 overseas executives and investors were attending the China Development Forum and a series of smaller closed-door sessions with Chinese officials on Friday and Saturday.\n\nChina's cabinet last week unveiled steps intended to win investment, including expanded market access and pilot programmes to encourage investment in science and technology.\n\nOn Sunday, Li said China's previously announced $140-billion plan to issue ultra-long bonds would create a fund to spur investment and stabilise growth.\n\nOther officials highlighted Xi's commitment to drive investment in \"new productive forces,\" industries that officials have said includes networked electric vehicles, spaceflight and cutting-edge drug development.

        "title": "Analysis-Google, Apple breakups on the agenda as global regulators target tech",
        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee\n\nBRUSSELS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Big Tech is facing its biggest challenge in decades as antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic crack down on alleged anti-competitive practices that could result in break-up orders to Apple and Alphabet's Google, a first for the industry.\n\nThat in turn could inspire watchdogs around the world to pile on, as evidenced in the growing number of antitrust probes in various countries following the opening of EU and U.S. cases. Since AT&T was broken up exactly 40 years ago, no company has faced the possibility of a regulator-led break-up in the United States until now.\n\nGoogle has said it disagreed with the EU's accusations while Apple said the U.S. lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn 1984, AT&T, also known as Ma Bell, was broken up into seven independent companies called \"Baby Bells\" to open up one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century. AT&T, Verizon and Lumen are currently the only surviving entities.\n\nRegulators now allege companies such as Apple and Google have built impenetrable ecosystems around their products, making it difficult for customers to switch to rival services, which led to the coining of the term walled gardens.\n\nThe U.S Department of Justice on Wednesday warned Apple, a $2.7 trillion company, that a break-up order is not excluded as a remedy to restore competition after it teamed up with 15 states to sue the iPhone maker for monopolising the smartphone market, thwarting rivals and inflating prices.\n\nEven so, it will likely take years to decide the case, which Apple has vowed to fight.\n\nThe U.S. actions come on the heels of other mounting threats across Europe this week.\n\nBig Tech will face more scrutiny shortly with Apple, Meta Platforms and Alphabet likely to be investigated for potential Digital Markets Act (DMA) violations that could lead to hefty fines and even break-up orders for repeated breaches, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStory continues\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager helped pave the way for drastic measures last year when she accused Google of anti-competitive practices in its money-spinning adtech business and that it may have to divest its sell-side tools.\n\nShe said that requiring Google to sell some of its assets seemed to be the only way to avoid conflicts of interest as it would prevent Google from allegedly favouring its own online digital advertising technology services versus advertisers and online publishers.\n\nVestager is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year.\n\nEuropean Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who was heavily involved in drafting landmark EU DMA tech rules that kicked in this month, said lawmakers want bold action against Big Tech which flouts rules.\n\n\"If they don't comply with the DMA, you can imagine what Parliament will ask for. Break-ups. The ultimate goal is to make markets open, fair and allow more innovation,\" he said on Friday.\n\nBREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO\n\nIt is far from certain that regulators will issue break-up order as they mull options and any action may just result in a fine. Legal experts also suggested the case against Apple, drawing from the 1998 case against Microsoft, could be more difficult this time.\n\n\"In the European Union, there is less of a tradition, with splitting a company seen as a last resort. It has never happened before,\" said a Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nApple's highly integrated system would also make a break-up difficult compared with Google, said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.\n\n\"It seems to me much more complicated. You are talking about something that is integrated, for example you can't force Apple to divest its App Store. That doesn't make sense,\" he said.\n\nHe said it would be better to impose behavioural remedies on Apple that obligates it to do certain things while in the case of Google, a break-up order could simply target acquisitions made to strengthen its key services.\n\n\"What's more likely is they (DOJ) go for remedies like opening up hardware functionality, or making sure developers aren't being discriminated against in terms of pricing,\" said Max von Thun, director of advocacy group Open Markets.\n\n\"I think they want to say that everything's on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll choose that path,\" he said.\n\nApple gets most of its nearly $400 billion-a-year revenue from selling hardware -- iPhones, Macs, iPads and Watches -- followed by its Services business, which will brings in roughly $100 billion a year.\n\nStructural remedies such as break-ups will ultimately be tested in courts, said Assimakis Komninos, partner at law firm White & Case.\n\n\"I would say that experiences of imposed structural measures, such as breakups, are not many, but the small past experience shows that this is very tricky, aside from the formidable legal challenges,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, additional reporting by Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Ken Li and Anna Driver)",

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway's Beating the Market, But Its Biggest Holdings Aren't. What Gives?",
        "content": "Over the course of the past few years, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has measurably outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). That's not exactly news, of course. The Oracle of Omaha's stock picks have beaten the broad market in most years since the company was taken over by Buffett back in 1965. Buffett's value-oriented regimen works!\n\nFor the past couple of years, however, something curious has happened. Berkshire stock is still beating the market. But the company's very biggest holdings, like Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), American Express(NYSE: AXP), and Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), are at best merely keeping up with the S&P 500, or at worst severely lagging it.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nDividends explain part of the difference -- but only a small part. The dividends Berkshire's collected from the stocks it's holding still don't come close to fully explaining why the fund is doing so well when the stocks it's holding aren't. The remainder of the difference is rooted in something else well worth understanding, since it has implications for all investors, particularly for investors that like to borrow the occasional stock pick from Buffett.\n\nSomething doesn't add up for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nAnyone reading this likely already knows that while Berkshire holds about four dozen different stocks, it's not a particularly well-diversified fund. Its three biggest positions account for around 60% of Berkshire's entire stock portfolio. The next biggest three -- Coca-Cola, Chevron(NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) -- make up another 16% of the fund's picks. Just for good measure, we'll point out that Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) is its seventh-biggest position. At a mere 3% of the value of all of Berkshire Hathaway's stocks, however, it's far from being a high-impact holding. All told, these seven stocks account for more than 80% of the total value of the fund's positions in publicly traded companies. If Berkshire Hathaway is going to rise or fall, it's seemingly going to happen because of these tickers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd yet for the past one-year and two-year timeframes, six out of seven of these tickers have underperformed the S&P 500, while Berkshire shares have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\n% of Portfolio 4-Year Chg. 3-Year Chg. 2-Year Chg. 1-Year Chg. Berkshire Hathaway 137% 62% 18% 36% S&P 500 114% 32% 15% 31% Apple 43% 188% 47% 4% 12% Bank of America 10% 70% (6%) (18%) 30% American Express 9% 187% 57% 16% 36% Coca-Cola 7% 44% 18% (1%) 0% Chevron 5% 173% 51% (4%) 0% Occidental Petroleum 4% 489% 127% 7% 9% Kraft Heinz 3% 58% (10%) (7%) (6%)\n\nData source: TradeStation\n\nHow is this possible? If it's not coming from Berkshire's biggest stock positions, where's all of this value coming from?\n\nIt's an often-forgotten detail about Berkshire Hathaway, but it's not a mutual fund. It's a conglomerate that just so happens to use much of its idle cash to hold stocks of publicly traded companies. The conglomerate itself owns over 60 privately held companies, including familiar ones like GEICO Auto Insurance, Pilot Travel Centers, railroad company BNSF, Dairy Queen, Duracell, flooring company Shaw, and Clayton Homes, just to name a few. These are sound businesses as well. And arguably far more so than Berkshire's individual stock holdings, these privately owned businesses are geared first and foremost to generate cash for the parent company. Depending on the year, all of Berkshire's holdings combined generate between $40 billion and $50 billion worth of operating cash flow per year.\n\nTo put this figure in perspective, Berkshire Hathaway's current market cap stands around $900 billion, less than half of which is made up of the sum value of all the stocks it holds. These stocks couldn't even come close to producing the bulk of this operating cash flow. Most of Berkshire's cash generation (which carried it to a record hoard of $167.6 billion as of the end of last year) comes from its privately held businesses.\n\nHow to be like Buffett when he's not buying new stocks\n\nThe problem for investors is obvious: Outside of owning a stake in Berkshire, you can't invest in any of Berkshire Hathaway's privately owned entities like Duracell batteries, GEICO, or See's Candies -- they're not publicly traded. For investors who wholeheartedly believe in doing things exactly the way Warren Buffett does them, this presents a clear challenge.\n\nThere are some similar alternatives, however, for investors willing to venture off the beaten path.\n\nYou've likely heard the term \"private equity,\" perhaps without fully knowing what it means. It's not complicated. Just as the name suggests, private equity firms supply promising up-and-coming companies with capital, usually in the form of a loan, but sometimes in exchange for an equity stake in a company. Ordinary investors can't make such deals. But ordinary investors can buy shares of private equity firms, plugging into the premise of owning budding businesses that aren't publicly traded.\n\nBlackstone(NYSE: BX) is one of these private equity firms, and it's a good one. Share prices are up nearly 50% for the past year, and higher to the tune of 250% for the past five.\n\nDriving these gains is its underlying portfolio of client/customer companies. It's currently funding 126 different outfits, including Ancestry.com, Emerson Climate Technologies, dating app Bumble, and Hello Sunshine (a media business launched by actress Reese Witherspoon). None of these are companies you can directly invest in on your own.\n\nPublicly traded private equity firms aren't your only means of plugging into otherwise-uninvestable companies, however. A category of organizations called business development companies (or BDCs) can do the job too. Take Prospect Capital(NASDAQ: PSEC) as an example. In many ways, it functions like a private equity firm by virtue of providing capital to mid-sized companies that may not qualify for conventional loans but also aren't ready to go public just yet. All told, Prospect is working with over 100 different companies including Shutterfly, Staples, Credit.com, and playground equipment maker PlayPower.\n\nThe key difference between Prospect and Blackstone is that Prospect Capital is mostly built from the ground up to generate dividend income from its loans rather than drive capital appreciation. Prospect is currently yielding an impressive 13.2%.\n\nTake the hint from Berkshire\n\nBlackstone and Prospect Capital obviously aren't the only private equity (or business development company) outfits out there. Indeed, there may be far more of these private investment and BDC options to choose from than you ever might have imagined. And they're all increasingly worth a look, particularly given how the overall stock market continues to inch toward uncomfortably high valuations. As was noted, not even Buffett is nibbling here, and he's never been one to shy away from a worthy investment just because he might have to pay a bit of a premium for it. Maybe you shouldn't be nibbling on conventional stocks either.\n\nPrivate companies, however, are a compelling alternative to ordinary stocks. And not just right now. If the market's current volatility and persistently rich valuations become the new norm, perhaps more investors should be taking bigger, more serious looks at these truly alternative ways of putting your money to work.\n\nThis might help drive the point home: Capital markets data company Preqin suggests the current private credit market is worth on the order of $1.5 trillion right now, but by 2027 could be worth $2.2 trillion. In a similar vein, market research outfit Technavio predicts the worldwide private equity market will be about 50% bigger in 2027 than it is now.\n\nTo this end, maybe Buffett is onto something, recognizing that conventional stocks just aren't promising enough given their current prices. He seems to be pretty content with -- and doing pretty well with -- Berkshire's privately owned businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "43.5% of Warren Buffett's $372 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the best investors in history. Since 1965, he has steered the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company to a mind-boggling 4,384,748% increase in value. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up just 31,223% over the same period.\n\nBuffett's investing strategy is simple. He likes companies with steady growth, strong profitability, and high-performing management teams. He's especially fond of those that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. That strict criteria is why so few technology stocks have made their way into Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nA group of companies dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have captivated investors over the past year with their strong performance and whopping $13.5 trillion in combined valuation. The seven stocks include:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia  Microsoft  Alphabet (parent company of Google) Meta Platforms Tesla\n\nBerkshire owns just two of the above names, but they account for 43.5% of the conglomerate's $372 billion publicly traded stocks and securities portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire's portfolio\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, but it also dominates the cloud computing industry with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, and it has a fast-growing presence in both streaming and digital advertising. Berkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, and while it only accounts for a small fraction of the conglomerate's portfolio, Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying more.\n\nInvestors are firmly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) right now, and Amazon is quickly becoming a leader in that field, too. As the largest cloud platform, AWS is well-positioned to distribute every layer of AI to thousands of businesses worldwide.\n\nAmazon developed its own data center chips called Trainium and Inferentia, which help set its AI infrastructure apart from many other operators who rely solely on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company also created its own large language models (LLMs) under its Titan program, which developers can use to build their own AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, AWS offers businesses some ready-made AI applications. They include CodeWhisperer, which helps programmers write code more quickly, and Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered virtual assistant. Businesses can feed their data into Q, at which point it can answer complex questions, create content, and help employees solve problems.\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023. That was more than Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla combined during their equivalent reporting periods. Yet, on a price-to-sales basis, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than all three of them. AMZN Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nAmazon is a huge organization, so why have I focused mostly on AI? While e-commerce created most of the company's value in the early days -- and still accounts for 41% of its total revenue -- AI will likely help Amazon close that valuation gap in the future thanks to the substantial growth it could deliver.\n\nBuffett might regret not owning more Amazon stock, but Berkshire's position is worth $1.7 billion, which is still a nice chunk of change.\n\n2. Apple: 43% of Berkshire's portfolio\n\nApple produces some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, from the iPhone to the Mac computer. Berkshire started buying Apple stock in 2016, and it has spent approximately $38 billion building its position since then. That's more money than the conglomerate has invested in any other stock except one.\n\nThanks to Apple's strong growth, Berkshire's position is now worth a whopping $160.2 billion, representing 43% of its $372 billion portfolio.\n\nThe iPhone is Apple's most successful product. It accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue, and it led to multibillion-dollar offshoot products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, with more than 2.2 billion iPhones currently active around the world, Apple is struggling to generate growth. The company's total revenue actually shrank during fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), and it grew by a modest 2.1% year over year in the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30).\n\nApple's services segment remains a bright spot, though. It includes subscription-based platforms like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV, in addition to other services like Apple Pay. The services segment generated 11.3% in revenue growth during Q1, offsetting the flat hardware sales.\n\nLike Amazon, Apple is turning to AI to unlock its next growth phase. The latest iPhone 15 Pro is fitted with the A17 Pro chip, which is capable of efficiently processing AI workloads on-device. To utilize that computing power, Apple is developing its own LLMs and AI applications in-house, but it's reportedly in talks with leading developers like OpenAI and Alphabet, too.\n\nAdvanced AI will make existing features like the Siri voice assistant far more competent and streamline tasks like writing messages and emails. Plus, a virtual chatbot might reduce the amount of time users spend trawling the internet for information.\n\nGiven the iPhone's enormous installed base, whichever AI platform Apple chooses could instantly become the most widely adopted in the world. I would expect a company like Alphabet to pay billions of dollars to have Apple use its Gemini AI model, the same way it pays Apple to set Google as the default search engine on the iPhone.\n\nBuffett might have to be patient for AI to reignite Apple's growth. However, considering the company paid $3.8 billion in dividends to shareholders and spent $20.1 billion on stock buybacks in the recent quarter alone, he is being paid handsomely while he waits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds more details from ministry statements)\n\nSHANGHAI, March 23 (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has met top executives of global companies including Apple Inc and SK Hynix Inc ahead of a major business conference as Beijing woos foreign investors amid geopolitical and trade tensions.\n\nIn the meetings with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and other global chiefs on Friday and Saturday, Wang said China was committed to opening up its economy and offered growth opportunities for multinationals, according to ministry statements.\n\nThe meetings took place ahead of the China Development Forum, which will be held in Beijing on Sunday and Monday. It is a high-level annual event where foreign business leaders can interact with senior Chinese government officials.\n\nChina, grappling with a slowing economy, is stepping up efforts to attract foreign companies amid heightened Sino-U.S. tensions and Western \"de-risking\" efforts to diversify supply chains away from China.\n\nForeign investment flows into China shrank nearly 20% in the January-February period from a year earlier, commerce ministry data showed on Friday.\n\nCook opened Apple's newest store in Shanghai on Thursday, as the phone maker battles falling iPhone sales in China and rising competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei. The smartphone maker is now facing a major antitrust action in the United States.\n\nWang told Cook that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is a stabilising force for bilateral relations and that China was willing to work with the United States to create a \"fair, stable and predictable environment\" for businesses, the ministry said.\n\nIn a separate meeting, Wang and CEO Kwak of semiconductor maker Hynix discussed supply chain cooperation between China and South Korea, the ministry said.\n\nWang said he hoped that Hynix can continue to invest in China, and share growth opportunities from the country's huge electronics consumer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. government has been pressing its allies including South Korea, the Netherlands and Japan to curb China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nIn a meeting with BNP Paribas chairman Jean Lemierre, Wang said China hoped to resolve Sino-Europe trade disputes through dialogue and cooperation, and that the French lender could play an active role in the process.\n\nTrade disputes between China and Europe have been mounting over the past year. The European Union has launched an investigation into Chinese electric vehicle imports over state subsidies, while China has opened an anti-dumping investigation on brandy imported from the EU.\n\nWang also held a roundtable on Saturday with executives of global drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb, GSK and Pfizer, the ministry said.

        "title": "Broadening US market rally gets boost from dovish Fed",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A reassuring economic outlook and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve are encouraging investors to look beyond the massive growth and technology stocks that have fueled the U.S. stock market’s gains over the past year.\n\nThough rallies in stocks such as Nvidia and Meta Platforms have been the market’s main individual drivers in 2024, the financials, industrials and energy sectors are also outperforming the S&P 500’s 9.7% year-to-date gain. That has eased worries that the market was becoming increasingly tied to the fortunes of a small group of stocks.\n\nA belief that the economy will remain resilient while inflation fades has prompted investors to look for winners outside of the megacaps. That view received a boost from the Fed earlier this week, when the central bank expressed confidence it would be able to tamp down inflation and cut interest rates this year, even as it raised its forecast for how much the U.S. economy will grow.\n\n“There is more confidence that the Fed is going to be able to ... get inflation approaching their longer-term targets without a recession,\" said Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, which is overweight the technology, financial and industrial sectors. “You are going to take a little bit more comfort that you can own a bank or an industrial if you think the Fed is going to lower rates at some point here.”\n\nInvestors in the coming week will be watching Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index that will offer the latest read on inflation. The end of the first quarter also could prompt volatility as fund managers adjust their portfolios.\n\nThe broadening rally contrasts with last year, when uncertainty over the economic outlook prompted investors to seek shelter in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, drawn by their dominant industry positions and strong balance sheets. Only the sectors that housed megacaps - tech, communication services and consumer discretionary - outperformed the S&P 500’s 24% gain last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis year, the financial and industrial sectors are up 10.1% and 9.9%, respectively, while energy has gained 10.3%.\n\nMore broadly, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com - have been responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s gain as of Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year.\n\nThe wider rally \"means that leadership isn't so concentrated and susceptible to a correction,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.\n\nAfter the Magnificent Seven all posted huge gains in 2023, performance among them has diverged more this year, giving investors another reason to look at the rest of the market.\n\nEnthusiasm over artificial intelligence has helped fuel a 90% gain in shares of Nvidia so far this year, while Microsoft has gained 14.5%. On the other side of the ledger, Apple and Tesla are down about 11% and 32%, respectively, for the year.\n\nThe latest blow for Apple came this week when the Department of Justice alleged the iPhone maker monopolized the smartphone market, highlighting the regulatory risks that could make investors wary of Big Tech.\n\nIn another sign of broadening, more S&P 500 stocks are outperforming the benchmark, 180 so far this year as of Thursday versus 150 last year.\n\nSome corners of the market, such as small caps, still look subdued. The Russell 2000, which is focused on smaller companies, is up just 2.2% year-to-date.\n\nSome investors believe the group could get a boost from the Fed’s outlook, which kept in place a previous forecast of three 25 basis-point interest rate cuts, despite the central bank’s upgraded growth projections.\n\n\"As the Fed starts to lower interest rates, that creates liquidity and makes financing easier,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. \"Who's most advantaged? Not the megacap stocks that have unfettered access to capital no matter what rates are, but really the smaller, lesser-known names.\"\n\nThe broadening trend could take a hit if the economy begins floundering or runs too hot, upsetting the so-called Goldilocks narrative that has supported markets in recent months.\n\nSome investors also believe the market is due for a pullback after a run in which the S&P 500 has gained 27% since late October.\n\nOthers, however, are betting the trend will continue. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said his firm recently purchased shares of Goldman Sachs and oil services company Tidewater while reducing its megacap holdings, including selling its Apple stake.\n\n\"The market is broadening out,\" he said. \"You're just seeing that there's more ways to make money this year than the Mag 7.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",

Larger firms will benefit from exemptions for personal data collected for human resources purposes or classified as “non-sensitive,” under rules effective immediately, the Cyberspace Administration of China said.\n\nThe relaxation comes as China tries to reverse a decline in foreign investment. The statement was released on the eve of a high-profile business forum in Beijing, where attendance is expected by chief executives from foreign corporations including Apple Inc., Pfizer Inc. and FedEx Corp.\n\n“The relaxations are meaningful. This is the government’s response to foreign companies’ complaints,” said Tom Nunlist, an analyst at consultancy Trivium.\n\nFinance, Drugs\n\nThe new rules were largely in line with a draft released last year, which stated that what counts as “important” data must be specified by regulators and can otherwise be treated as non important. In theory, that will reduce uncertainty about what kinds of data can be transferred freely.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The draft promised to make compliance easier, and these regulations deliver on that. For cross-border transfers for everyday business activities, it’s business-as-usual now,” Nunlist said.\n\nWhile most regulatory burdens on small and medium-sized companies firms will be removed, large multinationals in finance, pharmaceuticals and automobile manufacturing could still face difficulties with data transfers, Nunlist added.\n\nBeijing’s rules on data transfers, introduced in 2021, were widely seen to be more onerous than even the European Union’s strict data protection regime. International firms, from hoteliers to banks, were faced with slow approvals to transmit data beyond China’s mainland. Companies worried that mundane transfers, such as providing overseas headquarters with updates on new hires, could fall afoul of Beijing’s rules.\n\nEuropean Lobbying\n\nForeign business lobby groups have been urging Beijing to relax the rules, and EU and Chinese leaders discussed them at a summit in December.\n\nOrganizations dealing with “critical infrastructure” or handling personal data of more than 1 million people still will need to pass security assessments in order to transfer data, the regulator said.\n\nStill, “far fewer organizations will need to apply for export security reviews,” said Rogier Creemers, a researcher on Chinese internet regulation at Leiden University in the Netherlands. This is particularly important for sectors such as aviation and e-commerce, he said.\n\nSome ambiguities remain, according to analysts. The government has yet to fully specify what it considers as “important data” or which organizations could be counted as part of “critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe new rules include carve-out for “free trade zones” within China to enforce more relaxed data transfer standards. That could allow local governments to provide more room for companies whose data is classified as important, analysts said.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with details, analysts’ comments.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. has filed a lawsuit against Apple with the aim of increasing competition for the iPhone and giving a leg up to smaller companies whose apps work with the ubiquitous device.\n\nIn the lawsuit against the $2.7 trillion company, the U.S. argues the iPhone maker hurt smaller rivals and drove up prices, and the Justice Department is asking the court \"to restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by Apple's unlawful conduct\".\n\nApple said the lawsuit threatens the company and the principles that set its products apart in a competitive market.\n\nIn Europe, consumers have already benefited after a slew of rules and regulations compelled Apple to make a number of user-friendly changes to its popular smartphone, suggesting similar changes could occur in the U.S. if the Justice Department lawsuit is successful.\n\nBelow are several areas where EU competition authorities have changed the rules and Apple has altered its product.\n\nCHARGING CABLES\n\nApple's switch to USB-C chargers – the standard for Android-based devices – may be the most obvious change for users.\n\nIn 2022, the EU passed a law making the charging port the compulsory standard across the 27-nation bloc by the end of 2024. This made it easier for consumers to power up their devices using chargers they already owned, or to borrow those belonging to others.\n\nAPP STORE\n\nIn Europe, new rules have created alternatives to Apple’s App Store, meaning users can download applications from rival sources, including websites and rival app stores.\n\nThis allows developers to avoid the tech giant's 30% commission fee which, in theory, could mean apps becoming cheaper. Once fully implemented, users should also enjoy access to a wider range of apps.\n\nPAYMENTS USING NON-APPLE WEBSITES\n\nIn both the EU and the U.S., app developers can direct users to their own websites to buy items, rather than having to use Apple’s in-app purchasing system, which also takes a 30% cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe change was made in the EU in line with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act. In the U.S., Apple’s hand was forced following a lawsuit from Fortnite-maker Epic Games, a longstanding critic of the tech giant’s business practices.\n\nBROWSERS\n\nAnother change in Europe introduced to comply with the EU digital markets law concerns default web browsers. Safari has been the default browser on iPhones since the device was first released in 2007.\n\nWhile iPhone users could already change their default to a competitor like Google Chrome or Opera, they will now be automatically be given the choice to switch when opening Safari in the latest Apple software update, iOS 17.4.\n\nPushing back against the EU changes, Apple said users would be presented with a list of options without the chance to learn about them, and warned it would interrupt their browsing experience.\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter in London and Chris Sanders in Washington, editing by Deepa Babington)",

        "title": "Apple Scraps Plan to Design Display for Watch In-House, Cuts Jobs",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is winding down a long-running project to design and develop its own smartwatch displays, putting an end to another pricey research and development initiative.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond China Scrutinizes PwC Role in $78 Billion Evergrande Fraud Case Yemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be Targeted\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has ceased an in-house effort to create screens with microLED technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The displays, which featured brighter and more vibrant visuals, would have been added to a future version of the Apple Watch — before potentially going into other products.\n\nBut the cost and complexity of the effort ultimately proved too great. So Apple is now reorganizing the teams that handle display engineering and eliminating several dozen roles in the US and Asia, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nThe move to shutter the project came around the same time as the company’s decision to cancel work on a self-driving car. In both cases, Apple is giving at least some affected employees the opportunity to find other roles within the company. If they can’t get new jobs — a likely scenario for some of them — the workers will be laid off and provided severance. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe display project was part of a broader push by Apple to design more of its technology in-house. Though the company already customizes the displays in its products, they are heavily based on designs from partners like LG Display Co. and Samsung SDI Co. By bringing more of that process inside Apple, the company hoped to gain an edge over competitors.\n\nIt also saw promise in microLED, which is made from millions of microscopic light-emitting diodes, and wanted to take a key role in developing it. The technology uses less power, reproduces colors more accurately and allows for thinner devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe effort kicked off about seven years ago within Apple’s hardware engineering organization. It was later shifted to Wei Chen, who runs Apple’s display group. The project — codenamed T159 — was relocated to Apple’s hardware technologies division a few years ago.\n\nApple even built its own screen manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, California, near its Cupertino headquarters, where hundreds of employees could test the production of microLED screens. Many of the job cuts involve people at that site — along with Apple display engineering centers in Asia near the company’s supply-chain hubs.\n\nRead More: Apple Is Developing Gadget Displays in Secret Facility\n\nA visit to the Santa Clara facility this week showed that the building was still operational, with cars in the parking lot and a small number of employees entering and exiting the building.\n\nWhen Apple hatched the microLED plan years ago, it saw the technology as a successor to the current standard: organic LED screens, or OLEDs. It expected to eventually push microLEDs into all of its products, from Apple Watches to iPhones to Macs.\n\nIn 2018, the company believed it was capable of bringing the screens to the Apple Watch as early as 2020. That timeline ended up getting delayed until 2024, and then 2025 and beyond. The situation was similar to Apple’s work on the electric car, whose release was postponed several times.\n\nFor all their benefits, microLED screens were difficult to produce in sufficient quantities. Manufacturing them required cutting-edge technology and a complicated process called LED transfers — the placing of pixels in the display. Though Apple owned the design and manufacturing process for the microLED screens, it enlisted a number of partners to handle mass production and tasks like LED transfers.\n\nNews of a shift in the project first emerged in recent weeks, when suppliers announced that they were losing microLED-related contracts. That included AMS-Osram AG, which said the cancellation would force it to cut jobs, potentially sell a manufacturing plant and record a writedown that could approach $1 billion.\n\nFor now, Apple believes that OLED is the best current solution for its smartwatch. But it’s still eyeing microLED for other projects down the road, the people said. The company is identifying potential new suppliers and processes that could make the technology a reality in its devices, though that won’t likely happen anytime soon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Apple's Days of Smartphone Monopoly Are Coming To An End",
        "content": "On Thursday, U.S. the US Justice Department, along with 17 states and districts, filed a blockbuster lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple has been accused of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market by violating federal antitrust law to stay ahead of its rivals. As a reminder, Apple ended 2023 by dethroning Samsung as the world’s biggest smartphone seller. Samsung led for 12 years, but Apple got the crown after releasing its iPhone 15 in the fall. Apple is well established as the largest smartphone maker in terms of revenue and profits, but this was the first time it led in terms of volume. The success of Huawei in China also contributed to the fall of Samsung, with the Android market being divided between Xiaomi, Google and Honor.\n\nHow did Apple illegal monopolize the smartphone market?\n\nThe Thursday’s lawsuit suggests that Apple used a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. It has used its control over the iPhone operation system iOS to keep innovative apps and cloud streaming services away, as well as to degrade the quality of Google-developed Android messages that are received on iPhones, along with restricting how competing smartwatches work with the iPhone and even forbid the offering of rival payment solutions.\n\nIn simple words, Apple has been accused of making barriers that make it difficult to venture out outside its ecosystem.\n\nThe largest antitrust complaint in a recent wave against Big Tech.\n\nRegulators are doing their best to crack the power Big Tech has been enjoying for quite a while as over the past few decades, its actions were largely unchecked. First, the European regulators kicked off the new year by forcing Apple to give other companies in the EU access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip which enables the creation of digital wallets other than Apple Pay.\n\nNow, the Justice Department is asking the court to forbid Apple to block innovative apps in its store. Also, it demands the court to make Apple remove the restrictions it imposed to prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other applications from integrating smoothly with the iPhone, just like Apple’s apps. It also asked demanded the court to disable Apple from using contractual terms to protect the monopoly it established.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple finds the lawsuit unfair, stating that it compromises its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology with which it became one the world’s most valuable companies. Like its Big Tech peers, Apple has been shrugging off legal criticism for years. But this year’s suits from EU and US regulators challenge its very ID. Regulators are determined in making Big Tech accountable for its actions and ongoing antitrust cases against Apple and Google show things are getting more serious. What is certain is that long gone are the days of Steve Jobs’ era when Apple was a cultural phenomenon due to its relentless pursuit of earth-shattering innovation. Now, Apple is no longer several steps ahead of its rivals and instead of innovating, it is milking Jobs’ legacy while fighting for market share with its CEO focused on financial management. For now, it is financially healthy, but it is a lot more vulnerable than it used to be, with regulators and Chinese rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, biting off its power and dominance. Even Huawei is a competitive threat to Apple at the world's largest smartphone market, China. Meanwhile, Samsung is releasing models with AI features while Apple is lagging its rivals in that race, promising to add AI features this year with Bloomberg having recently reported that it is in talks with Google to power its new iPhone with the Gemini generative AI model.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Apple Shares Wobble as Antitrust Suit Takes Aim at Growth Pillar",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For years, Apple Inc. investors have consoled themselves with the idea that no matter what trends look like for major product categories, growth in services would remain robust. Now, the outlook for that business is on shakier footing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Yemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be Targeted China Scrutinizes PwC Role in $78 Billion Evergrande Fraud Case What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond\n\nIts shares fell the most since August on Thursday, after the Justice Department filed a suit accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws and suppressing competition by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.\n\nThe decline also brings Apple’s year-to-date slide near 11%, erasing $337 billion from its market capitalization. The selloff stands in contrast to the rest of big tech, with the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index up about 17% this year. Apple was little changed on Friday.\n\nRead more: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake\n\n“Services has been the driver of growth for Apple, with huge margins, and there’s a question of where the business goes from here,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “I hope they can limit the damage as much as possible, because we don’t see any new growth drivers on the horizon and the stock still looks expensive. It could be dead money for a while.”\n\nThe suit brought by the US Justice Department on Thursday adds a level of risk to Apple’s services business — home to the App Store and Apple Music — that is fed by the more than two billion Apple devices in use. Services revenue expanded 9% in fiscal 2023 while products revenue — iPhones, Macs and iPads — dropped 3%. Furthermore, despite only accounting for 22% of Apple’s sales, services generated more than a third of profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe App Store is the biggest component of Apple’s services business. Analysts expect it to generate about $5.8 billion in second-quarter revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total revenue is expected to be $90.5 billion.\n\nRegulatory issues are just the latest headache for investors, who are also grappling with weak sales in China, concerns that Apple is behind peers with artificial intelligence, and few obvious catalysts for growth. Bloomberg News recently reported that Apple canceled a long-term effort to build an electric car, and its Vision Pro headset isn’t expected to be a major contributor to revenue in the near-term.\n\nApple’s second-quarter results, scheduled for release in May, are expected to show revenue down 4.5%. That would represent the fifth quarter with negative growth of the past six. The consensus for Apple’s full-year revenue has dropped 2.1% over the past quarter.\n\nEven after recent declines, the shares trade at 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average, though a slight discount to the 26 multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\n“Shares already look expensive, and if we start to see a deterioration in important high-margin businesses like services and the App Store, then it will look even more expensive,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors. He sees an “air pocket” for the stock until it nears $155. It last closed at $171.37.\n\nThis has become an increasingly common view on Apple — a notable deterioration in sentiment for what was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, compared with rates above 85% for Microsoft Corp, Nvidia Corp, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nTo be sure, the antitrust suit is expected to play out over a long period of time with potential appeals. That would limit near-term impact for a company seen to have a rock-solid balance sheet and massive cash flow. But for some investors, the stock’s recent performance is alarming.\n\n“There’s still a lot of value in the brand, but it is underperforming, has weak growth, a lot of headline risk, and it’s not even cheap,” said Clark. “Honestly, why hold it?”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAmazon.com Inc. shares are trading near the highest level since 2021 and inching closer toward an all time high. The stock is the third-best performer this year among the Magnificent Seven group of tech companies, as investors focus on Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting drive that is reshaping the once free-spending company.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nChinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. “potentially” broke American law if it manufactured a processor for sanctioned telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., a senior US official said. Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay Inflection AI $650 million, largely to license its artificial intelligence software, alongside its move earlier this week to hire much of the startup’s staff, according to a person familiar with the transaction. A surprise endorsement from Nvidia Corp. may have excited some investors over the prospects for Samsung Electronics Co. to catch up in the artificial intelligence race, but others remain unconvinced. Tesla Inc. has reduced electric car production at its plant in China, according to people familiar with the matter, amid sluggish growth in new-energy vehicle sales and intense competition in the world’s biggest automobile market. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. sold almost $360 million of stock in Chinese streaming platform Bilibili Inc. at a significant discount, the latest in a string of asset deals from an e-commerce pioneer seeking capital to invest in AI and rejuvenate the business.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Tech stocks are known more for their significant long-term growth than for their dividends. However, investing in a tech company with a reliable dividend can be an excellent way to expand your portfolio, benefiting from a high-growth industry and potential dividend reinvestment.\n\nFive of the six most valuable companies in the world are tech firms. The industry generates massive amounts of cash, allowing some larger firms to reward investors with more than just stock growth.\n\nWhile these companies' dividend yields might not compare to some non-tech stocks, they are worth considering along with their stellar share-price appreciation. So here are three dividend-paying tech stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for AI developers worldwide. The company became the first chipmaker to hit a market cap above $1 trillion, with its stock rising 249% in the last year.\n\nThe company paid its first dividend in 2013 and increased it every year until November 2018. Its dividend remained at $0.16 until May 2021. A 4-for-1 stock split the same year brought its quarterly dividend proportionally down to $0.04 per share for a 0.02% yield, where it currently stands.\n\nHowever, it remains an attractive dividend-paying tech stock. When companies like Amazon and Alphabet have no dividends, Nvidia's impressive stock growth, alongside even a small dividend, makes its stock worth buying.\n\nNvidia's quarterly revenue climbed 207% over the last year, while operating income has soared 536%. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that will likely see it raise its dividend in the coming years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nMoreover, this chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,294, projecting stock growth of 44% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with a reliable dividend, Nvidia's stock looks like a no-brainer investment right now.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, which translates to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).\n\nConsistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model. Potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox made the company a tech behemoth.\n\nThe success of these products has seen Microsoft's annual revenue rise 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion last year.\n\nAlong with solid financials, there are plenty of reasons to believe Microsoft will continue increasing its dividend. It pays out only about 25% of its earnings in dividends, indicating it could keep growing its dividend even if headwinds arise.\n\nMoreover, the company is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term.\n\nA forward P/E ratio of 36 makes its stock somewhat expensive. However, a dominating role in tech and consistent dividend growth means its stock has likely earned its high valuation and is worth considering right now.\n\n3. Apple\n\nRather than focusing exclusively on high yields, one of the best ways to find dividend stocks is to seek out companies with significant cash resources, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). A focus on high yields could lead you to an investment in a financially struggling business; meanwhile, a cash cow like Apple can almost guarantee dividend growth over the long term.\n\nIn the last decade, its dividend yield has increased 104%. It rose to $0.24 per quarter in 2023, with a yield of 0.5%. Apple has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years, with its payout requiring only about 15% of its earnings.\n\nApple's yield might not be as impressive as popular dividend stocks like Verizon or Coca-Cola, but sticking with its current dividend growth trajectory could see the payouts double again over the next 10 years. With a stock that has risen 840% since 2014, the company could be one of the smartest long-term investments.\n\nAnd it's hard to argue with Apple's powerful position in tech. The company hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year thanks to the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and iPad, as well as its many digital services.\n\nThe company's forward P/E of 27 makes it slightly cheaper than Microsoft but still pricey. However, a reliable dividend and expansions into lucrative markets like AI and virtual reality make its stock a solid buy this March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Apple antitrust suit mirrors strategy that beat Microsoft, but tech industry has changed",
        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition.\n\nThe market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said.\n\nThe Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.\n\nApple said the government is wrong on the facts and law.\n\nThe government has to prove that Apple’s business practices were “exclusionary” and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts.\n\nThe government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called \"super apps,\" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.\n\nOne example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone — the dreaded \"green bubble\" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system.\n\nAntitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services.\n\nBy comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company’s operating system.\n\nThat might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple can contract with whom it want and to design products as it sees fit, legal experts said.\n\nIt becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington’s law school.\n\n“The fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,\" Ross said. \"That has antitrust law backwards.\"\n\nMARKET SHARE\n\nMicrosoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google's Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm.\n\nThe Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market.\n\nApple and rival Samsung Electronics each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed.\n\nMicrosoft \"clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,\" Ross said. On the other hand, Android “is very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.”\n\nRoss predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case.\n\nSome of these allegations have been touched upon before in court.\n\nIn 2021, in an antitrust case brought by \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were \"locked-in\" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices.\n\nOf course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case.\n\nLegal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases.\n\n“They are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,” said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple.\n\nLitigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market.\n\n\"If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,\" Maxman said. \"That's exactly what was said in Microsoft — and guess what, it was true.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Tom Hals and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "Reddit shares soar on first day of public trading. (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nReddit (RDDT)\n\nShares in Reddit soared 48% on their market debut after an initial public offering, valuing the social media platform at more than $9bn (£7.14bn).\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) for the San Francisco-based company was first priced at $34 a share, putting its market value at $6.4bn.\n\nHowever, in the first 24 hours of trading, the stock peaked at $57.80 a share, up 70%, before dropping to $50.44 to close the day.\n\nWithin the IPO, Reddit reserved 1.7 million shares for the site's users, friends and family.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as rain dampens UK high street retail sales\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA life-size version of Reddit’s alien mascot Snoo rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, to cheers and applause.\n\nApple (APPL)\n\nThe US has filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolising the smartphone market.\n\nThe Department of Justice accused the company of using its control over the device to unfairly control the market for smartphones, taking illegal steps to thwart apps seen as a threat and make rival products less appealing.\n\n\"Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal anti-trust law,\" attorney general Merrick Garland said at a press conference announcing the suit.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"Customers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law.\"\n\nApple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea.\n\nShares of the company slid 4.1% on Thursday, erasing about $113bn in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back to 11%, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWetherspoons (JDW.L)\n\nPub chain JD Wetherspoon revealed profits rocketed last year as its chairman issued a swipe at the lockdowns that ravaged the hospitality industry during the pandemic.\n\nThe company’s pre-tax profits surged 682% to £36m in the year to the end of January, compared to £4.6m in the previous 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nWetherspoon's reported that like-for-like sales grew by 9.9% in the 26 weeks to 28 January. But growth since the end of January has slowed, with like-for-like sales up 5.8% in the last seven weeks.\n\nChairman Tim Martin said: “The company continues to be concerned about the possibility of further lockdowns and about the efficacy of the government enquiry into the pandemic, which will not be concluded for several years.”\n\nRead more: Bank of England leaves interest rates unchanged at 5.25%\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “A lot of capacity has come out of the market and the hint that there might be potential of about 1,000 pubs compared to a current total of 814, could see the estate start to grow again. That may see the return of dividends kicked further down the road.\n\n“Location is key and recent openings include the Stargazer at the old Millenium Dome in Greenwich and the Star Light at Heathrow Airport. Overall, returning the estate to growth could be a welcome development. But there’s only so much you can grow if pub numbers remain static, and for now like-for-like growth has taken a step down. 5.8% isn’t awful but if it stays at this level for the rest of the year the market’s likely to be disappointed.”\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nThe proposed merger between mobile networks Vodafone and Three could lead to “customers facing higher prices and reduced quality”, the UK's competition watchdog has warned.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal will now face an in-depth investigation unless both companies can soon address their worries.\n\nVodafone and Three first announced the £15bn merger last summer. It would create the UK’s largest mobile phone network.\n\nThe two mobile firms have argued the deal will allow them to increase investment and better compete with major rivals, EE operator BT and Virgin Media-O2.\n\nWatch: Reddit stock jumps by nearly 50% in first day of trading<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDDT?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">RDDT</a>) made its <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-stock-soars-in-highly-anticipated-market-debut-172445008.html\\\">debut on the New York Stock Exchange,</a> soaring to an intraday high of $57 per share. tastylive Founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his outlook and stake in the company.</p>\\n<p>Sosnoff states that Reddit piqued his interest because it was a relatively \\\"cheap shot,\\\" and the social media aspect made it a \\\"reasonable investment.\\\" He notes that when investors buy companies that are not yet public, \\\"there's no exit strategy.\\\" However, he acknowledges that even though he is currently locked-up in the stock, he \\\"appreciates what they do.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Sosnoff goes on to explain that he is hopeful in the stock, saying it's \\\"the closest thing to a digital asset for a social media company.\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-172947861.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.</p>\\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/angel-smith/\\\"><em>Angel Smith</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fU7TaDWxmaPdxDlARUiibw--~B/aD0xMTk5O3c9MjEzMTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/df2c13a0-e7c7-11ee-9fa5-311921e7bb83\",\"duration\":\"PT6M8S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/6158cc28-443c-3734-9de4-adf4e116e31b.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/reddit-closest-thing-digital-asset-215101511.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"6158cc28-443c-3734-9de4-adf4e116e31b\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it was filing an antitrust lawsuit on Apple, the maker of the iPhone. But as that news broke, CEO Tim Cook was on the other side of the world. The Apple chief executive is in China, one of the company's most important overseas markets where the iPhone maker faces both stiff competition and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nCook is in China ahead of the China Development Forum, Beijing's big CEO summit featuring global executives. Cook is reportedly attending the forum.\n\nThe Apple CEO, a frequent visitor to China, seems to be on a charm offensive. There's \"no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Cook said on Wednesday in an interview with the media at Shanghai. China is a key manufacturing hub for Apple products, with suppliers like Foxconn operating massive iPhone assembly plants in Chinese cities like Zhengzhou.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Cook helped open a new Apple story in Shanghai. The retail outlet, Apple's 47th in mainland China, is the largest in the country and the second-largest globally, after Apple's Fifth Avenue location in New York City.\n\nLast week, Apple announced that it will expand its operations in Shanghai and Shenzhen to strengthen testing and research capabilities for products like the iPad, iPhone and Vision Pro.\n\nApple's China challenges\n\nCook is in China as Apple's sales in the country come under pressure.\n\nApple reported $20.8 billion in China sales for the three months ending Dec. 31, 2023, 17% of its total quarterly revenue. Yet the figure represents a 13% year-on-year decline.\n\nThe company's sales in China for the first six weeks of 2024 are down 24% year-on-year, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Apple's loss has been Huawei's gain: The latter's new Mate 60 Pro smartphone, with a locally-made advanced processor, helped boost the Chinese tech company's sales by 64% in the first six weeks of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA slowing Chinese economy could also be pushing more cautious consumers away from Apple's premium products. Overall smartphone sales in China fell 7% on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 according to Counterpoint’s data.\n\nApple is also reportedly trying to move some of its production outside China. Apple suppliers like Foxconn and Luxshare are setting up facilities in Vietnam and India.\n\nLast year Beijing reportedly ordered employees at government department and state-owned enterprises to stop using Apple products.\n\nNot just China\n\nApple is facing challenges on all fronts. European officials are scrutinizing Apple's rules for its app store, under the region's new Digital Markets Act.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice and 16 states filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and limiting consumer choice. In particular, U.S. officials accused Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its devices, and of abusing its control of the app store to make it harder for consumers to switch phones.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson told The Vergethat the lawsuit sets \"a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.\"\n\nApple shares fell 4.1% in Thursday trading, following the announcement of the lawsuit.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "44% of Warren Buffett's $366 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Widely Owned Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "For the better part of six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a show for Wall Street and the investing community. Despite being fallible just like every other investor, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as he's affably known, has overseen a monstrous aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 4,995,105%, as of the closing bell on March 15.\n\nExtensive books have been written detailing the \"recipe\" Buffett has used to vastly outperform the benchmark S&P 500. Typically, this means seeking out brand-name businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut you might be surprised to learn that three of the 45 stocks Buffett and his investment team are currently holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $366 billion portfolio are cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. According to estimates from PwC, AI solutions -- i.e., software and systems handling tasks that would normally be assigned to humans -- can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by the end of the decade.\n\nAs of March 15, 44% ($159 billion) of the $366 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was being put to work in three widely owned AI stocks -- and no, Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nApple: $156,317,767,200 (42.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe lion's share of Buffett's \"AI holdings\" can be traced to the largest position in Berkshire's investment portfolio: tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple accounts for more than 4 times the weighting of Bank America, which is Berkshire's second-largest holding (10% of invested assets).\n\nAlthough Apple isn't developing the infrastructure that's made Nvidia the foundation of the AI movement, AI solutions are embedded in virtually all of its products and are critical to the company's long-term growth strategy. Apple uses AI to improve the autocorrect and word suggestion capabilities of its U.S. market-share-leading iPhone, and recently launched its mixed-reality Vision Pro headset, which incorporates eye- and hand-tracking using AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile artificial intelligence solutions are staples in Apple's products, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, undoubtedly purchased shares of Apple for different reasons.\n\nOne of the primary lures of Apple is its exceptional customer loyalty. It's one of the most well-known and valuable global brands. Sustaining a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market means consumers eagerly await the annual launch of a new iPhone.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is likely also enamored with Apple's top-notch management team. In addition to constantly improving the functionality of iPhone and developing the Apple Watch, Apple CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a transformation that's seen his company become more services oriented. Emphasizing subscription services should steadily improve Apple's margins, smooth out the sales fluctuations observed during the tail end of major iPhone upgrade cycles, and encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThe other reason Buffett is a big fan of Apple is the company's unmatched capital-return program. Apple returned just a hair over $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders last year, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $651 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. This means Berkshire is steadily becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to lift a finger.\n\nAmazon: $1,744,200,000 (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock you'll find nestled in Warren Buffett's $366 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAmazon is utilizing AI in more ways than can be counted here. Some examples include analyzing what you're purchasing and putting in your shopping cart to recommend new products, as well as allowing its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to build applications using generative AI to tailor advertisements and improve customer interactions.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is developing its own graphics processing units (GPUs) for its in-house data centers that could complement, or even replace, the GPUs from Nvidia that have taken the AI movement by storm.\n\nWhile most people are familiar with Amazon because of its overwhelmingly dominant online marketplace, it's actually the company's ancillary operating segments that do a majority of the heavy lifting. Arguably no segment is more important than AWS.\n\nLast year, AWS accounted for about a sixth of Amazon's net sales, but was responsible for two-thirds of the company's operating income. Enterprise cloud spending still appears to be in its relatively early innings of expansion, which suggests AWS has many years of double-digit sales growth ahead. As of September 2023, AWS led all other cloud infrastructure service platforms with a 31% share of global spend.\n\nInterestingly enough, Amazon is fairly inexpensive, too. Shares can be scooped up right now for a greater than 40% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period. While this may not be the traditional \"value stock\" Buffett looks for, it's certainly something that has piqued the interest of one or both of his top investment aides. Images source: Getty Images.\n\nSnowflake: $961,500,271 (0.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe third AI stock that, collectively with Apple and Amazon, accounts for approximately 44% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). This is another Berkshire holding that was almost certainly added because of the influence of Weschler or Combs.\n\nSnowflake really put itself on the map of AI investors this past summer when it announced a collaboration with Nvidia that would allow Snowflake accounts to utilize Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. Snowflake is also making generative AI solutions available to its customers to assist with training, customizing, and deploying large language models.\n\nWhat's really drawn investors to Snowflake since it went public in September 2020 is its well defined competitive advantages. For instance, it can be challenging for users of competing cloud infrastructure service platforms to share information. Since Snowflake built its infrastructure atop the most popular cloud platforms, sharing and transferring data is seamless.\n\nCustomers also seem to appreciate Snowflake's transparent pricing policy. Instead of utilizing subscription pricing like many of its peers, Snowflake has opted to charge users based on how much data they store and how many Snowflake Compute Credits they use.\n\nBut in spite of these well-defined competitive edges, justifying Snowflake's premium valuation has been challenging. Its days of triple-digit sales growth are long gone. With businesses still cautious about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, Snowflake's annual sales growth is expected to slow to approximately 22% in the current fiscal year. At north of 160 times estimated earnings per share, investors might be wise to keep their distance and allow Snowflake to grow into its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Neither company is moving fast enough to field consumer products that generate revenue and grab market share, and, despite their size and power, they remain vulnerable to being disrupted. Even as engineers labor to perfect the large language models undergirding the technology, the companies are forming alliances and scouring the world for talent and promising startups.\n\nForging a leading position in generative AI requires each of the tech giants to assemble various ingredients—computing power, top-of-the-line AI models, trustworthy and easy-to-use products and ways of getting them to people. None of the tech giants has all of the ingredients. Google, once the pioneer in large language models, keeps releasing products with worrying errors and biases. Microsoft got a head start with exclusive access to many of OpenAI’s ground-breaking models, but has never been skilled at building exciting consumer products besides video games. Apple is years behind in AI and planning to announce a comeback strategy in June, but it does have the iPhone and app store.\n\n“Even large tech companies and cloud providers, with their vast resources, cannot innovate the entire generative AI ecosystem single handedly,” said Ido Caspi, a research analyst at Global X ETFs. “Companies must constantly be on the lookout for the best talent and technology to fill gaps in their portfolios.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella isn’t satisfied with his team’s efforts to create consumer products, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Over the past year, the company has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products—creating various digital assistants under the new Copilot brand. Yet the new Bing has made few gains against search market leader Google, and the other products are works in progress. Though OpenAI has given Microsoft a first mover advantage, the startup is focused on the underlying technology not developing products for the software giant.\n\nThat’s why Nadella recruited Suleyman to be executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, along with Inflection AI co-founder Karén Simonyan, who will become chief scientist of the new unit. Nadella wanted someone to unify and oversee product development and believes he found that person in Suleyman, with whom he bonded during conversations about how AI could be tailored to individual users.\n\n“Really all we’re trying to do is craft a true end-to-end product experience, so the user feels that there is a seamless, fluid, human-like conversational interaction,” Suleyman said in an interview Monday. He likened the work to sculpting and said “that art requires you to know the real sweet spot of when a piece of technology is ready and how to dress the experience so that it has an essence and a character which is familiar and accessible and trusted.”\n\nNadella also knows that because AI will completely transform the industry, even Microsoft’s flagship products aren’t immune to disruption—whether by a peer like Google or a startup that hasn’t even been invented yet. “These businesses are big and they’re all going to get re-litigated, right?” Nadella said in an interview. “So even the incumbents can’t take it for granted.”\n\nNadella’s faith in Suleyman isn’t universally shared. During his time at Google’s DeepMind, Suleyman wasn’t focused on consumer products. At Inflection AI, he oversaw the development of a chatbot called Pi that was designed to interact with users in a more human and supportive fashion. But despite attracting a million active daily users, the startup never found a business case. Suleyman was also accused of treating DeepMind employees poorly. He has acknowledged making mistakes and says he learned from the experience. Still, it’s unclear how well he’ll mesh with Microsoft’s existing team.\n\nThe proposed partnership between Google and Apple is still being worked out so there are few details of how exactly it would work. But assuming the deal comes to fruition, it could help each company with their AI efforts.\n\nSince early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model codenamed Ajax, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees also have been trying out a basic chatbot dubbed Apple GPT. But Apple’s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option. Apple could ultimately team up with another company, including OpenAI, or several.\n\nGoogle has raced to weave AI into its products, but the company has been dogged by concerns that it’s been too slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft. Last month, the company pulled an image generator amid a flurry of criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. A deal with Apple would be Google’s highest-profile partnership for Gemini to date and could be a major boon for the company’s AI efforts. Apple has more than 2 billion devices in active use that could potentially become home to Google Gemini later this year.\n\nPushing Google’s AI tools to as many devices as possible could help make them the ones users turn to reflexively, as they do with the company’s search engine, creating a virtuous cycle whereby the programs become sharper and sharper with additional user data. Earlier this year, Google struck a deal with Samsung Electronics Co. to incorporate its Gemini technology into the South Korean company’s phones, offering a glimpse of how Google could leverage its relationships with Android device manufacturers in the age of generative AI.\n\nIndustry observers expect tech companies to continue collaborating and investing in startups to augment their services and avoid being disrupted. “They need each other, especially in a space like AI which requires engineering expertise and lots of computing power,” said Dan Wang, a Columbia Business School professor who teaches innovation and entrepreneurship. “It’s a sensible way for the large tech companies to spread out the risk.” No one, he added, “has really found a killer application just yet that people are willing to pay for.”\n\n--With assistance from Mark Bergen, Mark Gurman and Julia Love.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights The Apple AAPL and New York Community Bank NYCB.\n\nDoJ Takes a Bite Out of Apple, Buffett Sours on the Stock\n\nApple: One of America’s Great Companies\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.\n\nChinks in the Armor?\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a “free market” person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.\n\nRelative Weakness\n\nWeakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank was underperforming – a subtle clue of the damage to come.\n\nCurrently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.\n\nBear Flag Pattern\n\nAAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume – a bearish sign.\n\nLack of Innovation\n\nApple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the “wow” factor in new iPhone releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett Souring on AAPL Shares?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire’s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFlat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "15 Industries Which Produce the Most Billionaires",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 industries which produce the most billionaires. We have also talked about the latest news surrounding billionaires and their wealth. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries that Produce the Most Billionaires.\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 billionaires experienced a phenomenal increase in wealth, collectively amassing an additional $465.6 billion—an impressive 46% increase compared to the S&P 500's 24% annual gain. Leading this financial ascent was Elon Musk, whose net worth catapulted from $137 billion to $229 billion within the year, followed closely by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s Mark Zuckerberg, who increased from $45.6 billion to $128 billion.\n\nEven philanthropic endeavors couldn't halt the upward trajectory of billionaire wealth. Warren Buffett, despite donating $5 billion in June and $870 million in November of the previous year, witnessed $13 billion increase in his net worth since January 2, 2023.\n\nNonetheless, despite the increase in billionaire wealth, President Biden proposed major tax reforms in his State of the Union address on March 8, 2024 with an aim to increase taxes on billionaires and corporations. Biden suggested raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and implementing a minimum tax for billionaires at 25%. He highlighted the disparity in tax rates, noting that some of America's wealthiest individuals pay lower federal taxes than average citizens. Additionally, Biden emphasized the need to end tax breaks for industries such as Big Pharma and Big Oil, while also advocating for a reduction in CEO salaries.\n\nThese proposals represent Biden's attempt to distinguish his progressive agenda from his Republican rival, Donald Trump, ahead of the upcoming elections. However, the feasibility of these reforms remains uncertain, as they require congressional approval.\n\nWhile billionaires are the highlight of our discussion, let’s talk about achieving the millionaire status now. In a survey by Ameriprise Financial, 80% of Americans with $1 million or more in investable assets attributed their financial success to financial planning and investing. Additionally, 70% acknowledged making a good income and living within their means as key factors. Only 13% credited luck for their wealth. Between 2019 and 2022, approximately 6 million American households saw their net worth exceed $1 million. Ameriprise's study, focusing on 580 Americans, aimed to understand how individuals reached the $1 million savings milestone. The study revealed that 85% of respondents associated wealth with financial security, 66% linked it to providing for family, and 58% to personal freedom.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, another study found that middle-aged and millennial workers estimated needing $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for comfortable retirement, yet less than a third of each group expected to achieve these goals. While 60% of millionaires considered themselves upper middle class, only 8% classified themselves as wealthy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the light of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s trajectory, its capitalization and diverse business portfolio, the prospect of achieving millionaire status through investment in the tech giant has become more tangible. The company's stock growth over recent decades has been remarkable, with its market capitalization nearing $3 trillion, surpassing even Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite a seemingly lofty valuation, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s diverse business model spanning cloud services, gaming, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence positions it as a leader across various tech sectors. Its solid financial foundation, with over $140 billion in cash reserves and significant operating cash flow, ensures resilience and agility in navigating market fluctuations and seizing growth opportunities through innovation or acquisitions. While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock may command a premium, its potential to sustain market-beating returns remains promising, supported by its ongoing technological advancements and established market presence.\n\nInvestors looking to secure a place in the millionaire club should weigh Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock alongside other options. While its valuation might appear steep compared to peers like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s strong growth prospects and financial strength offer a compelling case for long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, the Walton family stands atop America's richest families list with a monumental net worth of $267 billion as of 2024, primarily fueled by their major stake in Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer. Holding an estimated 45% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s stock, the family's wealth is distributed among seven heirs of Sam and Bud Walton, the founders. Rob Walton's tenure as chairman and strategic investments, such as the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos for $4.7 billion, have contributed to their financial prowess. Additionally, their fortune is further strengthened by the ownership of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Rams and Arsenal, through Stan Kroenke's ties to the family.\n\nSpeaking of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), it is also the largest private employer in the US. 15 Industries Which Produce the Most Billionaires\n\nA busy cityscape of financial buildings, emphasizing the importance of the industry for the economy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine industries which produce the most billionaires, we analyzed Forbes' 2023 Billionaires list. By dividing the number of billionaires in each industry by the total number of billionaires on the list, we calculated the percentage share of billionaires for each industry. Consequently, we arranged the industries in ascending order based on their share of billionaires.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Sports\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.4%\n\nIn 2023, a dozen new billionaires emerged from the sports industry, marking a major trend in wealth creation. LeBron James and Tiger Woods notably became the first active athletes to achieve a billion-dollar net worth, symbolizing the immense financial potential within sports. Booming media rights deals have skyrocketed team values and athlete earnings, with 94 of the top 100 US telecasts being sports events. Ownership of sports teams, exemplified by figures like Mark Davis and Amy Adams Strunk, has become a cornerstone asset for many, yielding substantial returns. Given the potential, sports is one of the most powerful future billionaire industries.\n\n14. Logistics\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.5%\n\nThe logistics industry stands out as a surprising source of immense wealth, with only 35 billionaires globally attributing their fortunes to this sector. Among them, eight are Chinese, and six are American. As of March 8, 2023, there are only three female billionaires in logistics. Johnelle Hunt leads the pack with a net worth of $4.5 billion, followed by Xiaojuan Zhang with $1.8 billion, and Liying Chen with $1.1 billion.\n\n13. Construction and Engineering\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.7%\n\nThe construction and engineering industry has unparalleled potential for producing billionaires, evidenced by the net worths of its top figures. Diane Hendricks leads the list with a colossal $22.4 billion fortune, followed by Nassef Sawiris at $8.5 billion, Anthony Bamford at $7.1 billion, and Thomas Schmidheiny at $6.5 billion. Rafael Del Pino and Peter Gilgan claim the fifth and sixth spots with $5.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.\n\n12. Automotive\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.80%\n\nApart from being one of the industries which produce the most billionaires in the world, automotive engineering stands as the breeding ground for billionaire women, like Susanne Klatten, Gail Miller, and Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler, that have amassed huge amounts of wealth. Klatten's strategic investments and BMW ownership contribute to her $26.4 billion fortune, while Miller's diversified business empire yields $3.9 billion. Schaeffler's leadership in auto parts manufacturing, valued at $8.2 billion, highlights the sector's lucrative opportunities.\n\n11. Metals and Mining\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.84%\n\nAs one of the best industries to become a billionaire, the metals and mining industry harbors immense potential for creating billionaires, as evidenced by the incredible net worth figures of its top players. With Savitri Jindal leading the list at $31.1 billion, followed closely by Gina Rinehart with $30.8 billion, it's evident that fortunes in this sector go up to astronomical heights. The industry's top ten billionaires collectively amass over $235 billion, showcasing the immense wealth generation capacity.\n\n10. Media and Entertainment\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 3%\n\nThe media and entertainment industry is globally known as the billionaire-producing powerhouse due to its multifaceted nature and global reach. Giants like Disney, Comcast, and Netflix have capitalized on their innovative content creation, distribution platforms, and strategic acquisitions to amass vast fortunes. Additionally, the convergence of technology with media has birthed moguls like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who capitalized on streaming services through Amazon Prime Video. From film production to streaming services, the industry's ability to capture the attention and wallets of billions worldwide ensures its continuous growth.\n\n9. Energy\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 4%\n\nEnergy is one of the industries that makes the most money in the world and hence, most billionaires. Companies like ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Chevron dominate this landscape, propelled by the perpetual demand for oil, gas, and renewable energy sources. The sector's inherent capital-intensive nature, coupled with its strategic importance in driving economies, fosters immense wealth accumulation for its key players.\n\n8. Diversified\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nComprising 7% of the list, there are 187 billionaires categorized under diversified industries in 2023 by Forbes. The wealthiest among them is Mukesh Ambani, with a net worth of $83.4 billion. Ambani serves as the chairman of Reliance Industries, a conglomerate with investments spanning petrochemicals, oil and gas, retail, and telecommunications sectors, showcasing a wide-ranging portfolio of interests. Hence, it is not wrong to say there are diversified industries which can produce the most billionaires in India.\n\n7. Real Estate\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nAs one of the top 10 industries which produce the most billionaires, real estate comprises 7% of the list with 193 billionaires in 2023. The richest within this category is Donald Bren, with a net worth of $17.4 billion. Bren serves as the chairman of Irvine Co., an important real estate firm headquartered in California.\n\n6. Healthcare\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 8%\n\nThe healthcare industry is a titan in billionaire production, making it one of the popular fields that make the most billionaires. Among the Forbes World’s Billionaires List, comprising 2,640 members with a collective net worth of $12.2 trillion, healthcare magnates command a major presence. Notably, Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of the Serum Institute of India, ranks 68th globally with a fortune exceeding $22.6 billion, while Thomas Frist, Jr., co-founder of HCA Healthcare, sits at #81 with $20.2 billion.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 US states with the highest labor shortages. We have also discussed the implications of the labor shortages for businesses. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\nThe labor shortage gripping the United States is starkly evident: with 9.5 million job openings but only 6.5 million unemployed workers, a deficit of 3 million remains. Despite the addition of 4.5 million jobs in 2022, the shortage persists, exacerbated by declining labor force participation rates since before the pandemic. This shortage spans industries and states, impacting businesses of all sizes and types, hindering their ability to fill essential roles. It is worth highlighting that healthcare is one of the most affected industries due to labor shortages in the US.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this crisis. Early retirements increased during the pandemic, with over 3 million adults opting for early retirement by October 2021. Simultaneously, net international migration plummeted, slowing population growth and constraining the labor pool.\n\nMoreover, shifts in economic dynamics, such as increased savings due to enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, compounded the shortage. The \"Great Reshuffle\" saw record quit rates as workers sought better opportunities or opted for entrepreneurship. While solutions are being pursued, the multifaceted nature of the shortage demands comprehensive approaches addressing retirement trends, immigration policies, childcare accessibility, and economic incentives to entice workers back into the labor force.\n\nOwing to the major labor shortages in country, several businesses across the country have been disrupted. Thousands of businesses have reduced hours or closed due to unfilled positions, causing a ripple effect in various industries. The scarcity of workers not only slows production but also leads to price pressures on goods ranging from cars to household essentials like baby formula and cleaning products. To read more about skilled labor shortages, see the countries with the highest labor shortages in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe situation is dire, with over 50 million US workers leaving their jobs in 2022, the highest number on record. Economists have termed it \"quiet quitting\". However, there's nothing subtle about the challenges facing America's workforce. Industries such as transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare are particularly hard-hit, struggling to find essential personnel like truck drivers, hotel staff, and healthcare technicians.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that a substantial portion of these labor shortages are essentially skill labor shortages. To address these skill shortages, many companies have been trying to bridge the gap through several initiatives.\n\nFor example, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers free education and training programs to equip learners with AI skills for tomorrow’s workforce. With AI transforming various industries, including finance, IT, sales, and marketing, demand for AI-trained professionals is growing. A survey conducted in four US regions revealed that over 60% of educators believe AI skills are essential for future high-paying careers. However, despite this recognition, many educators lack resources to teach AI effectively, with 69% reporting a shortage of necessary materials and training programs. To read more about AI transformation, see industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies.\n\nThe study also suggests a modest increase in AI courses in US schools, expected to rise by approximately 1.5 times in the next five years. Recognizing the need to bridge this gap, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched its AI Ready initiative, aiming to provide free AI skills training to 2 million individuals by 2025. The initiative aligns with findings that show strong demand for AI talent, with potential salary increases of up to 47% for workers with AI skills. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports educators and students through various programs, including funding STEM curriculum, offering scholarships, and providing career exploration opportunities.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has partnered with industry experts to predict AI-enabled careers of the future. These roles span diverse sectors, from precision farming analysts leveraging AI to optimize agricultural processes to cosmic reality engineers visualizing distant galaxies using advanced AI systems. As AI continues to reshape industries, preparing students and professionals with foundational AI skills becomes crucial. By investing in education and training, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)  aims to empower individuals for a tech-enabled workforce, fostering innovation and addressing the evolving demands of tomorrow’s job market.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched updated professional training and certifications for IT support and management, responding to the growing demand for skilled technical staff. With projections indicating faster-than-average growth in computer and information systems occupations from 2020 to 2030, the need for proficient IT professionals is evident. This demand is further fueled by the increasing use of  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac in workplaces. The redesigned training is now available online, providing self-paced learning opportunities.\n\nThe training comprises two sequential courses:  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  Device Support and  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Deployment and Management. These courses equip learners with essential skills for supporting and managing  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, covering topics such as device deployment, management, and security using mobile device management solutions. Upon completion of each course, learners can take certification exams to demonstrate their competence, enhancing their job prospects in the competitive IT landscape.\n\nTo ensure accessibility,  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  offers scholarships for exam fees through its Community Education Initiative (CEI) at partnering institutions. Additionally, the Mac Admins Foundation collaborates with  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  to provide vouchers to applicants with financial need, promoting inclusivity and affordability in accessing certification exams. 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages\n\nGts/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the states with the highest labor shortages, we used unemployment level for the number of workers available in each states and utilized the averaged data between September and November 2023 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We calculated the ratio of workers available for every 100 job openings. The list is presented in descending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

District of Columbia (DC)\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nDC is facing a major deficit in case workers, with vacancies reaching approximately 30% in the School Behavioral Health Program. Despite efforts like Operation Make Movement to expedite housing subsidies, staffing constraints persist, with a workforce survey revealing a 21% vacancy rate across organizations. To address this crisis, the D.C. Council approved a bill funding graduate degrees in social work, aiming to alleviate shortages by subsidizing education for 20 Washingtonians initially, with plans to expand to 40 annually.\n\n14. Colorado\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nColorado has a strong labor force with a 68.8% participation rate, 5 points above the national average, and a pre-pandemic unemployment rate of 3.2%, below the national average. Before the pandemic, there were 79 workers for every 100 open positions. As of August 2023, the labor market has largely recovered, with unemployment and participation rates back to pre-pandemic levels. However, a worsening worker shortage is evident, with only 50 workers available for every 100 open jobs.\n\n13. Tennessee\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nAs one of the states with the worst labor shortages in 2024, Tennessee is also struggling with a concerning teacher shortage, as revealed by a recent analysis from the State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE). Statewide, there are approximately 60,000 teachers in the workforce, with over 1,000 unfilled vacancies, a third of which are in the critical K-5 grade band. While nearly a third of districts reported no vacancies, the state's shortage aligns with the national average.\n\n12. Virginia\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47\n\nAs one of the states that need the most workers, Virginia was ranked in the \"more severe\" category, according to the US Chamber of Commerce. Data reveals a stark contrast from pre-pandemic times, with 245,000 job openings and only 112,959 unemployed workers, resulting in 47 available workers for every 100 open positions. Despite rebounding labor force participation rates and low unemployment figures, the state faces challenges in filling vacancies, exacerbated by factors like decreased immigration and pandemic-induced workforce shifts.\n\n11. Montana\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47\n\nThe state of Montana is plagued with a severe labor deficit with a Worker Shortage Index at 0.47. Job openings have increased to 35,000 while only 14,691 are unemployed. The labor force participation rate stagnates at 62.7, with a mere 2.5% unemployment rate. The quit rate peaks at 3.1, confirming dissatisfaction, while the hiring rate rests at 4.8.\n\n10. South Carolina\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nSouth Carolina is fighting with an alarming labor shortage, particularly evident in the agricultural sector. Titan Farms, one of the largest peach growers on the East Coast, is currently facing the challenge of filling 1,200 positions with only two U.S.-born workers willing to take on the job. The peach industry alone contributes $400 million to the state's economy, yet without the federal H-2A work visa program, crucial agricultural businesses like Titan Farms would struggle to survive. The shortage stems from a shift in the workforce as more South Carolinians pursue careers outside of farm labor, opting for professions such as electricians, bankers, and lawyers.\n\n9. Massachusetts\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nMassachusetts faces a profound labor shortage with significant numbers indicating the severity. Approximately 10,000 Baby Boomers retire daily, contributing to the workforce gap. This situation is exacerbated by a national statistic showing 3.5 million more job openings than available workers. To address this, immigration reform is crucial, as immigrants significantly contribute to sectors like healthcare. Moreover, tackling housing costs and living expenses is vital for attracting and retaining talent within the state.\n\n8. Maine\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nDespite historically low immigrant populations, Maine's recent influx from Somalia and other African countries, particularly in cities like Portland and Lewiston, has supported the foreign-born demographic by about 1% between 2000 and 2022. The proposed Office of New Americans aims to address shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, education, and construction.\n\n7. Alabama\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nAlabama is facing a critical labor shortage, with only 57% of working-age adults actively seeking employment as of September 2023. This shortage amounts to nearly 100,000 more job openings than available workers. The scarcity of labor empowers workers to demand better wages and benefits, but it also poses challenges for businesses and policymakers.\n\n6. Nebraska\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 40\n\nNebraska faces a workforce challenge with only 40 available workers per 100 open jobs, resulting in a Worker Shortage Index of 0.39. Despite a low unemployment rate of 2.0%, job openings stand at 54,000 against 21,145 unemployed workers. The state's labor force participation rate is 69.2%, with a quit rate of 2.3% and a hiring rate of 3.6%.\n\nClick here to see the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In Europe 15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World 15 Best Countries That Need English Teachers\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "While the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple had been rumored for months, the complaint filed on Thursday against the iPhone maker by the Biden administration and 15 state attorneys general is nonetheless a stunner for Apple investors. The government contends that Apple violated antitrust laws by using an assortment of strategies to both cement the iPhone’s dominant position in the U.S. smartphone market and to build out a collection of services and peripherals that expands its power and reach. In a cruel twist, the Justice Department also contends that Apple’s longstanding self-positioning as a champion of user safety and privacy is largely a ruse intended to ensure control of the market for phones and related services.\n\nContinue reading",

        "title": "The DOJ’s blockbuster lawsuit against Apple boils down to long-running argument within tech",
        "content": "The legal showdown between the U.S. Department of Justice and Apple, which kicked off on Thursday morning, puts the spotlight on a thorny question that’s as old as the tech industry itself: How much control should a company have over its own creation?\n\nFrom the early days of personal computers to later debates over open source versus proprietary software, walled garden social networks versus open platforms, and even the recent push for so-called right to repair laws, it’s an issue that has come up—in some form or another—time and time again.\n\nTo hear the DOJ tell it, Apple has exercised excessive control over the iPhone, thereby limiting choices for consumers and protecting its profits. “This case is about freeing the smartphone market from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” reads the introduction to the 88-page complaint filed by the DOJ.\n\nApple, of course, sees things differently. A spokesperson for the tech giant told the Verge that it sets “a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”\n\nIndeed, the idea that Apple’s products “just work” has long been a central pillar of the company’s branding — consumers don’t need to know what a software driver is, or spend hours on the phone with tech support, to use an Apple product; just plug it in and have fun. The tightly scripted experience is the selling point.\n\nAnd the tight control that Apple exerts on the platform—in terms of the third-party apps it allows in its App store and the ability for third-party apps to access some of the iPhone's key functionality—has meant greater security and privacy for users in its castle.\n\nIn Apple's last fiscal year, that approach helped the company generate $383 billion in revenue, inspiring Wall Street investors to bid Apple’s stock market value to $2.65 trillion. The iPhone, a product that will celebrate its 17th birthday in June, brought in $200 billion in revenue last year.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Apple's obsession with its customer experience leads it to control the experience tightly, make decisions on its customers' behalf, and maintain an ecosystem that consistently delivers on the experience the brand promises,” Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at industry research firm Forrester, told Fortune. In essence, Chatterjee said, it’s a debate between whether users are better off with choice or curation.\n\nTo show that the market is craving more choice, instead of Apple’s tightly chaperoned model, the DOJ and the 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that joined it in the lawsuit, will have to demonstrate that consumers have been harmed.\n\nThat won’t be easy—not just because of the existence of an alternative, less rigidly controlled smartphone ecosystem based on Google’s Android software.\n\n“This is not timid litigation,” New York University law professor and antitrust expert Harry First said, noting that the government is “going after the heart of Apple's ecosystem and how Apple maintains control.”\n\nProduct design from DC?\n\nAmong the elements of the iPhone that the government says Apple stifles consumer choice on are the cloud-based gaming apps, messaging apps, and digital wallets.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, one of the states involved in the lawsuit, told Fortune in an interview that the Apple Wallet is a prime example of limited choice. “If consumers prefer it against other digital payment systems that’s fine, but what shouldn’t be happening is Apple preventing the use of alternatives that consumers may want to use but can’t.”\n\nStill, the idea that the government understands what consumers want better than a company like Apple is inherently tricky. And there’s no shortage of examples of government heavy handedness leading to inferior products.\n\nSteve Sinfosky, a former senior executive at Microsoft, pointed to the constraints imposed on the PC software giant following the DOJ’s antitrust case against it in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe biggest impact of the antitrust litigation, Sinosky tweeted Thursday, was to make Windows “worse for consumers.”\n\nA hunt for 'smoking gun' memos\n\nProving that Apple’s control harmed other companies might be easier. But here, antitrust experts like Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management professor Mark McCareins say, the government will need to come with the goods, like internal communications between Apple executives that show that the company’s conduct was exclusionary — that is, done without a legitimate business purpose such as improving the customer experience.\n\n“What documents and emails are unearthed in discovery by the DOJ will be critical,” said McCareins, who teaches courses on Antitrust and Competition.\n\nSinofsky, the former Microsoft executive, echoed this sentiment in his tweet thread on Thursday: “If this ever goes to trial you can bet that this case will distill down to a single-digit number of emails (there were 3 memorable ones in the MS case, IMO) or worse internal chat posts or Messages.”\n\nSo far, the internal emails highlighted in the complaint, while revealing, are not damning, according to many observers. As the case moves forward however and the government gets deeper access to Apple documents, it’s difficult to know what might emerge.\n\nWhile a “smoking gun” document would of course be a huge boon to the government’s case, the DOJ may see a benefit even if it only manages to expose a trove of less dispositive documents, according to the opinion of some observers.\n\n“They must know this case will be hard to win. Maybe they feel their best path to victory is creating a strong public atmosphere that Apple is not some noble, pro-consumer actor,” said Geoffrey Manne, president and founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a Portland-based nonprofit research center.\n\n“A lot of these cases are about changing the public perception of these companies, which in turn deters the behavior.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the worst English accents in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Worst English Accents in the World.\n\nEnglish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, with approximately 1.5 billion speakers around the globe. It is recognized as an international business language and is taught as a mandatory skill in most of the countries. According to a report by The University of Winnipeg, 142 countries worldwide teach English as a mandatory element of their national curriculums. Moreover, 41 countries treat it as a popular foreign language.\n\nSpeaking good English brings enhanced business opportunities and attracts growth and profitability. According to a survey conducted by EF English First, business customers were willing to pay 16% extra to a supplier with a high level of English proficiency. On the other hand, 53% of the respondents view organizations without a good grasp of English as unprofessional. In addition, the subsequent research on the survey found that a high level of English proficiency could help grow your business by 31% in 5 years.\n\nEconomic Analysis of Countries with the Best English Accent\n\nAccording to data, the United States, the United Kingdom, and European countries have the best English accents. These highly proficient English-speaking countries are also recognized as some of the world's most advanced economies.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Outlook Report 2024 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth in the advanced economies is projected to slow down slightly to 1.6% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024 before rising again to 1.8% in 2025. In the United States, growth is anticipated to decline from 2.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, attributed to stringent fiscal and monetary policies and a deceleration in aggregate demand within the labor market. On the other hand, the economic growth in the euro region is expected to recover from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.9% in 2024, finally reaching 1.7% in 2025. The resilient comeback of the European economy is due to strong household consumption after a drop in inflation and oil prices and an improvement in real income growth. You can also look at the 12 Most Profitable Foreign Languages To Learn and Top 25 Most Spoken Languages In The World 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe economic outlook for the United Kingdom remains stable, with growth forecasted to increase from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.6% in 2024 and projected to reach 1.6% by 2025. These growth projections are moderate due to the influence of persistently high energy prices within the UK. Nevertheless, declining inflation rates and an uptick in real income are key drivers fueling this economic expansion.\n\nKey Players Leading the Economy of the United States\n\nThe United States is one of the leading economies of the world and it is also one of the countries with the highest English proficiency. Foreigners from various countries learn English and move to the United States, seeking better employment opportunities. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, the immigrant share of the total workforce in the United States reached an all-time high of 18.6% in 2023. Moreover, the immigrant labor force in the United States grows by 2.3% each year.

With that said, let's take a look at the countries with the worst English accents in the world. 20 Countries with Worst English Accent in the World\n\nlOvE lOvE/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of 20 countries with the worst English accents in the world, we utilized data from the 2022 IELTS test taker performance, primarily focusing on speaking band scores. Additionally, we incorporated English First’s English Performance Index scores and overall IELTS scores for each country as well. The list's ranking follows a descending order based on the IELTS speaking score band, serving as our primary metric, followed by the EPI Score as our secondary metric, and the overall IELTS score as our tertiary metric. When a tie-breaker was necessary, the secondary and tertiary metrics were used based on their priority. We have also mentioned population data for countries sourced from the World Bank.\n\nThe rationale behind using IELTS speaking scores was that this test is a globally renowned standardized test for English language proficiency for non-native English speakers. The IELTS band scores are ranked from 0 to 9, where 9 indicates an expert language user, and 0 indicates a non-user.\n\nImportant notes: Our list includes special administrative regions such as Hong Kong, the special administrative region of China.

        "title": "Why China's options in response to a TikTok ban are limited",
        "content": "Chinese officials decried the lack of “fairness” in the US last week following the swift passage of a House bill that called for Chinese company ByteDance to divest its popular social media app TikTok.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson for China accused the US of using national security as a guise to “willfully suppress other countries' superior companies,” strongly hinting that the Chinese government would block any forced sale of its most popular social media app.\n\nBut beyond preventing a spin-off, Chinese options for potential retaliation against the US remain limited, given the country’s current economic standing and its own policy of censorship, experts say.\n\n“The more that they take sort of retaliatory measures, that actually turbocharges that decoupling agenda that some have in Washington,” said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at The Peterson Institute for International Economics. “[That] would encourage firms to pull out of China because they wouldn't feel safe there.” Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, speaks to the press on March 13, 2024, after the ministry accused the US on Wednesday of bullying Tiktok. (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nChina weighs its options with TikTok\n\nThe latest congressional action marks another twist in a yearslong effort to limit the scale and influence of a social media app that has grown to more than 170 million users in the US.\n\nSince launching in 2017 as the international version of parent company ByteDance’s popular Chinese app Douyin, TikTok has become one of the most downloaded apps globally, along with Meta’s (META) Instagram.\n\nBut the vast amounts of data collected on the platform, as well as concerns about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to exert control over ByteDance, has raised the alarm for US lawmakers who have deemed TikTok’s ties to China a national security risk.\n\nIn congressional testimony, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has insisted that the company stores Americans' data in Virginia and Singapore, not China. However, the company later acknowledged there are some exceptions for creator data, as Forbes reported. Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, leaves a meeting in Sen. John Fetterman's office in the Russell Senate Office building on Thursday, March 14, 2024. (Bill Clark via Getty Images)\n\n“The Chinese government does have broad legal authorities to compel corporations in matters of national security,” said Colin Costello, a CFIUS and national security adviser at the Freshfields law firm. “So from the perspective of someone who views the Chinese government as an adversary and as a very capable adversary, the question is not has it been used, but can it be used? And the answer to that, ... from the perspective of the people who wrote this bill, is yes.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn't the first time Beijing has responded to threats of a US TikTok ban.\n\nIn 2020, after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively calling for the ban of TikTok and WeChat in the US, ByteDance immediately moved to update its export control rules. The changes restricted the export of “technology based on data analysis for personalized information recommendation service.”\n\nReva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, expects Beijing to intervene similarly if the Senate passes the House bill and President Joe Biden signs it into law to “demonstrate its own resistance to the US.” Visitors visit the TikTok booth at the Application & Electronics World Expo (AWE2024) in Shanghai, China, on March 14, 2024. (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nBut China’s own economic reality and a broad slowdown in foreign investments may also influence Beijing’s calculation in the scale of its response. Foreign direct investments in China fell to a 30-year low in 2023, weighed down in part by concerns over geopolitical tensions and an unpredictable business environment.\n\n“Beijing needs to weigh the risk of further alienating foreign investors when China’s economic challenges are already on full display,” Goujon said. “More defensive moves, whether on export controls, data security, or cybersecurity measures, will only drive companies deeper down the diversification path.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Beijing from responding in the past. Major American social media and online platforms, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Meta’s Facebook, and Snapchat (SNAP), have already been banned from the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe government also barred critical domestic infrastructure operators from purchasing Micron’s (MU) products last year, after Washington implemented export controls on key American components and chipmaking tools. Months later, China ordered employees at central government agencies to stop using Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, citing national security concerns.\n\nIf passed in the Senate, the TikTok bill sets a six-month deadline for TikTok to divest from ByteDance, a challenging scenario given the complexity of separating US assets from a global app.\n\nChorzempa said Beijing is unlikely to approve any deal, regardless of the price tag or corporate structure, in part because of what TikTok represents: a global social media success story made in China.\n\n“If Beijing is looking at a ban in the United States market compared to losing global control [over an app], it's not clear to me that it would prefer divestment and a payout for the existing shareholders over the loss of that channel,” Chorzempa said.\n\nIn part, he added, that's because the “abundance of Chinese actions in the last few years makes clear that the interests of shareholders and the financial interests of shareholders just do not come in very high on the list of Chinese government priorities.”\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are training their eyes on Apple Inc., unnerving investors with fears over fines and threatening its market dominance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Justice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Yemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be Targeted\n\nIn the US, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general are suing the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it’s complying with the region’s Digital Markets Act.\n\nShares of the company slid more than 4% Thursday, erasing about $115 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back past 11%. Once the world’s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024.\n\nIt’s not the first time Apple is coming under regulatory scrutiny. The company and its peers have for years faced accusations of enriching themselves by suppressing competitors. But as Apple’s products have grown ever-more popular and established themselves as part of daily life around the world, authorities have also become more combative and wary of its power.\n\nThe American suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, accuses Apple of blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The potential investigations in Europe, which are also targeting some of Apple’s rivals, will focus on the firm’s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers.\n\n“There comes a point in which the downpour of cases and scrutiny that comes with them become a real drag on how these companies operate,” said Bill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School. “Even if they win, in an important way they’ve lost.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple fired back at the US lawsuit by calling it “wrong on the facts and the law.” It warned that the action would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.” The company didn’t respond to a request for comment on the potential European probes.\n\nThe US lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.\n\nIt highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.\n\n“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”\n\nThe Digital Markets Act — which lays out a series of do’s and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations into Apple — as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google — regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.\n\nApple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) European Union fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein and Stephanie Bodoni.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Wall Street and Silicon Valley Elites Are Warming Up to Trump Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — It'll likely take years before the U.S. government's massive antitrust lawsuit against Apple is resolved — but the iPhone maker's troubles with European regulators offer a glimpse of what changes American customers may see down the line.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps in areas such as streaming, messaging and digital payments. The Department of Justice also wants to prevent the tech giant from building language into its contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that lets obtain or keep a monopoly.\n\nThese are similar to themes that the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, and Apple have been wrangling over for years.\n\nEU antitrust watchdogs have launched multiple antitrust cases accusing Apple of violating the 27-nation bloc's competition laws, while also imposing tough digital rules aimed at stopping tech companies from cornering digital markets.\n\nBrussels' efforts will soon start to have an impact on the way the company does business and the experience iPhone users have in Europe. And the changes could signal what's to come for U.S. Apple users — if the Justice Department has its way, at least.\n\nHere's a closer look:\n\nMUSIC STREAMING\n\nMusic streaming users typically weren't able to pay for their Spotify subscriptions directly through their iPhone apps. They couldn't even be informed by email of subscription prices, promos and offers by Spotify or other music streaming services. That's because Apple put tight restrictions on apps that competed with its own Apple Music service.\n\nBut when Spotify complained to the European Union, antitrust regulators opened a yearslong investigation that resulted last month in an order for Apple to stop such behavior and came with a whopping 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) fine aimed at deterring the company from doing it again.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Commission's competition chief, said Apple's practices were “illegal” and “impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions.”\n\nStory continues\n\nPAYMENTS\n\nApple tried to resolve a second EU antitrust case by proposing to let third party mobile wallet and payment service providers access the tap and go payment function on its iOS operating system.\n\nApple offered the concession to the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, after it accused the company in 2022 of abusing its dominant position by limiting access to its mobile payment technology.\n\nThe commission had been examining whether Apple Pay’s rules require online shops to make it the preferred or default option, effectively shutting out rival payment systems. It had also been investigating concerns that it limits access for rival payment systems to the contactless payment function on iPhones.\n\nThe commission is still mulling the offer. It has been seeking feedback from \"interested parties” on the proposals before making a decision on the case.\n\nAPP STORES\n\nApple has long maintained that there can be only one app marketplace — its own — on iPhones and other iOS devices. But a sweeping set of new EU regulations that recently took effect has forced the company to open up its so-called “walled garden” and allow third-party app stores to compete.\n\nThe EU's Digital Markets Act is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies with a set of do's and don'ts that they'll have to abide by. One of its goals is to break up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into one companies products or services.\n\nUnder the DMA, tech companies won't be able to stop consumers from connecting with businesses outside their platforms. So Apple has been forced to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant — a move it’s long resisted.\n\nIn a sign of that reluctance, EU regulators said they wanted to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store. But Apple later reversed course and cleared the way for Fortnite maker Epic to set up its rival app store.\n\n—-\n\nAP journalist Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer continues to focus on AI and the new investing opportunities it is creating. During his March 7 program on CNBC, Cramer wondered “how big is AI” and said the AI-led “technological revolution” is “crossing all barriers” and could potentially become the “heart” of the American national security apparatus. Jim Cramer said that AI could be key to making the “biggest amount of money” over the next five years.\n\nAI \"Bubble Busters\" Drive Jim Cramer \"Crazy\"\n\nJim Cramer yet again took a swing at AI naysayers who he called “bubble busters.” Cramer said these AI bears are “all around” him and it drives him “crazy.” After discussing Nvidia’s dominance in the AI industry and how the company is expected to remain at the top of the AI food chain because of its high performance chips, Jim Cramer started discussing stocks that would benefit from the AI revolution. Some of these companies would benefit from AI directly while others would see a huge demand for their products and services indirectly.\n\nCramer Picks Under-The-Radar AI Stocks\n\nJim Cramer also attended the recently-concluded Nvidia GTC conference and televised his program directly from there. Cramer said that there are many non-tech companies in partnership with Nvidia and keeping an eye on these companies could unlock huge opportunities for investors. Cramer believes these non-tech partners should “represent the best opportunities” since these companies usually stay under the radar.\n\nCramer often talks about mega-cap tech stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that will grow because of AI. But in this article we decided to take a look at some of the lesser known and under-the-radar stocks Jim Cramer believes would grow thanks to the AI revolution. Most of these are non-tech companies that would benefit from the AI wave directly or indirectly due to the AI ecosystem that is forming as companies begin to develop generative AI applications for hundreds and thousands of use cases.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 11 Stocks\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nJim Cramer is excited about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) after the company revealed its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer recently admitted he hasn’t been a fan of Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) in the past because the company became public via a SPAC. Most of the SPAC IPOs, according to Cramer, were “garbage.” However, Cramer said it’s time to open the books on Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) since he believes Nvidia’s partnership could infuse a “life” in the stock.\n\nIn addition to GETY, Cramer also recommends NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nDuring the company's Q4 earnings call Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)'s management talked about partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we announced and launched a truly unique generative image offering, an offering that is trained on licensed and released data and rewards content creators for the training, and offering that respects third-party intellectual property rights and a social and responsible and that it cannot produce deepfakes, an offering that is commercially safe and indemnified, an offering that produces high-quality outlets.\n\nWe launched Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) and VA-API in Q4, a nice stock in January of this year. Of course, with all things AI, the pace of innovation is break-neck. In recent weeks, we have already introduced expanded controls and capabilities such as in-panning and out-panning. We’ll be releasing a newly trained model soon and we will also enable AI capabilities across our entire pre-shop creative library. We also have big plans for video and partnership with NVIDIA and Runway, which we expect to launch later this year aligned to the commercial needs of our customers. While we continue to face macro challenges, as always we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers and long-term returns to our shareholders. At the core of Getty Images is high-quality content and coverage that is derived from top-notch talent, exclusive access, extensive research and rare expertise.\n\nWe pair this with world-class customer service across committed and long-standing relationships and the delivery of technology that truly enhances the creativity, productivity and efficiency of our customers without risks. With our solid foundation and clear vision and focus, we’re excited to return to growth in 2024.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nNextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is among the list of companies that are set to benefit from the rising demand of clean energy amid the AI-based data centers wave. Cramer thinks companies deploying massive data center resources for generative AI applications would need to power their systems via cheap energy, which should also be clean. Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) provides solutions to enhance the efficiency of solar energy systems. That’s why Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is poised to benefit in the coming days.\n\nLast month Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) posted strong quarterly results. J.P. Morgan increased its price target on the stock to $73 from $61.\n\nDuring its Q3 earnings call Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) talked about data center-driven demand and opportunities:\n\n\"Over the last few years however, energy usage has increased dramatically driven by growth and data centers, electrification of appliances and transportation and reindustrialization across the United States. At the same time there has been a significant retirement of legacy power plants.\n\nThe combination of these factors has caused the U.S. Energy Information Administration to forecast a 5% annual increase need for new power generation capacity in the grid over the next five years. The result is that almost 300 gigawatts of new power plants are needed over the next five years and about 500 gigawatts of new power is needed over the next decade. Where is this massive amount of new power going will come from? The U.S. CIA historically very conservative on renewables is forecasting that solar and wind power will comprise the vast majority of new power generation. Solar is expected to have a 26% compound annual growth over the next five years and within 10 years be the number one source of electric generation in the United States comprising almost a quarter of all electric energy.\n\nNaysayers point to the intermittency of renewable power as an impediment to its large scale adoption in the grid. We believe this issue will improve. Sharp decreases in battery costs have enable steep ramping of battery storage, power plants in the grid both co-located with renewable power and standalone project.\"\n\nRead the full earnings all transcript here.\n\n8. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nJim Cramer, who has been bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) for the past several months, thinks the huge rise of datacenters after the AI wave could further boost Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) since the company would play a key role in AI infrastructure building.\n\nIn January, Cramer grilled Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) bears, who, according to the analyst, were talking about “bogus” concerns about inventory slowdown problems for the company. Cramer, whose charitable trust owns a stake in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), said he held onto the stock and got rewarded. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shares are up by about 58% over the past one year.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, also performed well this quarter. Caterpillar has managed to leverage increased capital investment from various end markets, contributing to better than expected fiscal results for Q2. The company is poised to be one of the largest beneficiaries of several government funding initiatives, including the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) bill, CHIPS Act and infrastructure bill. These measures are expected to support construction spending for several years, providing a robust backdrop for Caterpillar’s continued growth.”\n\n7. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nJim Cramer recently said that the rise of generative AI applications are creating huge demand for data centers, which in turn creates demand for power and energy management solutions. Cramer said AI data centers have to be connected to the grid that have low energy costs and “for many” this energy has to be clean. This is where companies like Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) come into play, according to Cramer. Cramer said that Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) is helping major companies become carbon neutral as it provides clean energy.\n\n6. Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) because the company has a partnership with Nvidia. Cramer believes the new AI wave could revolutionize the medical diagnostics systems. In a latest program, Cramer said Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) could create a more effective endoscopy module to better detect colorectal cancer.\n\nIn addition to MDT, Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is the largest medical technology company in the world. Despite a few tough years characterized by post-COVID supply chain issues, Chinese market payment changes, and diabetes business challenges, the company has continued to invest aggressively in its R&D pipeline. Because of this long-term mindset and commitment to product innovation, the company is in a position today where it has numerous significant new product launches across the business, helping to accelerate growth and improve profitability. More recently, the market’s infatuation with the promise of GLP-1 drugs has resulted in valuation de-ratings across the medtech industry broadly, to which Medtronic was not immune. The combination of all of these factors has resulted in Medtronic shares trading at their lowest valuation in a decade. Given the emerging business momentum, we felt the valuation offers a compelling chance to increase our weight in the world’s largest medtech company.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 9 Stocks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "With the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning, you may be tricked into thinking that all tech stocks are big winners in 2024. But you’d be wrong, particularly when considering semiconductor companies. Plenty of struggling semiconductor stocks to sell quickly before they seriously damage your investment portfolio.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association says that global sales of semiconductors dropped 8.2% in 2023, to $526.8 billion. Sales were off primarily because the personal computer industry slowed down and didn’t order as many semiconductor chips. Add to that slowing consumer electronics and server sales in general, and the semiconductor industry faced some challenging times.\n\nAnd while sales started to improve in the year’s second half, many semiconductor stocks have yet to regain their momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe can use the Portfolio Grader to pick out several struggling semiconductor stocks today. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on earnings performance, growth, momentum, and analyst sentiment. Stocks that get bad grades are given “D” or “F” ratings.\n\nThese stocks are among the worst semiconductor stocks you can buy now.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWolfspeed (NASDAQ:WOLF) is a manufacturer of next-generation semiconductors. It uses silicon carbide technologies to make semiconductors for electric vehicles, renewable energy products and other fast-charging and/or wireless applications.\n\nBut the semiconductor slowdown weighed heavily on Wolfspeed, which saw its losses grow last year. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Dec. 31, 2023, Wolfspeed brought in $208.4 million in revenue, an improvement from $173.8 million a year ago. However, the net loss for the quarter was $144.7 million, more than the $90.9 million Wolfspeed lost in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nWolfspeed projects third-quarter revenue between $185 million and $215 million, with losses between $134 million and $155 million. Thus, there will be no improvement, at least in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nWOLF stock is down 56% in the last year and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMaxLinear (MXL) A hand holding a phone that shows the MaxLinear (MXL) logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nMaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) makes analog, digital and mixed-signal circuits, as well as wire and wireless infrastructure.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 continued MaxLinear’s downward spiral. Revenue was $125.3 million, down from $290.5 million a year ago. The company posted a loss of $38.5 million and 47 cents per share versus a profit of $31.1 million and 40 cents per share a year ago.\n\nThe company is also now in arbitration with Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) for backing out of its proposed $4 billion acquisition. Silicon Motion is seeking $160 million as a termination fee plus other damages, interests and costs.\n\nMXL stock is one to avoid. It’s down 45% in the last year and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAmkor Technology (AMKR) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) doesn’t make semiconductors but is a semiconductor stock because it relies directly on the product. And that’s why it’s hurting this year.\n\nAmkor packages and tests integrated circuits for semiconductor chip manufacturers. The completed chips are used in smartphones, tablets, electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\n\nBut since those businesses haven’t made as many semiconductors lately, Amkor hasn’t been packaging and testing as many. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, down from $1.8 billion a year ago. Amkor made $6.5 billion in revenue for the full year, down from $7.1 billion in 2022.\n\nAmkor stock shows some life; the stock is up 30% in the last 12 months although it’s slipped 6% since January 1. It’s still not a good bet, though, and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor (AOSL) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlpha and Omega Semiconductor (NASDAQ:AOSL) makes semiconductors used in products such as flat-panel televisions, LED lighting, smartphones, battery packs, computer equipment and telecommunications equipment.\n\nThe company recently received some good news when it announced that the Department of Justice closed a criminal investigation concerning business transactions the company had with Chinese hardware company Huawei Technologies and brought no charges.\n\nThe probe began in 2019 after the Department of Commerce ordered Alpha and Omega to suspend shipments of products to Huawei. The Justice Department’s probe involved Alpha and Omega’s compliance with export control regulations, but the Commerce Department’s civil investigation continues.\n\nWhen you add the Huawei issue to an already challenging environment for semiconductor stocks, you can see why AOSL is a troubled stock.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Dec. 31, 2023) was $165.3 million, down from $188.8 million a year ago. The company posted a loss of $2.9 million and 10 cents per share, a year after posting a profit of $6.3 million and a gain of 21 cents per share.\n\nAOSL stock is down 12% in the last year and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSkyWater Technology (SKYT) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSkyWater Technology (NASDAQ:SKYT) is a Minnesota semiconductor engineering and fabrication company. Its products are used for aerospace and defense products, consumer, automotive, industrial and healthcare applications.\n\nSkyWater is the only U.S.-owned pure play silicon foundry. That may give it an advantage for companies that want to use American manufacturers.\n\nBut that really doesn’t help when the entire semiconductor industry is seeing a slowdown no matter where your plant may be located.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $13.8 million, down 19% from a year ago. The company posted a net loss of $1.1 million and 2 cents per share, versus a loss of $1.5 million and 3 cents per share a year ago.\n\nSKYT stock is down 8% in the last year. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nShoals Technology (SHLS) solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.\n\nSource: chuyuss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShoals Technology (NASDAQ:SHLS) is in the solar energy business. The company provides electrical balance of systems (EBOS) solutions for the infrastructure of solar, storage, and electric vehicle charging.\n\nIt works with solar factories around the world and helps produce 62 gigawatts of solar power. A few years ago, Shoals and other solar companies would have been considered good investments.\n\nBut not today. Labor costs, regulatory changes and higher interest rates crippled the industry last year. Solar isn’t the hot commodity it used to be, and that’s reflected in Shoals’ performance.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was actually up — $130.4 million versus $94.6 million a year ago. But net income was only $16.5 million, for earnings per share of 10 cents. For the full year, earnings were only 24 cents per share.\n\nSHLS stock is down 41% in the last 12 months; it has a long way to go to regain its former glory. It get an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a California-based semiconductor manufacturer that operates amplifiers, audio devices, clocks, modems, switches, televisions and more.\n\nThe company’s products can be used in smartphones, data centers, automobiles, and healthcare devices.\n\nThe company depends heavily on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which provides components for its desktop computers, notebooks, smartphones, watches, and tablets. While this has been a good source of revenue, it also makes Skyworks vulnerable should Apple turn to another supplier or start making its own parts.\n\nApple has also struggled recently with iPhone sales, particularly in China. Lowered demand for Apple’s products eats directly into Skyworks’ bottom line.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included revenue of $1.2 billion, down from $1.32 billion a year ago. Income of $231.3 million was a drop from $309.4 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nSWKS stock is down 8% in the last year.

        "title": "How Much Longer Will Warren Buffett Top Dividend Stocks Apple, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Underperform the S&amp;P 500?",
        "content": "It's no secret that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) top public equity position is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -- which has been the second worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock year to date (YTD), behind only Tesla.\n\nBut what you may not know is that other top Buffett stocks, like Chevron(NYSE: CVX) and Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), are also underperforming YTD.\n\nCombined, these three companies make up a staggering 54.8% of Berkshire's public equity portfolio. Here's why each dividend stock is underperforming the S&P 500 and what it can do to turn things around. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple is moving toward value stock territory\n\nLee Samaha(Apple): This year's hot investing words are \"artificial intelligence,\" and Apple's stock may have fallen out of favor due to its relative lack of exposure to the theme. Still, value investors won't care much about that, as the stock's 10% decline in 2024 is moving it into value territory.\n\nWhile there are concerns over slowing smartphone sales growth, not least in China, and Apple's year-over-year growth in product sales was minimal in the first quarter of its financial 2024, the long-term value case for the stock is based on its higher-margin services growth.\n\nIn Q1 2019, Apple's revenue share from services was just 13.8%, but that's up to 19.3% in the recently reported fourth quarter. That increase comes down to an 82% rise in services sales, compared to just 22% for products.\n\nGiven that Apple's services come with roughly double the gross profit margin of its products (around 70%, compared to mid-35% for products), Apple's gross profit margin increased from 38.4% to 45.9% over the period outlined above.\n\nThe increase highlights the value case for the stock -- long-term margin expansion from growing services revenue on the back of expanding its installed base of products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That installed base stands at 2.2 billion devices , and its paid subscriptions grew at a double-digit rate in its recently reported quarter. As such, Apple looks set for excellent long-term sales growth with margin expansion leading to earnings and cash flow growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple only has a 0.6% dividend yield, but it has raised its dividend every year since 2013.\n\nBecause it is such a massive company, Apple pays the second most dividends of any U.S.-based company, ahead of ExxonMobil and behind only Microsoft.\n\nTrading on 24.7 times its estimated free cash flow in 2024, Apple is not a screaming value stock. But if the market keeps selling the stock off, then value investors will eventually step in.\n\nPower your portfolio with Chevron stock while it is on sale\n\nScott Levine (Chevron): It's been a rough road for Chevron stock over the past year. While the S&P 500 has soared almost 34%, shares of Chevron have headed in the other direction, sinking almost 2%. Savvy investors know that sometimes when the market punishes a stock, it provides a great buying opportunity -- an insight that value investors understand well. This is clearly the case with Chevron. While shares may be out of favor now, those who are patient can pick up a quality stock at a discount. Plus, they can get paid while they wait for the stock to rebound, thanks to its forward dividend yield of 4.2%.\n\nCurrently, shares of Chevron are sitting in the bargain bin. Priced at 7.5 times operating cash flow, Chevron stock is trading at a discount to its five-year average cash flow valuation of 8.4. Prefer the price-to-earnings ratio? No problem. The stock still seems inexpensive, trading at 13.6 times trailing earnings, while its five-year average P/E is 14.7.\n\nThere are a few reasons why forward-looking investors will want to gas up on Chevron stock now. For one, management is taking a judicious approach to the payout. Over the past three years, Chevron's payout ratio has averaged a conservative 49.8%. Chevron is also developing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian, where it expects production to grow 10% in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nWhile the price of oil has ebbed from when West Texas Intermediate, the North American oil benchmark, was trading over $100 per barrel in 2022, it has been rising lately, which may give Chevron stock a boost. Even if it doesn't, though, Chevron stock is a smart way to generate strong passive income -- a strategy of which the Oracle of Omaha is well aware.\n\nA passive income powerhouse for risk-averse investors\n\nDaniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): Coke will generally underperform in a growth-led bull market and outperform during a bear market. Here's how the stock stacks up to the S&P 500 since 2020.\n\nCompany/Index 2024 (YTD as of March 15) 2023 2022 2021 2020 Coca-Cola 1.6% (7.4%) 7.4% 8% (0.9%) S&P 500 7.3% 24.2% (19.4%) 26.9% 16.3%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nGranted, these returns don't factor in dividends. But still, Coke has underperformed the market, which is expected because the market has done so well over the period.\n\nHowever, when growth stocks collapsed in 2022, and the market had a terrible year, Coke came through big time and outperformed the index by 26 percentage points.\n\nThe best way to invest in Coke isn't to try to beat the market, but to collect a steady stream of passive income from a reliable company. With limited ways to expand the business beyond strategic mergers and acquisitions -- which Coke has done an excellent job of over the last few years -- it's pretty much impossible for the company to keep pace with a growth-fueled market.\n\nHowever, there are signs that Coke is becoming a higher-quality company. Its price raises were a massive success as the company navigated supply chain constraints and offset inflationary effects. Its operating margin is over 28.3%, which is impressively high. For context, Apple's operating margin is 30.8%.\n\nThe main reason why Berkshire has held Coke for over 30 years is because of the company's growing dividend and buybacks, which reward shareholders without the need to sell stock.\n\nWith a yield of 3.2% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.2, Coke isn't that expensive, and it yields more than double the S&P 500.\n\nCoke is a perfect fit for investors who are focused on capital preservation instead of capital appreciation, are looking to supplement income in retirement, or are risk-averse. Expect Coke to continue underperforming a growth-led market, but to outperform if the narrative flips.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $1 Million (or More)",
        "content": "Are you thinking big? Like, really big? That is to say, are you looking to turn a tiny amount of money now into a seven-figure stash later?\n\nNever say never. Not only is it possible, it happens more often than you might think. The key is time and picking the right stock, of course, and then remaining patient enough to continue holding that ticker through the rough patches.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a look at three familiar stocks that turned a $1,000 investment into $1 million, if not more. Just be sure to read through the wrap-up that explains what you can learn from these three enormous winners to repeat the feat in the future.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't just a familiar modern-era winner. It's arguably the market's most memorable winner of all time! Shares are up more than 230,000% just since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO) at a split-adjusted price of $0.075. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth around $2.3 million today. That growth has also made Amazon one of the world's biggest companies, as measured by market cap.\n\nIt's not exactly a secret as to how it happened. Founder and longtime CEO Jeff Bezos saw an opportunity in the internet's infancy, viewing it as a convenience-providing platform where people would eventually do a great deal of their shopping. And he was right. The e-commerce giant alone accounts for over one-third of the United States' total e-commerce sales. That's bigger than the next nine e-commerce platforms combined.\n\nIt's not just an e-commerce giant anymore, though. It's also a cloud computing powerhouse. Amazon Web Services generated $90.8 billion worth of business last year, turning $24.6 billion of that revenue into operating profit. This arm now makes up roughly two-thirds of the company's entire bottom line. And again, it's a business built from scratch simply because Jeff Bezos saw a budding opportunity and acted.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Procter & Gamble\n\nTech-driven growth isn't the only path to riches, however. Consumer staples can do the job, too. Take Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) as an example. It, too, has made plenty of millionaires out of relatively small investors.\n\nOK, there are a couple of important footnotes to add here. One of them is that it's taken Procter & Gamble a lot longer to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million ... several decades longer, to be clear. Second, reaching this seven-figure mark with P&G would have required reinvesting its dividends into more shares of the stock.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race, though.\n\nOf course, Procter & Gamble also had an unfair competitive advantage. It's owned market-leading brands ranging from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste to Dawn dishwashing liquid for the decades in question. Not only is it easier to maintain a lead you already own, but being a market leader also provides leverage when it comes to keeping competitors in check and distribution partners in tow.\n\nRegardless of the reason, P&G has paid off for patient investors.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, technology giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has also minted many patient millionaires. The stock's present price of $175 is nearly 175,000% above its split-adjusted IPO price of $0.10 per share. A $1,000 investment in its 1980 IPO would now be worth just under $1.8 million.\n\nGranted, Apple's not been a red-hot winner for its entire existence. The company very nearly went bankrupt back in the late 1990s. It required a $150 million cash infusion from Microsoft and the rehiring of Steve Jobs as CEO to turn things around. And even then, things remained a little wobbly for years; the dot-com meltdown of 2000 certainly didn't help matters either. Apple shares didn't make any net progress during this turbulent time.\n\nRather, the bulk of the stock's enormous gain has taken shape since 2007, when the very first iPhone was released. It's not a stretch to suggest this incredibly popular smartphone, in fact, is the crux of the reason for the stock's incredible gains.\n\nWhatever the cause, congratulations to the people who understood what a game-changer the iPhone would end up being. It's not just the mobile phone all other phone makers are hoping to compete with. It mainstreamed the very idea of carrying around a web-connected mini-computer in your pocket.\n\n3 key takeaways for investors\n\nThe bad news is it's unlikely any of these three stocks can repeat the feat in the same amount of time they first turned $1,000 into $1 million (or more). All three companies are still outstanding. But circumstances were different when each stock began its heroic run-up.\n\nThe good news is, however, that the reasons Apple, Amazon, and P&G shares performed so well for so long are clear. Lots of other companies behind stocks that haven't yet dished such rallies exhibit these same qualities or soon will if they don't yet. Three of these attributes stand out above the rest.\n\nOne of these characteristics is a clear competitive advantage. For P&G, it was sheer size, which also ended up being the case for Amazon. For Apple, its edge was a superior product that other manufacturers would often imitate but would never successfully duplicate. Apple also benefited from the fact that it enjoyed complete control of the underlying digital ecosystem -- iOS, the App Store, and more -- that made its devices so functional.\n\nAnother somewhat related quality of these companies' businesses and core products is that each was and is future-proof. It's an overused example, but it still makes the point perfectly ... it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to circumvent the need for camera film, developing technology and at-home tools that could do the job just as well.\n\nConversely, the companies behind high-performance stocks aren't in jeopardy of becoming obsolete. Consumers will perpetually want newer, more powerful tech and will always want to shop. They'll also need to wash their clothes or brush their teeth. That's why you should be looking for companies that will remain relevant forever.\n\nFinally, bear in mind that at least two of these three companies -- Amazon and Apple -- seemed a little out of the ordinary at the time their stocks were getting started on their big gains. We now know they weren't odd, however. These companies were just ahead of their time. The market's next enormous winners will likely look similarly odd. Just look a the bigger picture, considering how consumers and corporations will see their solutions 10 and 20 years into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the AI movement\n\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\n\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\n\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\n\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander piled into the \"Magnificent Seven\" of AI stocks\n\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\n\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass added shares of time-tested AI businesses that would be AI-bubble resistant\n\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\n\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\n\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen gobbled up AI ancillary stocks in place of Nvidia\n\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\n\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\n\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\n\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\n\nMoreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as \"very important,\" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\n\nCompanies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced \"new collar\" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)  maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.\n\nFurthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.\n\nAnother observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates. To read about unemployment rates, see the countries with the highest unemployment rates. 12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College\n\nA student concentrate on their laptop in the library, taking advantage of an educational program online.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best alternatives to a 4-year college degree, we have looked at alternatives with 4 major traits. Firstly, we tried to include options that offered specialized training or are specific in nature. Secondly, we identified options that provided hand-on experience. Thirdly, we looked at degree alternatives that were largely accessible. Lastly, we selected alternatives that aligned with current industry demands and trends and hence, came with high employability chances. We tried to score each alternative out of a total of 40 on the basis of consensus about the presence of these traits. We utilized Reddit as our primary source of consensus. The list is presented in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Volunteer Work at Non Profit Organizations\n\nIM Score: 20\n\nVolunteer work at non-profit organizations offers practical, hands-on experience in real-world settings, fostering valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Unlike a four-year college degree, volunteering provides immediate engagement with societal issues, promoting empathy and social responsibility. It allows individuals to explore different career paths, gain insights into various industries, and network with professionals. Additionally, volunteering can lead to job opportunities and personal fulfillment without the financial burden of college tuition. It can also lead to inner sense of purpose and happiness. To read more about such jobs, see the happiest jobs in the world.\n\nVolunteering is also a great option if you are struggling to find a direction. It is also one of the best alternatives for college dropouts.\n\n11. Get an Associate Degree at a Community College\n\nIM Score: 21\n\nGetting an Associate Degree at a Community College offers several advantages over a 4-year college degree. Firstly, it's typically more affordable, allowing students to save money on tuition and fees. Additionally, community colleges often offer flexible schedules, making it easier for students to work while attending school or to balance other responsibilities. The smaller class sizes can provide more personalized attention and support. Associate degrees can also lead to some of the highest paying jobs as well.\n\n10. Start Freelancing\n\nIM Score: 22\n\nFreelancing offers flexibility, autonomy, and potentially higher income without the time and financial commitments of a four-year college degree. It allows individuals to capitalize on their skills immediately, gaining practical experience while networking and building a portfolio. Additionally, freelancing offers the opportunity to work on diverse projects, fostering continuous learning and skill development. With the rise of remote work and digital platforms, freelancers can access global opportunities, transcending geographical limitations. In exceptional cases, it is one of the easiest and high paying alternatives to a 4 year college degree.\n\n9. Get an Internship or an Entry Level Job\n\nIM Score: 24\n\nThis is one of the best options other than college after high school as choosing to pursue an internship or an entry-level job over a 4-year college degree can offer several advantages. The real-world experience can often be more immediately applicable to a career path than theoretical learning in a college setting. To read more about this, see the highest paying entry level jobs with no experience.\n\n8.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 8 best AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying. If you want to skip our discussion about smart trackers, go to the 3 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying.\n\nSmart Bluetooth Trackers like Apple's AirTags are emerging as pivotal components in an era of technological advancements. The market is expected to experience an impressive cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. It was valued at $583 million in 2021 and is expected to reach a market size of $1,655 million by 2030.\n\nIt is worth noting that smart trackers are a part of the much larger Internet of Things (IoT) market. The IoT market, as a whole, is experiencing even higher growth and is expected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. Its growth is driven by automation, big data demand, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\n\nSome of the factors influencing the growth of smart trackers include the rising number of smartphone owners. However, growth will be primarily driven by high-end phone users such as those of Apple's iPhones and Samsung's flagship phones.\n\nAirTag was launched with the motive of preventing the stealing and misplacing of iPhones. It was introduced as an accessory that works with Apple's Find My app to help users keep track of and find things that are important to them. However, users have found various uses for AirTags and other Bluetooth smart trackers, including pet surveillance.\n\nWhile the smart tracker market is on a trajectory of growth, it has significant challenges ahead of it. There are concerns over privacy, data security, and technological obsolescence. A host of legal issues are being raised, which might shift the regulatory environment against them. More recently, an attempted class action lawsuit against Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is being allowed to proceed because the judge was convinced that there are negligence issues surrounding the AirTags trackers. However, since leading tech companies have already invested quite alot in their smart trackers, they are ready to take proactive measures and innovations to address these challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevices like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags epitomize the fusion of innovation and utility. These Bluetooth smart trackers employ an array of technologies, including GPS, WiFi, RFID, and cellular networks to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring and location tracking.\n\nCurrently, the market is headed towards improving the ecosystem and app enhancement. Companies opening in the industry are building comprehensive ecosystems around their tracking devices, which go a mile or two beyond basic tracking. Creating and implementing a perfect ecosystem often involves the use of numerous technologies, including geofencing capabilities, crowd-sourced location tracking, and integration with other smartphone and IoT devices.\n\nOther trends prevalent in the market include a multi-technology approach and a focus on power efficiency and battery life. Most smart trackers today combine GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFI to ensure robust and efficient tracking solutions. In addition, manufacturers are now prioritizing extended battery life through efficient designs and optimized usage patterns.\n\nSome of the key players in the market include Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL), Tile, and Samsung. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags leads the market and are still the most popular type of tracking device. However, these can only be used with iPhones, which is why it is worth having a look at the best AirTag alternatives if you are an Android user. Tille is another prominent company that specializes in Bluetooth trackers for personal belongings. On the other hand, Samsung leverages its global presence to offer diverse smart tracking solutions.\n\nBefore diving into the list of the best AirTag alternatives, it is worth knowing how smart trackers and AirTag work. These trackers utilize a blend of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) to track personal belongings. In the case of AirTag, it sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that nearby devices can detect within the Find My network. These devices then send the location of AirTag into the owner's iCloud. While this is a smart approach, it also has a drawback as an AirTag needs an iPhone nearby to function.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying.  8 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 8 best AppleAirtag alternatives that are actually worth buying, we devised an original methodology. First, we went to online forums to understand what people actually want in their smart trackers, and we boiled it down to the following factors: battery life, Bluetooth tracking range, affordability, and protection. After looking at several smart trackers and their features, we devised a point system.\n\nFor battery life, we awarded 2 points to trackers that last a couple of days, 4 points to those that last a couple of weeks, and 5 points to those that last more than a month. For tracking range, we awarded 2 points for 10 meters or less, 3 points for 11 meters to 60 meters, 4 points for 61 to 100 meters, and 5 points for more than 100 meters range. For affordability, we awarded 3 points to trackers that cost more than $40, 4 points to those that cost less than $40 but more than $25, and 5 points to those that cost less than $25. For protection, we awarded 2 points to those that came with no protection, 3 points to weather resistant, 4 points to water resistant, and 5 points to waterproof trackers. Then, for each tracker, we summed the total and averaged it to arrive at the Insider Monkey Rating. The higher this rating, the higher the tracker ranked on our list.\n\nAs tie breakers, we used tracking range, battery life, and affordability in order. For all the points awarded, we tried to refer to user experience rather than the company's claim. It is worth noting that one of the trackers in our list is a pet collar, which we included because AirTags are sometimes used for pet surveillance.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n8 - Chipolo ONE Spot\n\nBattery Life - 5\n\nTracking Range - 3\n\nAffordability - 4\n\nProtection - 4\n\nInsider Monkey Rating - 4\n\nChipolo ONE Spot is one of the best Apple AirTag alternatives for iPhone users, as it works exclusively with Apple's Find My app. The battery is replaceable and lasts for up to one year. The device has a tracking range of up to 60 meters. Its price is comparable to the Apple Airtag as one Chipolo ONE spot retails for around $29. The tracker features a compact design with a built-in key ring hole, which makes attaching it to keys quite easy.\n\n7 - Cube Shadow\n\nBattery Life - 5\n\nTracking Range - 3\n\nAffordability - 4\n\nProtection - 5\n\nInsider Monkey Rating - 4.3\n\nCube Shadow is 7th on our list of the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying. It has a thin design, making it ideal for attaching to small items like wallets or keys. The device emits a ringtone that is audible within a reasonable range, helping users locate their belongings. The device comes with a tracking range of up to 200 feet, which is comparable to AirTags. One of the best things about the tracker is that it comes with a rechargeable battery, which lasts for up to sixty days on a single charge.\n\n6 - Tile Mate Bluetooth Tracker\n\nBattery Life - 5\n\nTracking Range - 3\n\nAffordability - 5\n\nProtection - 4\n\nInsider Monkey Rating - 4.3\n\nTile Mate Bluetooth Tracker is one of the most affordable trackers you can find. It is a simple yet efficient Bluetooth tracking device that makes it easy to find essential items such as keys and wallets. It offers two-way tracking functionality as the users can ring the tracker from their phones or ring their phones from the tracker. The tracker offers a 200-foot tracking range and emits a ringtone that is audible through obstacles such as walls or thick clothing.\n\n5 - Tile Pro\n\nBattery Life - 5\n\nTracking Range - 4\n\nAffordability - 4\n\nProtection - 4\n\nInsider Monkey Rating - 4.3\n\nTile Pro is fifth on our list of the 8 best Apple Airtag alternatives that are actually worth buying. It is priced higher than the Tile Mate Bluetooth Tracker, which is why this one scores 4 in affordability. However, with the extra money comes additional range, which is why this one is ranked higher on our list. This tracker has a range of 400 feet, double that of the more affordable version. In addition, it is also capable of producing louder volumes compared to the Tile Mate.\n\n4 - Eufy Security SmartTrack Link\n\nBattery Life - 5\n\nTracking Range - 4\n\nAffordability - 5\n\nProtection - 4\n\nInsider Monkey Rating - 4.5\n\nEufy Security SmartTrack Link is 4th on our list of the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk's X and Match Group on Wednesday joined \"Fortnite\" video game maker Epic Games' protest that Apple has failed to honor a court-ordered injunction governing payments in its lucrative App Store.\n\nThe technology companies, which developed some of the most popular apps in the App Store, said Apple was in \"clear violation\" of the Sept. 2021 injunction by making it difficult to steer consumers to cheaper means to pay for digital content.\n\nApple declined to comment specifically on the accusation, which was contained in a filing with the Oakland, California federal court.\n\nIt referred to its Jan. 16 statement that it had fully complied with the injunction, which it said would protect consumers and \"the integrity of Apple's ecosystem\" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride.\n\nEpic had sued Apple in 2020, saying it violated antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through the App Store and charging developers up to 30% commissions on purchases.\n\nThe injunction required Apple to let developers provide links and buttons to direct consumers to alternative payment options.\n\nLast week, Epic demanded that Apple be held in contempt, saying new rules and a new 27% fee on developers made the links effectively useless.\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the technology companies said Apple's conduct \"for all practical purposes\" entrenches anti-steering rules that the court found illegal, propping up Apple's \"excessive\" commissions and harming consumers and developers.\n\n\"Apple's restrictions on where and how developers can communicate with their users about their options for purchasing in-app content create significant barriers to competition and artificially inflate prices,\" the filing said.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Apple's appeal from the injunction. It also decided against hearing Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing. The company is based in Cupertino, California, while Epic is based in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nThe case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google added a new Transit feature to Google Maps for Wear OS, offering users public transit directions.\r\n\r\nNotably, this Transit option for location searches works with Wear OS Tile for quick travel, providing an ETA after driving, walking and biking.\r\n\r\nFurther, users can access a live map view, zoomed-out map view and exit icon on the watch face when selecting a route in Google Maps.\r\n\r\nThe latest move will likely boost the adoption of Wear OS. Moreover, the company is expected to gain solid traction across smartwatch users on the back of this new feature.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will enable Alphabet to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global smartwatch market. Per an EMR report, the global smartwatch market is expected to be valued at $160.67 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 15.6% between 2024 and 2032.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle Maps in Focus\n\nApart from the latest feature for Wear OS, the company also announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map. This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.\r\n\r\nFurther, Google added \"glanceable directions\" for Maps on Android and iOS, providing live ETAs and directions on the device's lock screen, using regular system notifications.\r\n\r\nThe company has also updated Google Maps on Android Auto to display estimated drive time in a bolder font, similar to other platforms. The bolder number, now displayed alongside thinner minutes and hour indicators, is available in version 11.119.0100 of Google Maps and version 11.5 of Android Auto.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital map market. Per a Future Market Insights report, the global digital map market is expected to reach $73.1 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2033.\r\n\r\nMoreover, growing Google Maps efforts will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.48 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nStrengthening Google Maps offerings will aid Alphabet to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which have positioned themselves well in the digital map space.\r\n\r\nApple is riding on the success of its Apple Maps offerings.\r\n\r\nApple’s launch of Apple Business Connect, a free tool enabling businesses to manage their location place cards and customize information for over a billion users on Apple Maps, including adding photos, logos and promotions, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is enjoying the growing momentum of Bing Maps with new feature updates.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft introduced live traffic updates on Bing Maps, enabling users to plan their journeys more efficiently by providing real-time information about traffic conditions during commutes.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "Google becomes the first AI company to be fined over training data",
        "content": "Nearly five years ago, I reported on how France’s news publishers had gone to war with Google over the issue of “ancillary copyright” fees—payments for including snippets of article text in Google’s search results. I wrote that the media houses were unlikely to win. Well, they just did. And as with everything else these days, AI suddenly became part of the equation.\n\nThis morning, the French competition authority fined Google €250 million ($271 million) for failing to comply with commitments it made a couple years ago regarding how it would negotiate the fees with the French news outlets. Google already received a €500 million fine over the matter in 2021. It’s not arguing back this time, which has probably spared it an even higher fine.\n\nI’m not going to go into the details of the revised negotiation process to which Google has agreed—it’s as dull as it sounds and, if you really want to dive in, here’s Google’s statement in French and English. The interesting part of this episode is about Google’s Bard AI, which these days goes by the name of Gemini.\n\nAs far as I’m aware, this is the first fine to be levied on an AI company at least partially because of its free-wheeling incorporation of everything it can grab into its training data.\n\nAccording to the French Competition Authority (FCA) the fine takes account of the fact that Google “used content from press agencies and publishers to train its [Bard] foundation model, without notifying either them or the [FCA].”\n\nAs Google tells it, the FCA “does not challenge the way web content is used to improve newer products like generative AI.” Google claimed this issue is “already addressed” in Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive, which provides an exception for text and data mining, and in the upcoming EU AI Act, which tells AI companies to respect the Copyright Directive (and to publish “sufficiently detailed” summaries of their training data).\n\nBut according to the FCA, the question of whether article-scraping AI companies qualify for that text and data mining exception “has not yet been settled.” It said Google had “at the very least” broken its commitment to be transparent in its commercial dealings with French news publishers, making this a fining matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, Google did recently launch a new control in the robots.txt file that web publishers use to send signals to Google’s web crawlers. The setting is called Google-Extended, and it’s supposed to let publishers opt out of having their data become Bard/Gemini training fodder without also having their articles disappear from Google Search and Google News.\n\nBut it only added that control at the end of September, more than two months after Bard’s European launch. During that period, French publishers effectively had to allow the unrestricted hoovering of their output into Bard if they also wanted it to appear in Search and News—which, remember, is how they then get to claim ancillary copyright fees from Google. That broke another of Google’s commitments, again contributing to today’s fine. The FCA also told Google to explain to publishers how the opt-out mechanism works.\n\nSo in summary, Google’s new control for publishers has belatedly fixed one of the issues with the unpaid incorporation of news articles into its AI training material, but the overall legality of this practice under EU copyright law remains an open question. It’s not hard to see why Google's big rival, OpenAI, has started cutting licensing deals with European press publishers like Axel Springer and Le Monde.\n\nOne final note while we’re on the subject of Big Tech and European antitrust regulators: Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition chief, just told Reuters that Apple may face a probe over the €0.50-per-app-installation “core technology fee” it’s levying on developers who dare to use the third-party iOS app stores that Apple must allow under the new EU Digital Markets Act. “There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA,” she said.\n\nGiven that Microsoft and Meta have both complained to Vestager that the fee makes third-party app stores unviable, there’s a storm a-coming, and I do not hate to say I told you so. More news below—and by the way, the Data Sheet team offers our red-cheeked apologies for misspelling “Nvidia” in yesterday’s email subject line…\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 as AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite Neighborhood Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM’s 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n“IBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,” said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm’s cash flow generation and “healthy” dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.\n\nMuch of the year’s advance followed IBM’s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.\n\nThe stock’s surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM’s 82% gain over the same period.\n\nWall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM’s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.\n\nThat hasn’t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM’s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company’s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“The CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “We can easily do better elsewhere.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories. The S&P 500 tech sector index, which tracks large-cap tech stocks, is up 12% in 2024. However, an index of mid-cap tech has done best of all, with a gain of 14%.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co. after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year, people familiar with the matter said. The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry. Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion in 2024, mollifying investors concerned about a gradual dissipation of growth during a Chinese economic downturn. Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea’s largest company. PocketHealth Inc. has raised $33 million from new investors including Deloitte Ventures and Samsung Next, joining a growing crop of startups gathering capital to explore the use of AI in healthcare.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nJinkoSolar Kingsoft Cloud Postmarket\n\nMicron\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion China’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers’ $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball—If He Wants To Julius Baer Hits Reboot to Escape Swiss Banking’s New Malaise Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq’s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company’s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA’s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC’s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company’s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n“AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.”\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).

Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Results were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet’s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.”\n\n8. First Solar, Inc.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management’s ability to deliver going forward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor’s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook arrived in China on Wednesday touting the country’s importance as a market and production base, reaching out to Chinese consumers who may be souring on the maker of iPhones.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite Neighborhood Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features US Weighs Sanctioning Huawei’s Secretive Chinese Chip Network\n\nThere’s no supply chain in the world more critical to the company than China’s, Cook told the Global Times in an interview tweeted by the newspaper. Apple’s been expanding its base in the country and increasing investment over the past 30 years, he added.\n\nCook’s comments, ahead of Thursday’s launch of Apple’s eighth store in Shanghai, come as the “symbiotic” relationship between the company and China as he once described is showing signs of fraying.\n\nAnchored by Foxconn, or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple’s manufacturing presence in China has been broad and unshakable for over two decades. But the company has suffered snags in production in recent years due to a US and China trade war and Covid-triggered factory closures, delaying launches of products.\n\nApple is now diversifying its operations away from China by working with assembly and component manufacturing partners in India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere.\n\nApple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to China: QuickTake\n\nRead More: Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge\n\nDemand for its products in China is also cooling.\n\nPhone sales plunged 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to research firm Counterpoint. Apple has been losing market share to US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co., which has benefited from a wave of patriotic buying for its homegrown Mate 60 Pro devices.\n\nThe upcoming Shanghai store adds to Apple’s biggest retail network outside the US and is part of a broader effort to grow and revitalize the company’s brick-and-mortar outlets. China remains a vital market for the company with the world’s largest smartphone consumer base and potential for growing sales of accessories like the Apple Watch.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s apparent vote of confidence for China is no less important to Xi Jinping’s government. With the economy slowing, new foreign direct investment falling and multinationals looking to other markets for growth, it’s important to show the world China is still open for business in the wake of regulatory crackdowns and national security concerns that have spooked foreign investors.\n\nCook posted a video of himself on walking around Shanghai with Chinese actor Zheng Kai. In a Weibo clip seen by half a million people within minutes of posting, Cook crossed a bridge near the historic Bund, sampled soup dumplings in a local restaurant and said “hello” in the Shanghainese dialect.\n\nBorn and raised in Shanghai, Zheng is one of China’s most famous TV and movie stars. He recently starred in Blossoms Shanghai, a TV show aired on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s video streaming service.\n\nRead More: Apple to Open New Shanghai Store as China iPhone Sales Slump\n\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan, Jessica Sui and Zheping Huang.\n\n(Updates with a revenue chart.

        "title": "Apple-Google Gemini Partnership Could Make an Unstoppable AI Force",
        "content": "Google’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), shot higher yesterday, finishing the day up 4.6%, following a Bloomberg report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to Google Gemini as the AI integrated into the iPhone. Indeed, a potential Apple-Google Gemini partnership in artificial intelligence (AI) could mirror their deal with search, which was the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny in recent years.\n\nAnd while a Google-Apple AI partnership is sure to draw the ire of antitrust regulators, I see the move as a potentially massive win for both companies as they seek to gain (further) in the AI race.\n\nWith Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the charge on generative AI with its OpenAI stake, Apple must find a way to make up for lost time on the AI front. Teaming up with Google is a way to catch up with industry leaders like Microsoft. Also, it may be a straightforward way to pull ahead as Apple gains access to one of the most potent large language models (LLMs), Google Gemini. Given this, I remain bullish on both AAPL and GOOGL.\n\nApple: Teaming Up with an AI Powerhouse Could Prove Wise\n\nWhile I’m sure Apple could incorporate its own LLM into its devices, I think Google is the better option at this early phase in the AI boom. Why? As good as LLMs have become in recent quarters, they’re still not immune from hallucinating (making stuff up, seemingly out of the blue).\n\nOnly time will tell when we have a robust, hallucination-free LLM ready for the market. Regardless, given Apple’s history of releasing polished products that are truly ready for takeoff, I just don’t see Apple putting itself out there with a work-in-progress type of LLM product.\n\nAs capable and impressive as they are, even the latest versions of Google Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo are technically works in progress, at least in my opinion.\n\nNeither LLM is perfect, especially at this point in the AI lifecycle, when hallucinations still happen regularly. My guess is it could take a while before LLMs are polished enough that mistakes become incredibly rare (or maybe virtually impossible).\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps we may be a few quarters or even a few years away from the error-free AI that many of us envision as a sort of holy grail in AI. Given how fast generative AI technologies are advancing (think exponential, not linear, rates), though, maybe hallucination-free LLMs are a heck of a lot closer than many of us may think.\n\nFor now, I think the masses have come to accept that the occasional hiccup is bound to happen when using even the best LLM that exists today. Users of such LLMs can simply check the sources themselves to ensure they’re not on the receiving end of a hallucination. Indeed, fact-checking can be a bit of a hassle when using LLMs like Gemini or GPT-4, but it’s a relatively small compromise. Further, it’s between that and using an old-fashioned search engine.\n\nWhat Could the Future Hold for the Google-Apple AI Partnership?\n\nI don’t think Apple has anything to really gain by rushing an LLM product to market right now, especially given that today’s LLMs are prone to errors, negative headlines, lawsuits, public outrage, and all sorts of negativity.\n\nWhen the perfect time comes (perhaps when LLMs have a bit more polish), though, I think Apple could have the option to replace Google Gemini with its own LLM, just like when it gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot from Mac devices when it was ready to launch on the back of its very own Apple Silicon.\n\nIn these early stages of the AI boom, Apple stands to benefit from all the positives of AI by using Gemini without having to deal with the downsides. If something goes awry, it’s the Gemini LLM, not Apple, that’s to blame. In the meantime, look for Alphabet to gain traction as Gemini introduces itself to Apple’s golden install base, which is billions of users strong.\n\nIndeed, Gemini in iPhone could ultimately help Google and Apple surpass Microsoft in the LLM race. It will be interesting to see how a potential Google-Apple partnership evolves. Nevertheless, if any deal is inked, I expect that GOOGL stock could face a considerable valuation multiple expansion, perhaps one closer to that of its top AI peer, MSFT stock, even if Alphabet is forced to pay Apple a hefty sum.\n\nEven after surging 4.6% in a day, GOOGL stock still seems to have room to run at just 25.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) if it’s to catch up to MSFT stock’s 37.7 times trailing P/E multiple.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAlphabet stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Alphabet stock price target of $165.09 implies 12.3% upside potential.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nApple stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target of $204.86 implies 16.3% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt seems like a Google-Apple Gemini AI deal would be a win for both firms in a bid to pull ahead in the generative AI race. It’s important to note, however, that all we have is a report from Bloomberg about potential talks between the two companies.\n\nThe chatter about the chatter means that nothing is set in stone yet, even though recent market action suggests a dotted line has already been signed. In any case, look for Apple to go on the hunt for an AI partner as it seeks a “backstop” in this still-early (and less-than-polished) stage of generative AI.\n\nDisclosure",

Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a semiconductor manufacturer, offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services. It is best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm.\n\nWhile earnings estimates are volatile, ranging from $1.08 to $1.37 billion, TSM regularly beats estimates. It currently has rating between “Strong Buy” and “Buy” on Yahoo! Finance. After a record-breaking 2022, TSM revenue slid in 2023, going down to $2.16 trillion. However, given the volatility in the semiconductor market due to shortages, this decrease is not to the company’s performance.\n\nThe semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2%. However, market volatility, supply/demand shocks and geopolitical tensions are factors that may cause this growth to stagnate. To combat this, TSM is diversifying its factories out of the East-Asia region and into relatively more stable countries like the U.S. Additionally, it is in talks with Foxconn, another semiconductor manufacturer, to build a factory in India.\n\nAs demand for semiconductors picks up, TSM’s value will too. Management’s decision to invest in future-proofing revenue streams shows foresight and proactivity, which are great precursors to growth. All this makes TSM a “Buy” stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A judge has denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that stalkers are using its AirTag devices to track victims — and that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent them.\n\nApple’s $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from their lost keys to wallets and luggage. But stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar products to follow individuals without their consent.\n\nIn December 2022, Apple was sued by dozens of plaintiffs who said they were stalked by AirTag users. They alleged that Apple failed to mitigate such dangers and should have done more to protect victims — claiming AirTags “revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking” and that current safety features are inadequate.\n\nApple attempted to dismiss the litigation in a filing last year, arguing the company “took proactive steps to try to deter misuse” and that it should not bear liability for injuries caused by third parties. But San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed that motion on Friday.\n\nChhabria ruled that, while most of the class-action plaintiffs' claims were “inadequately pled,\" three can proceed for negligence and strict product liability under California law. The remaining claims were dismissed in a separate order.\n\n“Apple may ultimately be right that California law did not require it to do more to diminish the ability of stalkers to use AirTags effectively, but that determination cannot be made at this early stage,\" Chhabria wrote.\n\nChhabria detailed arguments from both Apple and the plaintiffs in the ruling. Included were accounts from the three remaining claims of victims being stalked by former partners or others through AirTags that were allegedly attached to their cars, resulting in emotional and sometimes financial harm.\n\nAll three of these cases involve “purported defects” of AirTags that made it harder for the victims to both understand the tracking and quickly stop it, Friday's ruling outlines, including unclear or delayed notifications, as well as an inability to disable the devices remotely, which allegedly prolonged stalking.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’re grateful for the opportunity to continue this critical litigation,” Gillian L. Wade, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press via email. “Abusive and dangerous location tracking is only becoming more common, so it’s imperative to do everything we can to give voice to the victims, and to push for accountability and change.”\n\nApple and attorneys representing the California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nBack in February 2022, months ahead of the class action filing, Apple released a statement that said it “condemn(s) in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products.\" It also noted then-planned updates aimed at increasing safety.\n\nLast year, Apple also partnered with Google to submit a proposal aimed at setting standards for combatting secret surveillance on AirTags and similar gadgets.",

        "title": "I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.",
        "content": "The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst. Pets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.\n\nBut, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?\n\nThe S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?\n\nI don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term. The Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years? As we say in the part of the world in which I live: fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Users can disable these notifications in their preferences at any time.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors to enhance YouTube Music offerings will likely aid Alphabet to bolster its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth driver for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts will likely allow Alphabet to strengthen its competitive position against rivals like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN, which are also making substantial efforts to strengthen their footing in the global music streaming space.\r\n\r\nRecently, Apple offered USHER fans exclusive content on Apple Music ahead of his upcoming Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. The content includes a trailer, studio album discography, playlists curated by USHER and NFL teams, and dedicated Apple Music Radio programming for Apple Music subscribers.\r\n\r\nApple also launched a Discovery Station for Apple Music. The Discovery Station, available on Apple Music's mobile, desktop and web apps, is a curated selection of music based on users’ recent listening, which has not yet been added to the library.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is riding on the success of its music streaming service, Amazon Music.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Amazon Music Unlimited service offers an expanded catalog and over 1,000 spatial remixes for Dolby Atmos soundbars, Android and iOS devices, and Amazon Echo Studio.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "Wall Street’s Favorite Blue-Chip Stocks? 3 Tickers That Are Practically Money Machines",
        "content": "Investors look for equities with the potential for rapid returns in their pursuit of profitable investments. Several blue-chip stocks are expected to continue to perform well, providing a mix of both cash flow stability and long-term growth.\n\nThese top players in the field, who offer stability and growth, cover sectors ranging from digital technology to pharmaceuticals. Businesses with large user bases and leadership in digital payment get more growth through technology utilization and strategic relationships.\n\nEven with the market’s record highs and year-long rise, it’s getting harder to sniff out undervalued blue-chip stocks. High valuations carry a danger of sudden price dips. Still, certain undervalued blue chip stocks open doors to stability and reliable returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEvery investor should own these three blue chips and be open to great opportunities.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nWe once knew it to be the world’s most valuable company.\n\nHowever, since giving up its crown Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders may not need to worry. The company’s weak performance this year may be concerning, as revenue continues to decline despite still sky-high revenues. As analysis shows, it is noted that the price targets go from $158.00 to $250.00 with a $201.41 mean.\n\nHowever, light appears on the horizon for long-term investors. Recently, AAPL surged higher after the company reportedly bought Canadian AI startup DarwinAI. This deal highlights the company’s focus on this space, and that its AI initiatives are beginning to roll. In early 2024, Apple integrated the DarwinAI team, with Apple’s CEO hinting at future advancements in AI. This happened despite the company trailing behind rivals like Microsoft and Google.\n\nFurther, Apple dropped plans for electric cars and turned its attention toward generative AI, teasing a big AI reveal. Apple’s stock is still cheaper than competitors like Amazon and Tesla, with a healthy gross margin of about 45%, at 26-times forward profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become a top player in technology, especially in virtual reality (VR) stocks. Known for its Rift and Quest VR headsets, Meta’s Oculus divisions led immersive gaming experiences with a transition to the metaverse.\n\nThe rise of Reels brings out Meta Platforms’ rule on social media. Its ad impressions increased by 28% in 2023 year over year (YOY). Temu, owned by PDD in China, became Meta’s biggest advertiser, spending around $2 billion on ads. In light of Meta’s dividend buzz, the change shows PDD’s intention to expand Temu in the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, experts believe that fiscal 2024 revenue will surpass $158.2 billion, a 17.3% boost from the last year. Also, they anticipate 2025 sales to cross $178 billion. With a $528.80 price target, experts rank its shares a strong buy, putting Meta with the top dogs of VR stocks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffet’s $364 billion Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio, which includes Apple and other blue-chip stocks, continues to attract investors looking for stock inspiration. Apple controls 43% of the portfolio, and Buffet reaps the rewards from his initial 2016 investment. Additionally, this led to a 374% skyrocket in the stock by March 8.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, unlike IT firms solely focused on AI and data, has experienced growth thanks to its varied sectoral investments. Diversity locks in stability and facilitates strategic capital adjustments. And Buffet’s seasoned experience raises Berkshire’s appeal, providing a sanctuary during market volatility.\n\nThe company’s Q4 operating income grew 28% to $8.48 billion, boosted by a 28% increase in buybacks, expected to total $2.2 billion. Barron’s listed BRK-B with its top ten picks, believing after-tax operating products to shoot through $40 billion in 2024. I tend to agree that this is a stock worth owning for the long-term, among several reasons.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "This Is the Cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric",
        "content": "There's been a lot of talk about the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” Huang added in a press release.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNvidia has an 80% share of the data centre AI chip market and hopes to cement its dominance with this latest chip.\n\nThe company is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple is discussing a potential deal to integrate Google’s (GOOG) artificial intelligence platform Gemini into the iPhone, Bloomberg reported.\n\nApple is holding “active negotiations” to license Gemini’s AI models to integrate its generative AI features into an upcoming software update to the iPhone later this year.\n\nApple’s models could power on-device generative AI with iOS 18, releasing later this year, while cloud-based AI features like text- and image-generation could come via partnerships with the likes of Google.\n\n\"Given Apple's installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices, a licensing deal based on volume of usage could end up being a very significant cost for Apple but a fixed license for any cloud-based usage would not be economical for partners,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said.\n\n“An on-device fixed charge per device seems most likely but would be more limited in capabilities. Apple could also use this as an approach to speed up time to market, while continuing to develop in-house technologies,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnilever (ULVR.L)\n\nUnilever has warned that up to 7,500 jobs are at risk as the Magnum maker outlined plans to split off its ice cream unit as a separate business.\n\nThis overhaul is primarily aimed at saving around €800m (£684m) over the next three years. The plan will separate its ice cream businesses and divide the rest of Unilever into four divisions: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care and Nutrition.\n\nThe FTSE 100 consumer goods giant said it was accelerating its “growth action plan” which will make it a “simpler, more focused company”.\n\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Action is what shareholders wanted to see from the new team at the top, and that’s what’s been delivered today.\n\n“Ice cream always looked like the odd one out when you compare it to other product lines, and performance has struggled of late.\n\nRead more: AI could spark 'complete annihilation of humankind' unless regulated\n\n“It’s not a huge shock to see this move, but it’s something prior management wasn’t able to deliver.\n\n“Unilever’s not an overly expensive name at the minute so expect markets to react positively to the news, perhaps more due to the decisive action than anything else.”\n\nAccording to the group, any impacted staff members will be consulted about the job cuts but did not reveal whereabouts they will be made.\n\nAstrazeneca (AZN.L)\n\nAstraZeneca has acquired oncology biotech Fusion Pharmaceuticals for $2.4bn as part of a plan to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer treatments.\n\nCanadian biotech Fusion, whose shares trade in New York, is involved in radiopharmaceuticals, a rapidly growing area of cancer treatment that targets specific organs, tissues or cells within the human body.\n\n\"The acquisition marks a major step forward in AstraZeneca delivering on its ambition to transform cancer treatment and outcomes for patients by replacing traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments,\" said AstraZeneca.\n\nThe deal involves a $2bn upfront cash transaction, with a total transaction value of $2.4bn based on contingent, further payments. It follows AstraZeneca’s $1bn acquisition of a French rare diseases start-up Amolyt last week.\n\nWatch: Nvidia CEO Unveils Latest Powerful Chip at “AI Woodstock”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Companies are getting bolder in their battles to beat back proposals requiring them to disclose more about everything from environmental policies to AI, as shareholder support for governance changes shows new signs of waning in 2024.\n\nSo far this year, Apple (AAPL), Tyson Foods (TSN), and Applied Materials (AMAT) have defeated proposals that would have required the giants to disclose more about diversity, ESG, labor practices and AI policies.\n\nExxon (XOM) is suing two activist investor groups — Arjuna Capital and Follow This — after the organizations tried to bring a shareholder vote on whether the oil giant should disclose greenhouse gas emissions.

(Photo by MARK FELIX/AFP via Getty Images) (MARK FELIX via Getty Images)\n\nAnd the Securities and Exchange Commission watered down a new set of climate-risk disclosure rules after companies complained about the costs of compiling indirect emissions. The Chamber of Commerce last week filed a petition asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to block the rules the SEC did pass.\n\nThe bolder action by big businesses comes as political heat around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies mount in an election year.\n\nFormer President Trump has promised to banish ESG \"forever,\" while a top Trump ally has called DEI \"bigotry\" against white men.\n\nRepublican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.\n\nBig asset managers and Wall Street banks that own giant slugs of stock in major American companies are contributing to the retreat.\n\nThe latest retrenchment came last month when financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), State Street (STT), and Pimco all pulled out of Climate Action 100+, a coalition formed in 2017 to encourage companies to reduce their emissions.\n\nBlackRock (BLK), the world's largest money manager, also ended its US involvement with the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nDialing back\n\nA key test of these issues is taking place this spring, as companies collect votes on a variety of proposals seeking changes to corporate governance. So far this year, stockholders are saying 'no' to many of them.\n\nApple shareholders roundly rejected a collection of ethics- and employment-centered initiatives, turning down a labor-backed proposal from AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund (AFLCIX) that suggested the iPhone maker report how it uses AI technology in its business operations.\n\nOther failed initiatives pushed for Apple to report more detailed information on racial and gender pay gaps and the evenness of its application of human rights policies around the globe. The headquarter of Apple in Cupertino, Calif. Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nEven a proposal that sought to protect conservative views from discrimination lacked enough support to pass. It would have required Apple to disclose potential risks from its omission of \"viewpoint\" and \"ideology” discrimination in its employment policy.\n\nBig money managers that serve as the largest stockholders in big, publicly-traded companies are shying away from any proposals likely to be viewed as activism, according to Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar’s director of investment stewardship research.\n\nThat includes proposals both for and against ESG- and DEI-type policies.\n\n\"Certainly asset managers have dialed down their enthusiasm to back these kinds of proposals over the last few years,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe apparent swing in favor of less disclosure may be an indication that shareholders are growing tired of trying to influence corporate behavior.\n\n\"It’s still too early to tell,\" said Stewart, referring to whether this year will show a statistically significant shift.\n\nA new phase\n\nThere have been some other notable company victories so far in 2024.\n\nAt Tyson Foods, shareholders voted against a third-party audit to monitor its worker population while the meat producer faces claims its employment of minors violated US labor laws.\n\nAt Applied Materials, shareholders of the semiconductor materials manufacturer voted against proposals to report on quantitative median and adjusted pay gaps across race and gender.\n\nOne greenhouse gas emissions proposal has won shareholder approval so far this year, according to ISS-Corporate. That came at Jack In the Box (JACK), where 56% of shareholders voted to require disclosure of emission reduction targets. One ESG proposal that did win enough votes so far this year came at Jack In The Box, where 56% of shareholders voted to require disclosure of emission reduction targets. Photo: REUTERS/Mike Blake (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThere could be another explanation for the waning support: New reporting mandates from regulators and US exchanges are starting to satisfy investors.\n\nA lot of new rules have been passed this decade requiring more information from companies. In 2020, the SEC expanded human capital disclosure rules to require that companies disclose risks and resources associated with their employee headcount.\n\nThe next year in 2021, the SEC made it easier for investors to get climate change and social issues on corporate voting ballots while Nasdaq made it mandatory for listed companies to disclose diversity.\n\nStarting in 2025, the SEC's new climate rules will require companies to reveal their carbon footprint in an effort to help investors evaluate how climate change may impact businesses’ bottom line.\n\n\"Those regulations and standards are starting to hit,\" Stewart said, \"so I think [shareholders] are feeling less need to push quite so hard on them because there are actual requirements out there that are prompting companies to make those kinds of disclosures.\"\n\nNo matter the reason, overall support for ESG-focused resolutions is falling and will likely continue, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.\n\n\"I think we're entering a phase moving away from the investor activism side of things into a phase where there's written down regulations and standards,\" Stewart said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Have Collectively Repurchased $1.07 Trillion of Their Own Stock Since the Start of 2013",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following a challenging year in 2022, which saw all three major stock indexes plunge into respective bear markets, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite have all launched to new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nThere isn't just one factor that can be pointed to as the fuel for Wall Street's epic rally. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that includes a strong U.S. economy, better-than-expected corporate earnings, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a next-big-thing trend, and a historically robust level of share repurchase activity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough aggregate corporate share buybacks in 2023 fell from the record levels observed during the 2022 bear market, the $787.3 billion S&P 500 companies collectively spent on share repurchases on a trailing-12-month basis, as of Sept. 30, 2023, remains well above the historic average.\n\nThe reason public companies enact share repurchase programs is threefold:\n\nFor companies with steady or growing net income, a steady reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it can make a company appear more fundamentally attractive to investors. When a public company retires shares of its common stock, the ownership stakes of existing/long-term shareholders can increase over time. This encourages investors to have a long-term mindset. It's a way for a company's board of directors to demonstrate faith in a company's long-term growth strategy.\n\nWhile more than 56% of S&P 500 companies repurchased at least $5 million worth of their own stock during the September-ended quarter, there are a few companies that are step above the rest when it comes to buybacks.\n\nSince 2013, the following three widely owned companies have collectively repurchased $1.07 trillion worth of their own stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: $651 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nWhen it comes to share repurchases, it's fair to say that tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in a class of its own. Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, the company has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nTo put this into context, there are only eight companies in the S&P 500, excluding Apple, with a market cap above $651 billion. Apple could have comfortably purchased 491 of the other 499 S&P 500 companies with the amount of money it's spent buying back its stock.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons Apple has an abundance of cash to repurchase its stock. To start with, it's a trusted brand with an exceptionally loyal following. A survey conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 of more than 2,000 iPhone users found that nearly 92% had no intention of switching smartphone brands with their next purchase.\n\nInnovation is the other big reason Apple has been nothing short of a cash cow. Domestically, Apple's iPhone has accounted for 50% or more of smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable in 2020.\n\nHowever, Apple's future rests with innovation beyond the physical realm. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift toward subscription services. A subscription-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin, help smooth out some of the revenue lumpiness associated with physical product upgrade cycles, and can further enhance the benefits of the Apple product and service ecosystem.\n\nWhile reducing its outstanding share count by 41% since 2013 has provided a lift to Apple's EPS, investors should remain diligent about digging beneath the surface when analyzing the company's growth trends. For instance, even though Apple's adjusted EPS ticked higher by $0.02 per share in fiscal 2023 (ended in September), the company's net income fell by $2.8 billion to $97 billion for the year.\n\nFor the moment, Apple's buybacks are helping to partially mask a stalling of its growth engine. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet: $240 billion in share repurchases since 2015\n\nAnother S&P 500 component that's turned on the proverbial jets in the buyback department in recent years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, social media site YouTube, and autonomous driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nSince initiating a share repurchase program in 2015, Alphabet's stock buybacks have grown with each passing year. The $61.5 billion spent repurchasing its stock in 2023 increased its aggregate buybacks over roughly eight years to $240 billion. Alphabet has spent enough on buybacks that it could have purchased all but 28 companies within the S&P 500, not counting itself.\n\nIf you're wondering what's made Alphabet such a success for so long, look no further than its virtual monopoly, Google. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back almost nine years. It's the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target their message(s) to users. As a result, Google tends to enjoy premium ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nHowever, the lion's share of Alphabet's cash flow growth moving forward may well come from Google Cloud. As of the September-ended quarter, Google Cloud was the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, with an estimated 10% share of enterprise cloud spending. More importantly, this segment generated a full-year profit in 2023 after many years of losses. Cloud services tend to produce considerably higher margins than advertising.\n\nAs Alphabet's outstanding share count continues to shrink, the company's sales and net income are climbing. This is a recipe for EPS growth to outpace sales growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nMicrosoft: $183 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nThe third juggernaut that's been putting the pedal to the medal in the buyback department for more than a decade is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though I've arbitrarily cut off the start date at 2013, Microsoft has been repurchasing its stock for even longer than Apple. Since 2013, it's collectively retired around $183 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nNot including itself, Microsoft has spent more on buybacks since the beginning of 2013 than the market caps of all but 41 S&P 500 companies.\n\nMicrosoft's continued outperformance is a function of it seamlessly blending its legacy operations with a handful of high-growth initiatives. For example, it's no secret that the growth heyday for Windows and Office have long since passed. Nevertheless, Windows still holds a 72% share of desktop operating systems worldwide. This is an exceptionally high-margin segment that generates abundant cash flow, which allows Microsoft to aggressively invest in higher-growth initiatives.\n\nWith regard to \"high-growth initiatives,\" I'm primarily talking about cloud services and AI. Cloud infrastructure service platform Azure is the world's No. 2 provider in terms of enterprise spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and recently unveiled its Maia AI chip to help power its own Azure data centers. The cloud and AI can help Microsoft sustain a double-digit sales growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft also has what might be the most pristine balance sheet on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to receive the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Microsoft closed out calendar year 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's generated nearly $103 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash allows Microsoft to innovate, make acquisitions, buy back copious amounts of its own stock, and comfortably pay out the largest nominal-dollar dividend among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best dividend ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on dividend-paying companies, head over to 5 Best Dividend ETFs To Buy.\n\nReutersreported that global corporate dividends reached a record high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, largely due to substantial contributions from banks. According to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, nearly 86% of listed companies worldwide either increased or maintained their dividends. Projections from the same index indicate that dividend payouts are set to hit a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the leading dividend payer in 2023, followed closely by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The overall value of corporate dividends saw a 5% increase from 2022 to 2023, totaling $1.57 trillion. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, attributed this growth to robust corporate cash flow, driving dividends and share buybacks.\n\nMoreover, high interest rates boosted bank margins, resulting in a record $220 billion payout to shareholders in 2023. However, this positive trend was counteracted by significant dividend cuts in the mining sector, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Although the rapid ascent of bank dividends may decelerate, declines in the mining sector are expected to have a reduced impact. Despite challenges in specific sectors, diverse industries such as vehicles, utilities, software, food, and engineering demonstrated promising growth. Geographically, Europe (excluding the UK) and Japan played pivotal roles in global dividend growth, with Europe witnessing a 10.4% increase in payouts. The United States, while making a substantial contribution to global dividend growth owing to its size, reported a growth rate in line with the global average at 5.1%. Conversely, emerging markets observed stagnant dividends, with Brazil facing substantial cuts and China experiencing lackluster growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the rise in inflation, spurred by monetary easing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by steadily increasing interest rates throughout 2023. This move had significant ramifications, leading to heightened borrowing costs for companies amid escalating interest rates and inflationary pressures. S&P Global Market Intelligencereported that there was a notable 59% increase in the number of companies filing for bankruptcy in 2023, compared to the previous year, nearing levels observed during the pandemic's peak. However, the anticipated growth in regular dividends in the US market averages around 5.8%, aligning with the 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% since 2014. The energy sector leads variable dividends, driven by a shift towards performance-based shareholder return policies since 2019. In 2022, over 20 energy companies disbursed a record $20 billion in variable dividends, benefiting from elevated oil and gas prices. However, in 2023, companies favored share repurchases due to lower valuation. The size of variable dividends in 2024 will hinge on oil and gas price volatility, demand, and its impact on share prices. The five largest sectors collectively contribute nearly 40% of total dividends and 2.05% in the estimated 5.8% growth, with real estate mandated to distribute the majority of its earnings.\n\nLately, investors are showing renewed interest in dividend-paying stocks this year after a period of decline in 2023, despite robust returns in the US stock market. Last year, rising interest rates led investors to favor bonds over stocks with smaller payouts, while mega-cap tech stocks attracted attention due to artificial intelligence hype. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index saw a modest 5.7% increase compared to the broader S&P 500 total return index's 26% gain. However, with recent declines in yields and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, dividend stocks are gaining traction again. Analysts suggest that investors are seeking stable, higher-yielding dividends amidst ongoing market volatility, particularly during an easing cycle. Companies that raise their dividends often receive favorable attention from investors, as evidenced by recent examples such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), whose stock prices increased following dividend hikes and share buyback announcements. Historical data indicates that companies increasing dividends tend to outperform in the stock market, while those lowering dividends may face underperformance.\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks to buy include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

Established on November 8, 2005, it offers exposure to companies with both capital growth and dividend income characteristics. SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSE:SDY) is one of the best dividend ETFs to invest in.\n\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is the largest holding of SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSE:SDY). 3M is a global technology services provider operating through four segments – Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. On March 13, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stock surged 5% to a two-month high after CEO Mike Roman said he expects a higher first-quarter profit of as much as $2.20 per share, up from $2.15. This increase is due to interest earned on debt raised for the spinoff of Solventum as an independent healthcare company.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), compared to 54 funds in the last quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.65 million shares worth approximately $290 million.\n\nIn addition to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\n10. WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (NYSE:DON)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 31.35%\n\nWisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (NYSE:DON) ranks 10th on our list of the best dividend ETFs. WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (NYSE:DON) aims to mirror the performance of dividend-paying mid-cap companies in the US equity market. It offers investors exposure to a wide array of dividend-paying firms in this segment, catering to both growth potential and income objectives. As of March 14, 2024, the fund had total assets of $3.5 billion and an expense ratio of 0.38%. Established on June 16, 2006, it provides a distribution yield of 1.54% and a SEC 30-day yield of 2.37%.\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is the largest holding of WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (NYSE:DON). It is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company operating in the United States and the District of Columbia. On February 23, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) declared a $0.215 per share quarterly dividend, a 0.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.213. The dividend is payable on March 29, to shareholders on record as of March 20.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), compared to 52 funds in the last quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.60 million shares worth $177.2 million.\n\nSound Shore Management made the following regarding Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“For the year, we had a number of stocks up 50% or more and the list includes a diverse set of industries such as homebuilding, heavy truck manufacturing, and semiconductor capital equipment. We would like to highlight one outstanding contributor for the year, electricity generator and marketer Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), a low-cost provider with a healthy balance between generation and retail. Demand for electricity is growing and notably, load peaks are changing as well. As the country brings on more renewables and adjusts to greater demand later in the day due to increased use of electric heat pumps and electric car charging, reliable clean power is at a premium. Vistra is well positioned with diversified fuel sources including solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and battery power storage facilities, along with a marketing division to manage price volatility. The company will soon be closing its accretive acquisition of merchant power generator, Energy Harbor, and the deal will make Vistra the second largest carbon free, nuclear electricity provider behind Constellation Energy, another portfolio holding. Vistra CEO Jim Burke, leads a veteran utility management team that is committed to transitioning the company’s portfolio to a sustainable footprint by closing older fossil fuel plants and increasing the renewables portfolio. They have also been an important voice to advocate for changes that will accelerate the global transition to a clean, renewable energy future, while maintaining adequate near-term supply. Vistra has a strong balance sheet that allows the company to invest in innovation and operational improvements. Additionally, management is using excess cash flow to buy 40% of the outstanding shares over a five year period and they are more than half way through that process. Currently valued at 9 times earnings with a 17% free cash flow yield and a 2.3% dividend, the stock remains a full position. As you can see from the chart below, Vistra’s performance was quite different than many other electricity providers and provides further evidence of the disparate performance that can often be found within a sector.”\n\n9.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) says that it is bringing its Omniverse enterprise technology to Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.\n\nThe idea is to let developers use Nvidia’s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia’s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they’ll behave or look in the real world.\n\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\n\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\n\nThe company says it’s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud. A customer uses Apple's Vision Pro headset at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan in New York City, Feb. 2, 2024. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n“Apple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,” Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. “We look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.”\n\nThe move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia’s Omniverse is available on Apple’s high-end headset and gives Apple’s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\n\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\n\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Apple is in talks with Google to use its new Gemini artificial intelligence models to power the AI features for iPhones after previously discussing the prospect with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a new report.\n\nCiting people familiar, Bloomberg reported Monday that Apple is in \"active negotiations\" with Alphabet-owned Google's Gemini to run new features coming to iPhone software, but any potential deal would likely not be announced until Apple's Worldwide Development Conference (WWDC) in June. Apple is reportedly in talks with Google to use its Gemini artificial intelligence models to power upcoming features in iPhones.\n\nNeither Apple nor Google immediately responded to FOX Business' requests for comment on the report.\n\nMICROSOFT TELLS EUROPEAN REGULATORS GOOGLE HAS AN EDGE IN GENERATIVE AI\n\nA possible deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nIt could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIS GOOGLE TOO BROKEN TO BE FIXED? INVESTORS ‘DEEPLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY,’ FORMER INSIDER WARNS\n\nThe firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance. Apple previously spoke with OpenAI about the possibility of using its ChatGPT chatbot to run iPhone AI features, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google alleging it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its search dominance.\n\nGOOGLE RELEASES NEW GEMINI UPDATE TO GIVE USERS ‘MORE CONTROL’ OVER AI CHATBOT RESPONSES\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the iPhone maker was investing \"significantly\" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.\n\nStory continues Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a new iPhone 14 Pro during an Apple special event on September 07, 2022 in Cupertino, California.\n\nThe Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple, Google in talks for Gemini to power iPhone AI features: report",

It previously said it would do so “in a disciplined manner” to maximise value for its own shareholders.\n\nHaleon owns brands including Centrum vitamins, Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol pain relief. It recently sold off its Lamisil antifungal cream and Chapstick brands as it focuses on reducing its debt pile. By the end of 2023, it had reduced its debt by more than £2bn since its spin-off from GSK.\n\nGSK has already started selling down its position in Haleon. Last May, it sold 240m shares, taking its stake from 13pc down to 10.3pc . In October, it offloaded another 270m worth of shares and cut its position to 4.2pc in January this year.\n\nPfizer’s decision to start paring its stake back comes as it looks to focus more on its medicines and vaccines.\n\nThe US drugmaker is currently battling to bolster its pipeline of treatments after the end of a boost from the Covid pandemic, when it sold billions of dollars worth of its jabs.

Meta still uses a nearby building on Brock Street.\n\nBritish Land has marketed the site as a science and innovation building “in the heart of the Regent’s Place campus within London’s Knowledge Quarter”, which is home to leading research institutions including The Francis Crick Institute, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute and University College London.\n\nChief executive Simon Carter said:\n\nWe proactively took 1 Triton Square back from Meta to reposition it for science and innovation customers, with the expectation of unlocking significantly higher rents, whilst benefitting from a considerable surrender premium to further improve the economics.\n\nThis transaction is another example of how we drive value through establishing innovative JV partnerships, enabling us to flex our balance sheet, share the risk and crystallise the value created from Meta’s surrender premium.\n\nMark Evans of Royal London Asset Management Property added: “We have long recognised the demand for best-in-class science and innovation space, particularly in the Golden Triangle, and the need for this space in supporting the UK’s economic growth. Meta paid a £149m fee to landlord British Land as part of its exit from 1 Triton Place\n\n07:22 AM GMT\n\nCurrys boosts profit outlook as it moves past bidding war\n\nCurrys said profits are on track to be slightly better than expected as a bidding war for the electricals retailer came to an end.\n\nBosses said adjusted profit before tax is expected to be at least £115m, having previously said it would come in between £105m to £115m.\n\nThe company remains on track to offload its Greece business in the first half of April, which will leave the company in a net cash position at the end of the financial year.\n\nIt comes after Chinese tech giant JD.com announced on Friday it would not make an offer for Currys, days after US investors Elliott Management said it would not submit a third bid to take the UK listed business private. Currys said its pre-tax profit would be at least £115m this year, having previously predicted £105m to £115m - Jason Alden/Bloomberg\n\n07:12 AM GMT\n\nRed Sea crisis ‘causing 90-day shipping delays’ for UK manufacturers\n\nBritish manufacturers are facing delays of as long as 90 days for shipments of parts caused by disruption in the Red Sea.\n\nMake UK, the manufacturing trade association, has warned of the enduring effect of attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have been targeting commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea in protest at Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nMake UK said in its quarterly report:\n\nManufacturers are now reporting lead times increasing on average by two to three weeks, and even upwards of 90 days in some cases.\n\nThe challenge is that this creates bottlenecks across the supply chain as the delay of one component of even simple products can result in increasing lead times for goods.\n\nIt comes as the trade body warned the UK’s manufacturing sector faces two years of “anaemic growth”, with the sector forecasted to grow by just 0.1pc this year and 0.6pc next - half the rate of the broader economy in 2025.\n\n06:50 AM GMT\n\nHouse asking prices jump £5,000 in a month\n\nAsking prices have jumped by more than £5,000 so far this month as calm in the mortgage market fosters more confidence in property values.\n\nThe average price of a newly marketed house rose by 1.5pc to £368,118 in March, according to figures from Rightmove. That equates to a £5,279 increase, which markets the biggest rise in 10 months.\n\nIn a further sign of recovery for the UK housing market, the number of sales being agreed has risen 13pc compared with this time last year.\n\nTim Bannister, director of property science at Rightmove, said: “The stronger than usual price growth this March indicates that new sellers are feeling much more confident, with some perhaps being over-optimistic, that there is enough buyer activity and affordability in their local market to achieve a higher price.”\n\nLondon saw the biggest increase in demand for properties compared with this time last year, as slowing inflation, wage increases and a push back to offices among employers made the capital more appealing.\n\nMuch of the activity in the housing market has been driven by sales of properties to wealthy buyers for whom mortgage rates are less of an issue. So-called ‘top-of-the-ladder’ sales were up 18pc in March so far compared with last year, Rightmove said.\n\nDespite March’s jump, average asking prices are still £4,776 lower than their peak in May 2023.\n\nMr Bannister added:\n\nDespite the above-average price increases in this opening three months of the year, asking prices are still £4,776 below their peak in May 2023.\n\nFor those who can afford to buy and have yet to take action to move this year, this may provide a window of opportunity to buy as we now seem to be past the bottom of the market.\n\nWhile some sellers are still being overoptimistic with their pricing expectations, there are also more sellers who are aware of the need to be negotiable and realistic, with elevated interest rates compared to recent years still stretching affordability for many buyers. Rightmove has released its latest figures on UK house asking prices - Yui Mok/PA Wire\n\n06:47 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining us today. An improving mortgage market has given house sellers the confidence to demand an extra £5,000 for their home on average this month compared to February.\n\nRightmove said the value of newly marketed house has risen by 1.5pc to £368,118.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Migration surge drives London population to new record | Concerns over housing intensify as capital surpasses pre-pandemic peak\n\n2) Hunt hits landlords with stealth capital gains tax raid | Previous reduction in tax-free allowance offsets gains from lowered rate\n\n3) ITV cuts jobs amid advertising slump | Broadcaster faces biggest slump in advertising since financial crisis\n\n4) British Airways to use robot baggage handlers at Gatwick | Driverless baggage tugs to be rolled out as industry battles staff shortages\n\n5) Why Britain’s four-day week pioneer says he will never go back | Boss of UK challenger bank Atom believes office purists need to ‘grow up’\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian stocks advanced ahead of policy decisions this week by the Bank of England, Japan’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve.\n\nChinese data for January-February were mixed, with property investment falling while other indicators showed improvement.\n\nIn Tokyo, shares closed sharply higher as investors await a decision by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday on whether to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in 17 years.

        "title": "7 Stocks I Like on the Nasdaq Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Stock Market has been hitting new highs this year.\n\nNasdaq is a market with a dual personality. It's home to most large technology companies, and also the place where a slew of smaller stocks in other industries are traded.\n\nTech stocks have been the stock market's leaders last year and so far this year. Smaller stocks are starting to come alive.\n\nMost investors head to the Nasdaq for technology exposure. That's fine, but I wouldn't ignore the small fry in other industries. Here are seven Nasdaq stocks I like now.\n\nEast West\n\nEast West Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC), based in Pasadena, California, finances a lot of film and television projects. It's also one of the few U.S. banks licensed to do business in China.\n\nU.S.-China relations stink right now. And the major presidential candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump) aren't perceived as friendly to China. But neither was Richard Nixon, until he moved to open up a relationship with China in 1972.\n\nAny thaw in the U.S.-China relationship would be good for East West. Meanwhile, it is doing pretty well, having increased its earnings by more than 14% a year over the past 10 years.\n\nAgco\n\nSelling all kinds of agricultural equipment, from fertilizer to tractors, through a network of more than 3,000 dealers worldwide, Agco Corp. (NYSE:AGCO) has been profitable in each of the past 24 years.\n\nOver the past 10 years, it has increased its earnings at better than a 14% clip (coincidentally the same as East West). Its return on stockholders' equity lately has been running at 27%; I consider anything over 15% good. Yet the stock is cheap, selling for less than 8 times recent earnings.\n\nLegacy Housing\n\nBased in Bedford, Texas, Legacy Housing Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGH) makes manufactured homes and extra-small homes, serving the low end of the housing market.\n\nSince the U.S. has a shortage of single-family homes, and since paying for a home is a strain from many families, I think this company occupies a useful niche. The company has very little debt, and the stock sells for 9 times earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nPreformed Line\n\nPreformed Line Products Co. (NASDAQ:PLPC), which calls Cleveland, Ohio home, makes equipment for power lines and phone lines. It also makes mounting systems for solar panels.\n\nOver the past decade, Preformed has increased its earnings at a 19% annual pace. Last year growth was slower, at 7%. The stock sells for about 10 times earnings.\n\nMasterCraft Boat\n\nI've had poor luck with holdings in the boating industry. Nonetheless, I think that MasterCraft Boat Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MCFT) looks intriguing.\n\nThe company, out of Vonore, Tennessee, makes sport boats and outboard boats. The pandemic boosted boat sales because it's a form of recreation that is outdoors and doesn't involve crowds. Lately boat makers' sales have retreated, but if they level off, I like this stock at less than 7 times earnings.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWe don't want to neglect the big tech companies. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that have chalked up big gains in Alphabet's case, 373% over the past 10 years.\n\nAlphabet is the parent to Google, You Tube, Waymo and Deep Mind. Innovation is built into its culture, and the company has increased its earnings by an average of more than 21% a year over the past decade.\n\nThe stock is much more expensive than those discussed above, but I don't think that 24 times earnings is too much to pay here.\n\nApple\n\nEven more expensive, at 27 times earnings, is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of iPhones and Mac computers. Here there are worries, but also great strengths.\n\nEarnings growth, which averaged better than 16% over the past decade, slowed to 9% last year. The iPhone faces increased competition from Huawei in China. And the company's debt has climbed to 146% of equity.\n\nNonetheless, I still like Apple. It has a large and loyal following, and a history of successfully pulling rabbits out of hats in product development.\n\nTrack record\n\nEvery year in March, I write about my favorite stocks on the Nasdaq. Over 17 years, the average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 19.20%. The beats the average return on the Nasdaq Composite Index (16.30%) and the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index (13%).\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy picks from a year ago climbed 23.80%, which beat the Nasdaq Composite (20.80%) but not the S&P 500 (31.60%). The best performer was Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (NYSE:TMHC), up 57%. The worst was Cirrus Logic Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS), down 15%.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts. He or his clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column.

        "content": "It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.\n\nCommonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.\n\nJordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUS military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake. Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nKlein said he \"would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now\" and that Buffett \"knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.\n\nNews of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.\n\nWhile Buffett has said that his \"favorite holding period is forever,\" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.\n\nTrending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\nIn addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.\n\nKlein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.\n\nDan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of \"AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).\"\n\nFor long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.\n\nThe 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire’s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.\n\nRead More on Startup Investing:\n\nWealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.

(NYSE:SPOT) in its 2023 annual investor letter:\n\nSpotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is currently selling for about $15 billion. Does this make any sense?” We argued that Spotify stock was extremely mis-priced by the market. That aged pretty well as the current market cap for Spotify is ~$40 billion. Spotify’s stock skyrocketed +138% in 2023, strongly contributing to our outperformance. Spotify surpassed analyst expectations by adding 26% more monthly active users (MAUs) year-over-year in Q3 2023, reaching a total of 489 million (estimated to close the year with 600 million MAUs).

        "title": "Looks like Apple will need a partner to go all in on generative AI—but big antitrust issues await",
        "content": "Apple-watchers will have noted the company’s recent progression from “We’ve deployed machine learning for years and are too sui generis to talk about ‘AI’” to “We have a lot of AI stuff coming soon, honest!” But with Apple being way behind in the generative AI race it has now deigned to join, how will it catch up?\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report his morning, the answer lies in partnerships—at least, for what the publication calls the “heavy lifting of generative AI,” as opposed to the on-device AI action that would presumably/hopefully power a smarter Siri. It seems Apple has considered using OpenAI’s models for image generation and the like, but “active negotiations” with Gemini proprietor Google are underway.\n\nOf course, Apple and Google have already had a close partnership for nearly two decades, around making Google the default search engine in Safari. That bond is now being frayed by pressure from antitrust regulators in the U.S. (where the Justice Department has sued Google for paying Apple and others billions of dollars to make it the search default) and in Europe (where the new Digital Markets Act has forced Apple to prompt iOS Safari users to choose which search engine they want as their default).\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, a new AI deal could “help make up for” the falling value of Google and Apple’s search agreement—but it could also increase antitrust scrutiny for both companies. After all, the smartphone operating system market is essentially divided between the two companies, so having the same AI garnish on both Android and iOS could raise questions.\n\nWhat if Apple opts for OpenAI instead? Here, Microsoft enters into the equation. On the one hand, Microsoft’s patronage of OpenAI is also under antitrust scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, so an OpenAI-Apple deal could be quite useful in demonstrating that Sam Altman’s company is not effectively a Microsoft unit. But can you imagine if the deal were to extend to MacOS? Then the whole desktop operating system market would be powered by the same large language model.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps a more durable solution would be for Apple to partner with an AI company like Anthropic or Mistral, where the potential antitrust pitfalls aren’t quite so predictable. Or maybe Apple can get its act together on developing its own models into a competitive option.\n\nIncidentally, while on the subject, there’s a new report out that says OpenAI’s models have developed prejudices against speakers of African American English, “exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement… Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death.”\n\nApple won’t be using AI for such life-changing (or life-ending) decisions, but still, my advice would be to tread really carefully when deciding which models to use, and how to use them.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple on Monday fended off criticism that it has not done enough to open up its closed eco-system as required under the European Union's Digital Markets Act, saying it has complied with the landmark legislation.\n\nThe DMA sets out a list of obligations and prohibitions for Apple, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft which the six companies had to abide by on March 7.\n\nApple has in recent weeks announced a series of changes from allowing apps developers to distribute their iPhone apps directly to consumers instead of through Apple's App Store to letting developers distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of the App Store.\n\nThe company told apps developers, business users and rivals at a day-long hearing organised by the European Commission that it has redesigned its systems to comply with the DMA.\n\n\"We were guided first and foremost by ensuring that we've complied with the law. And then second, that we did it in a way that was consistent with our values and consistent with the language that we've developed with our users over a very long period of time. And we think we've accomplished that,\" Apple's lawyer Kyle Andeer told the hearing.\n\n\"And I think we're focused on it from a user perspective. Now, it's not to say that we're not focused on the impact of developers, but I think from our perspective first and foremost, we'll be tracking very carefully what's the impact of all of these different changes on the user experience that we've delivered to our customers for 15, 16 years through the iPhone?\"\n\nMeta will present its compliance efforts at a separate hearing on Tuesday, Amazon on Wednesday, Alphabet on Thursday, ByteDance on Friday and Microsoft next Tuesday.\n\nCompanies that fail to comply with the DMA risk investigations that can lead to fines of as much as 10% of their global annual turnover.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

Over the longer term, QCOM stock could also get a considerable boost from Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) renewal of its modem deal with the chip maker.\n\nFinally, Qualcomm recently reported encouraging quarterly financial results, and the valuation of QCOM stock is relatively low.\n\nGiven all of these points, I believe that investors looking for a conservative, long-term play on AI should consider buying QCOM stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA Good Play on Edge AI and the Increased Computerization of Autos\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, “Edge AI devices are connected to the internet and have their own AI rather than relying on distant data centers and the cloud (for AI capabilities).” And by using their own AI chips, these devices are able to process workload significantly more quickly and provide many more applications than systems that rely on cloud-based AI.\n\nAmong the apps enabled by devices with their own AI capabilities are “facial recognition and real-time traffic updates.” Edge AI devices also can assist healthcare practitioners more effectively than systems that use datacenters’ AI chips.\n\nIn October, QCOM stock introduced new AI chips for PCs and smartphones. Given the firm’s decades of experience with providing cutting-edge chips for smartphones and PCs, I’m confident that QCOM will benefit significantly from what I see as the coming proliferation of Edge AI.\n\nMeanwhile, in January, QCOM stock reported that it was developing hardware that would enable autos to exploit AI. Noting that its Snapdragon Digital Chassis, has been installed in over 350 million vehicles, the firm estimated that its “automotive-related revenue” would reach $4 billion “by 2026,” Seeking Alpha reported.\n\nWith autos becoming increasingly more computerized and AI likely to become significantly more advanced over the medium term and the long term, I think that many automakers will look to incorporate a significant amount of the technology into their products in the coming years. The latter trend, in turn, should meaningfully lift Qualcomm and QCOM stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nHelp From Samsung and Apple Is on the Way\n\nIn a note to investors on March 11, investment bank Rosenblatt Securities reported that the deliveries of Samsung’s Galaxy S24 had risen 13% compared with those of its predecessor, the S23, during the same period a year earlier. Moreover, the shipments of the Galaxy S24, which incorporate Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 chip, were 47% above the rate at which the S22 was delivered two years ago, Rosenblatt stated.\n\nMeanwhile, after Apple reportedly had difficulty creating its own modem chips, Qualcomm reported at the end of January that the iPhone maker had agreed to buy Qualcomm’s modem chips for another two years, through March 2027. The Street is likely still upbeat about the latter news.\n\nMoreover, I believe that ,given Apple’s past struggles with building its own modem chips, we can expect to see the tech giant eventually further extend its contract with Qualcomm in this area.\n\nStrong Quarterly Results and an Attractive Valuation\n\nIn QCOM’s fiscal Q1 which ended on Dec. 24, the firm’s earnings per share jumped 24% versus the same period a year earlier to $2.46, while its top line rose 5% year-over-year to $9.9 billion.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that its smartphone revenue rose 16% YOY, while its automotive revenue soared 31% YOY to a record $598 million.\n\nIn terms of valuation, the stock’s forward price-earnings ratio of 17.6 times is rather low and attractive, given its strong, positive catalysts.\n\nMoreover, the shares have a significant dividend yield of 1.9%.\n\nQualcomm’s high current profitability, along with its well-established smartphone business and attractive valuation, make it a good AI play for conservative investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAs their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAll seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA multi-industry leader has been a popular buy for billionaire investors\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) is pushing deeper into the generative AI space with its latest smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. The processor, which will be available in Android smartphones from Chinese manufacturers including Xiaomi and Honor, is the second addition to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 family.\n\nLike the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm is marketing the 8s Gen 3 as an on-device AI powerhouse. The company says that the processor supports a number of models including Meta's Llama 2 and Google's Gemini Nano.\n\nThe 8s Gen 3 places just below the standard 8 Gen 3 in terms of performance and pricing, meaning you'll likely find it in smartphones that are just under flagship devices. The company says it's taken a number of the major features from the top-of-the-line 8 Gen 3 and dropped them into the 8s Gen 3, including high-powered gaming performance.\n\nBut Qualcomm is largely positioning this chip as a generative AI processor. So far, on-device generative AI features include photo editing and real-time translation. Smartphone makers are increasingly leaning into the technology as a major selling point and the first major software change for devices in some time. Qualcomm is positioning its new Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 as a solid generative AI powerhouse. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nThe smartphone market has largely remained stagnant over the last few years with only incremental changes to cameras and processing speeds. As a result, consumers are more apt to hold onto their devices for longer periods of time, slowing down overall sales.\n\nGenerative AI, however, could be just what the market needs: a new, flashy capability that gets consumers to update their phones as faster clips.\n\nAndroid smartphone makers are taking an early lead with the technology, with both Samsung and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touting their latest offerings as generative AI-capable devices. Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI software during its WWDC developer conference, which will likely take place in June.\n\nWall Street analysts are pointing to generative AI as a potential catalyst for a boost in Apple's next-generation iPhone sales. And while the company hasn't made any announcements regarding what it's cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said he sees generative AI as a \"huge opportunity for Apple\" and that the iPhone maker will show off what it's been developing later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut generative AI apps and features are still in their early stages, and there's nothing quite interesting enough on the market yet to get people to start running out their front doors and into their nearest smartphone shops. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAnd some of the most well-known generative AI apps like ChatGPT are cloud-based, meaning it doesn't matter what kind of chip your smartphone is running; as long as you've got a connection to the internet, you'll likely be able to use the service.\n\nStill, as developers continue to develop the technology and roll it into more and more apps, chips capable of running them like the 8s Gen 3 will become increasingly important for users who want to take advantage of the software.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now.\n\nRate Cuts in June\n\nAs the US economy continues to settle down, financial professionals are continuing to keep a close eye on the inflation numbers and what they may imply for the markets and investors moving forward. Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.\"\n\nAccording to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe NVIDIA GTC Conference\n\nApart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.  On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the \"Halftime Report\" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.\"\n\nThese comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today. As such, our list below contains many of the fastest growing technology companies in the US, alongside some of the best American tech stocks to buy. 20 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds now, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter and selected the top 20 stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nMost Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now\n\n20.

The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We belief the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”\n\n18. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10.

(NYSE:UBER).\n\nHere's what RiverPark Advisors said about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n9. salesforce.com, inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 fastest growing AI stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nTech: A High-Growth Sector\n\nIf you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.\n\nOn March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.\"\n\nWinners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024\n\nAccording to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:\n\n\"Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThese \"winning\" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:\n\n\"I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.\"\n\nInvestors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in. 11 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nPhoto by Maximalfocus on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the high growth stocks for our list below by consulting the holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF and shortlisting 11 stocks with the highest share price gains over a 5-year period as of March 16.

During the quarter, shares sold off as reported billings growth missed expectations for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in a further lowering of 2023/2024 guidance. Currently, FTNT continues to face weaker demand following three consecutive years of elevated growth.

        "content": "Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher and artificial intelligence remains the hot trade among investors. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq Composite index is up 9%, while the benchmark S&P 500 has increased by 8% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 3%. While the rally is broadening out to include retailers, industrial players, and financial services concerns, technology stocks continue to outperform, with many of the top names having gained more than 20% through 10 weeks of the year.\n\nWith AI growing at an exponential rate and demand for its products and services remains strong, tech stocks can be expected to continue outperforming in the months ahead. Here are hot stocks: the three best opportunities for investing in technology.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp by more than 80% year to date, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top-performing stock in both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices so far in 2024. This builds on the 240% gain that NVDA stock achieved in 2023. If there’s one hot technology stock for investors to own now, it would be this microchip company. With a market capitalization of $2.20 trillion, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIncreasingly, NVDA stock exerts an outsized influence over the entire market. When the stock dips, the market does too. When Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the market rallies in support. As the leading producer of chips and semiconductors that power AI applications, Nvidia’s demand for its products and expectations for its share price remain sky-high. Analysts currently rate NVDA stock a “strong buy.” There are no sell ratings on the shares.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second best-performing tech stock of the year, and fourth among S&P 500 companies, is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ:META). So far in 2024, META stock has gained 40%. Over the last 12 months, the shares are up nearly 150%. Meta Platforms’ stock really took off after the company announced strong quarterly financial results and its first-ever dividend payment in early February.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Meta will pay its shareholders a dividend of 50 cents a share beginning on March 26 of this year. The company also announced an expanded $50 billion share repurchase program. While the rewards for stockholders are nice and the earnings have been impressive, Meta is also seen as a leader in AI and is gobbling up microchips from Nvidia at a fast pace to fuel its growing ambitions in the space.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another top-performing stock. NFLX stock is up more than 30% this year and has doubled in the last 12 months. This after the company overhauled its business model, adding paid advertisements to its platform for the first time, cracking down on password sharing, and moving into sports programming.\n\nThe end result has been that Netflix added 13.1 million net new subscribers in the final quarter of 2023, crushing forecasts that called for a maximum of nine million additions. Netflix is also one of the only streaming services that is turning a profit and is quickly separating itself from the pack in terms of content and subscriber growth. The strike last year by Hollywood writers and actors appears to have only been a speed bump for Netflix.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

        "title": "Nvidia Is the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock: Here's Why I Wouldn't Buy",
        "content": "The aptly named \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of (mostly) technology companies that have generally delivered above-average returns, especially over the past decade. Here is every member of this clique: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Though all have been admirable in delivering outsize returns, one of them, Nvidia, is in a class of its own.\n\nNone of the other Magnificent Seven members even get close to Nvidia's performance in the past 10 years. Yet, I still wouldn't invest in this company. NVDA Total Return Level Chart\n\nHeed advice from Warren Buffett\n\nWhen shares of companies rise as much as Nvidia's have, one of the first problems investors tend to think of is valuation. It's often the case that these corporations' future success is baked into their stock prices. Their shares will drop if they fail to live up to the market's lofty expectations. That may be the case with Nvidia, but that's not my rationale for staying away.\n\nThere is a simple and straightforward reason I wouldn't invest in Nvidia stock: My knowledge of the company's business is practically nonexistent. Nvidia is the leading player in manufacturing graphic processing units, critical electronic device components. This sounds like a great business model, but that is about the extent of my expertise, or lack thereof, in this area.\n\nSo, while Nvidia looks like a terrific company from an outsider's perspective, considering just how successful it has been over the past decade, I am in no mood to invest. Warren Buffett, the world's greatest investor, once said: \"Investment must be rational; if you can't understand it, don't do it.\"\n\nThere is no shortage of options\n\nFor what it's worth, I would also avoid investing in Tesla for the same reason. Am I missing out on some massive gains as a result? It's hard to say. If I made it a habit to invest in businesses I know nothing about, I might end up with some excellent stocks that have performed splendidly, like Nvidia and Tesla. But this approach would almost certainly result in some terrible investments, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's unclear whether the net effect on my overall returns would be positive. Thankfully, the rest of the Magnificent Seven stocks are all businesses I understand reasonably well. All of them, I think, are worth serious consideration. Let's pick Apple as an example. Though not as impressive as Nvidia's over the past decade, Apple's returns have also been excellent.\n\nFurther, the company has strong growth prospects. The iPhone is no longer the growth driver it used to be, but underestimating Apple's innovative capabilities would be a mistake. After all, the company didn't create cellphones -- it just made better versions of them and made a fortune in the process.\n\nApple's habit of creating a better mousetrap is well established. It now aims to do the same within generative artificial intelligence. Apple is trailing some of its peers in this area, but that has never stopped the company. Then, there is Apple's services segment, with an installed base of more than 2 billion active devices. The company has enough flexibility to monetize its user base in various ways.\n\nThe sky is the limit for Apple despite its recent slowing top-line growth. In my view, the company's shares still look like a buy. I'd say the same about Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Here's the lesson for investors: Missing out on some potentially amazing companies due to a lack of understanding regarding how they make money is not the end of the world.\n\nThere will always be other exciting stocks on the market whose businesses are much more comprehensible to each investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2 Cheap \"Tech\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The word \"cheap\" doesn't get applied to many tech stocks these days, especially after a rally that has seen the Nasdaq Composite index soar by 46% in the past year. And it's true that you'll have to pay much more for quality businesses today than you would have shelled out back in early 2023.\n\nThat's the price an investor must pay for a brighter sentiment on Wall Street. As billionaire Warren Buffett pointed out in 2008, \"If you wait for the robins, spring will be over.\"\n\nStill, there are always relative values in the market, especially if your investing time frame stretches across decades. Let's look at two attractively priced \"tech\" stocks (see below for an explanation of why \"tech\" is in quotes).\n\n1. This Apple looks tasty\n\nUnlike software rival Microsoft, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't in the $3 trillion market valuation club right now. That's mainly because the iPhone maker's shares have underperformed the market by a wide margin in recent months. The stock is up just 16% in the past year compared to Microsoft's 66% spike.\n\nThat gap sets up a potentially attractive buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nSure, Apple is going through a bit of a slump right now. Sales barely grew last quarter, rising just 2% year over year compared to Microsoft's 16% surge. Growth prospects don't look particularly encouraging for the next year or so, either. Most Wall Street pros are looking for about a 6% sales uptick next year following modest declines in fiscal 2024.\n\nConsider the value you get from owning Apple during this time of elevated pessimism, though. The stock is valued at just 7 times annual sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 14. Apple prioritizes ample cash returns, too, with $27 billion heading directly to shareholders last quarter alone in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\n\nThese cash returns, which mainly arrive through buybacks, should continue helping earnings per share outpace sales growth in 2024 and beyond. That will be a nice buffer for shareholders as they wait for Apple's new product releases -- along with its push into more services -- to reaccelerate growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Walmart should be considered a tech stock\n\nI know it might seem like a stretch to call Walmart(NYSE: WMT) a tech stock, but hear me out. The retailer just finished a fantastic year that saw e-commerce grow by 23% to cross $100 billion in annual sales. For context, Amazon grew its product sales by 5% in 2023, up to $256 billion; eBay reported $73 billion of annual sales volume.\n\nWalmart is also getting more revenue growth from other tech sources like its surging digital advertising business. It's little surprise, then, that profit margins are rising. The chain achieved 10% higher operating income last year, outpacing Walmart's 6% revenue uptick.\n\nEven with strong growth in its tech-focused segments, traditional retailing will be the main show at Walmart for the foreseeable future. The good news is that this division is firing on all cylinders, too. Customer traffic was up a healthy 4% year over year in the holiday period, customer satisfaction levels are rising, and the chain is snapping up market share in groceries and consumer discretionary products, including from higher-income shoppers.\n\nYou can own Walmart stock for a P/S below 1, or about the same valuation that you would pay for Target stock right now. That price seems like a great deal for a quickly growing e-commerce business that's supported by a dominant brick-and-mortar enterprise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the population change and growth trends in the States, you can go directly to 10 Cities With The Largest Population In The US.\n\nThe United States of America is a nation characterized by its vastness in terms of land, diversity, and population. With a total land area of over 3 million square miles, 50 states, and 19,495 incorporated cities, towns, and villages, the US is the fifth largest nation in terms of area worldwide. If we look at the population, according to Census Data, the country is home to a diverse population of 331,449,281 people.\n\nWhile the largest city in the US by area is Juneau, Alaska, the city only houses a population of 31,685. On the other hand, the largest city by population houses over eight million people, and is significantly smaller than Juneau in terms of land area. In other words, similar to the rest of the world, the population distribution in the US is not even.\n\nThe Census Bureau projects that in the next 57 years, by 2080, the nation’s population is expected to increase by another 35 million and reach the figure of 370 million. However, by 2100, the United States will see a rapid population decline, losing 10 million people within twenty years. Note that mortality rates are not the only factor that affects the population of a place — in the case of the States, the population trends will be greatly influenced in the coming years by the nation’s decreased fertility rates, aging population, and growing international migration trends.\n\nAlthough already uneven, the population distribution within the US is expected to change even more in the coming years. Forecasts suggest that the suburban and rural areas will see a rise in population, while the urban centers will see a notable decline. Mostly, this is because of the US’s aging population, and economic factors like inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven this factor, while the overall US population is expected to decline by the end of this century, there will be significant population distribution shifts as well. Some US cities will experience significant population growth, while others will see a sharp decline. As of 2024, the US cities with the largest population decline include Paradise, Nevada, and Jackson, Mississippi. (See also: 15 Biggest US Cities Facing Depopulation by 2100) On the other hand, according to the most recent Census data, the cities with the largest population growth include Dallas and other Texas cities.\n\nSome global key players also happen to have a significant presence in the largest cities in the US. For example, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, with the population distribution changes and overall population decline in the country, all companies may experience an eventual decline in the workforce. However, leading companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple have already started investing in innovation and technology, especially AI, so they may not be as significantly impacted by the future decline in population as one would think.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has made some notable investments in innovation and technology projects, such as Artificial Intelligence, to yield more efficiency and productivity. Last year in 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $13 billion in OpenAI, integrating AI technology into its Bing search engine, GitHub coding tools, Azure Cloud, sales and marketing software, and more.\n\nSimilarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a world leader in the smartphone industry, is also investing hugely in generative AI technology, Tim Cook, the CEO, said in the annual shareholder meeting. He further stated in the virtual meeting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will break new grounds with generative AI and assist in productivity, problem-solving, and more.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has established a $1 billion venture investment program, supporting emerging technology companies with direct investments. As the company prioritizes productivity, it has made close to a dozen investments in companies with promising automating products, such as Rightbot.\n\nOverall, today, the presence of giant companies in the major cities in the US contributes to the economic growth and development of the cities and the country at large. Below, we discuss the cities with the largest population in the US as of 2024. 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\n50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the largest U.S. cities by population, we have sourced data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, and World Population Review (for Nashville city estimates only). Note that based on the most recent available data provided by the Census, our list is based on the 2022 estimates. For city-specific information mentioned in our list, we have sourced data from the US Census Bureau Quick Facts table. The list is in descending order, going from the 50th most populous US city to the 1st most populated one.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 30 most expensive cities to live in the US in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the US in 2024.\n\nIn June 2022, inflation in the US reached its highest point in four decades but subsequently decreased by December 2023. This decline can be attributed to actions such as the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, improvements in supply chain efficiency, and a reduction in gasoline prices. However, despite the drop in inflation, it remains significantly high compared to pre-pandemic levels. The overall inflation rate in the US as of February 2024 stood at 3.2%, up from 3.1% in January. While inflation has decreased from its peak of 9.1% in 2022, it remains significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This situation has led to financial difficulties for many Americans.\n\nComparing prices in December 2023 to those in January 2020 reveals a significant increase, with overall prices rising by 19%, food prices by 25%, energy prices by 26%, and shelter service prices by 21%. Meanwhile, wages for workers in private industries saw a rise of 4.3% by December 2023, compared to 5.1% in December 2022. Furthermore, US employers are planning to increase salaries by an average of 4.0% in 2024. This is slightly lower than the 4.4% increase in 2023 but still higher than the 3.1% increase seen in previous years. In 2023, pay raises outpaced inflation for the first time since 2020, highlighting a more stable job market compared to the period from 2008 to 2020.\n\nIn January 2024, the unemployment rate remained stable at 3.7% for the past three months, marking a decrease from January 2021, when it stood at 6.4%. However, despite these positive signs in the job market, the high inflation rate has continued to impact major companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In October 2023, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), voiced concerns about the effects of increased interest rates, stating that they offset the benefits of Tesla's price reductions and lower people's ability to purchase cars. Additionally, the higher interest rates and global economic uncertainties have impacted Tesla's plans to expand its factory in Mexico.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what Fred Alger Management said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.” 30 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the US in 2024\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 30 most expensive cities to live in the US in 2024, we conducted a thorough cost-of-living analysis using credible sources such as Numbeo and International Living.

        "title": "Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "content": "March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.\n\nGiven Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEarnings are driving the Nvidia story\n\nNvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThe only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.\n\nThe easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.\n\nNvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.\n\nBuying Apple when it is out of favor has historically been a genius move\n\nSo why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.\n\nMarket sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.\n\nThe abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.\n\nPiper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.\n\nInvestors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.\n\nThe pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.\n\nApple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.\n\nApple has a better risk/reward profile than Nvidia\n\nNvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.\n\nNvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Trillion-Dollar Crystal Ball: 3 Companies Next in Line for the Market Milestone",
        "content": "There are only six trillion-dollar stocks worldwide, every one of which is a popular name. And they all rightfully sit at the top of their sectors.\n\nThere’s a certain allure to reaching $1 trillion, and investors are always looking for the next one to breach that valuation. Yet, achieving that kind of market cap requires expert management, multiple and growing revenue streams. Additionally, it demands a realistic, overarching vision of the company’s development in the short and long term.\n\nLuck and the occasional massive swings in market sentiment and investor interest indeed play a part in increasing valuations. Putting those aside, though, a handful of companies have the potential to join the list of trillion-dollar stocks, either through solid financial foundations, sheer market dominance, or a reputation as a reliable provider for a burgeoning sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s talk about the next trillion-dollar stocks and the reasons you should consider investing in them now.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is an excellent example of the benefits of diversification. This multinational holding company’s primary focus is insurance (divided into underwriting and investments). And it has interests in many industries and markets, including railroad, energy, gas station chains, retail supplies, and manufacturing. Most importantly, Warren Buffet, arguably the most popular investment investor of the 21st century, heads it up.\n\nAfter ending 2022 at a net loss, 2023’s year-end report is a breath of fresh air for the company. Insurance revenue grew 5%, while revenue from all the other segments and markets nearly doubled year over year (YOY). Meanwhile, the most significant turnaround came from investment and derivatives, which recorded a $74.86 billion gain from last year’s $67.89 billion loss.\n\nThis success hasn’t gone unnoticed by the larger investing public. In fact, shares of BRK-B peaked at an all-time high of $430 on February 26, 2024, bringing its total valuation to more than $900 billion. Currently, the company is the closest one to breach the $ 1 trillion mark. This could be a novel development, as Berkshire Hathaway would be the first non-tech U.S. company to join the $1T club.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his annual letter to investors, Warren Buffet tempered expectations about massive growth in the short term. However, he had no reservations in expressing his company’s resiliency.\n\n“I believe Berkshire can handle financial disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore experienced,” he stated, outlining the company’s strong financial position and many diversified investments.\n\nBRK-B’s financial statement backs up his claim, having a record $167.64 billion in cash and cash equivalents in 2023, including short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills.\n\n“Berkshire,” Buffet said, “is built to last.”\n\nEli Lilly and Company (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is currently the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world, boasting a market capitalization that exceeds $750 billion. While mostly known for diabetes and clinical depression medication, the company offers more than 50 different drugs to the global market.\n\nLLY’s latest report showcased an impressive $2.19 billion revenue growth to $2.49 billion from new products, primarily led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. This represents roughly 26% percent of its total revenue. Additionally, quarterly revenue ended at $9.35 billion, representing a 28% growth YOY. Meanwhile, GAAP EPS came in flat with analyst expectations, ending at $2.42, or a 13% YOY increase.\n\nAs mentioned, one of its most notable products is Zepbound, a weight-loss injection that got massive coverage upon its recent FDA approval. So far, the drug has generated $175.8 million in its first selling quarter, with more growth foreseen as LLY accelerates production and distribution.\n\nLike the company itself, analysts are confident about Zepbound’s prospects. Morgan Stanley expects $2.2 billion in revenue for 2024, while Bank of America laid out a more optimistic $2.7 billion. Other notable drugs are Verzenio, which recorded the highest quarterly dollar value growth YOY, and Tyvyt, which nearly doubled in revenue. With such a high potential for growth, many investors think that LLY is about to join the list of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe pandemic chip shortage during Covid-19 was a curious event.\n\nChip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) saw their market caps balloon as investors flocked to take a piece of the massive shortage demands.\n\nTSM breached the $700B mark in 2022, but soon prices fell back. Yet, they remained well above their pre-pandemic levels. Now, prices are approaching their pandemic highs, and TSM’s market cap is around $656 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I’m bullish on TSM reaching trillion-dollar stock status is its client base. The company mass-produces integrated circuits for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). More important clients include the trillion-dollar companies of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Furthermore, TSM’s 3-nanometer N3 chips are the de facto leader in the industry. The company is gearing up to produce 2nm N2 chips, expected to arrive in 2025.\n\nThe chip shortage may be over, but the accelerating demand for AI is still driving growth in the tech sector. TSM anticipates a 20% revenue increase in 2024 as a result.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most",
        "content": "In this article, we will be analyzing the population dynamics in the US and the 15 US cities where the population decreased the most. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most.\n\nPopulation Dynamics in the US\n\nThe United States ranks among the most populous countries worldwide. As reported by the US Census Bureau, the country’s population is 336,167,022, as of March 14. Region-wise, the South accounted for 38.9% of the population growth in 2023. Population growths of 23.6% for the West, 20.6% for the Midwest, and 17% for the Northeast were reported in 2023. Some of the most populous US states include California, Texas, Florida, and New York. You can also take a look at the most densely populated cities in the US.\n\n2022 showed the first signs of US recovery from the global pandemic in terms of population growth. This was when the US population was reported to have increased by 0.4%. The primary driver of this growth was the net international migration which added 1,010,923 people to the national population.\n\nFuture prediction represents a slow-paced population growth for the country over the coming years. On November 9, 2023, the US Census Bureau reported that the US population has been forecasted to approach almost 370 million in 2080 before moving downward to 366 million in 2100. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth. Simultaneously, a natural decrease in the country’s population will be supported by declining fertility rates and an aging population. The reduced fertility rates will also impact the nation’s age structure, leading to more adults aged 65 and above as compared to children under the age of 18.\n\nDeclining Populations: Past Trends and Future Projections\n\nOne year into the pandemic, the US Census Bureau reported that some of the fastest-growing US cities during the pre-pandemic period, witnessed slower growth rates after the pandemic. Population growth especially slowed in the cities of Leander in Texas and Meridian in Idaho.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to the fastest declining cities, San Fransisco ranked at the top in 2021 when it was not even a part of the list in 2019. Even for the city of Cupertino which had been a declining city in both 2019 and 2021, the drop in its population growth was almost triple. Overall, six of the top fifteen declining cities were based in California. The largest numeric decrease in population was recorded in New York City, San Fransisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles.\n\nA recent study reveals that almost half of the 30,000 US cities will be subject to depopulation by 2100. This study initially began as a project commissioned by the Illinois Department of Transportation to carry out an analysis of the challenges in transportation that could arise from population changes in Illinois. However, a deeper analysis showed that the biggest population losses will be taking place in the Northeast and Midwest of the country as the population moves to the South and West. States such as Texas and Utah where the population tends to be growing as of now, will be seeing a fair share of their cities undergoing depopulation in the future. The population will also be declining in the cities situated in Illinois, Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Michigan. Overall, some sort of depopulation has been forecasted for all US states except for the District of Columbia and Hawaii.\n\nBusiness in the Depopulating State of California\n\nCalifornia is home to a majority of cities where the population has decreased the most in recent years. It is an important US state in terms of business as well. The state boasts a robust technology sector. Some of the dominant technology firms in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to. Some of the biggest California companies and stocks have also been previously discussed.\n\nThe tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is headquartered in Cupertino, California. Recently, the company made a development in the laptop space and launched a new and  more powerful MacBook Air. On March 4, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that the new 13- and 15‑inch MacBook Air will be available beginning March 8. Using the powerful M3 chip, the MacBook Air tends to be up to 60% faster than the model having an M1 chip. It also ranks as the world’s best consumer laptop for AI while allowing up to 18 hours of battery life. Based on the improved performance and features, the 13-inch model serves as the bestselling laptop globally while the 15-inch model is the bestselling 15-inch laptop around the world.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) offers more than 100 AI-enabled solutions under its artificial intelligence portfolio. On March 7, the company unveiled the industry’s largest portfolio of AI PCs. This includes HP Elite PCs which serve as the leading business laptops for collaboration in the world, and Z by HP mobile workstations. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has also announced program enhancements for channel partners under which they will now be capable of accessing the first role-based AI partner training and certification program.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another California-based technology company that is enabling the penetration of generative AI, an emerging tech trend. On March 7, the company reported the introduction of a new professional certification in generative AI. Developers and professionals can polish their proficiency in AI through this professional certification program from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which encompasses two associate-level generative AI certifications. The certification will focus on large language models and multimodal workflow skills. You can also take a look at the fastest-growing technology companies in the US.\n\nNow that we have navigated through the population dynamics in the US, depopulating cities and their business potential, we can move to the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most. 15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most\n\n15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most, we sourced data from the US Census Bureau. For our rankings, we focused on cities that recorded the most recent population declines. Hence, we acquired the city-wise population estimates for 2020 and 2022. Comparing both populations, we found the percentage change in city populations from 2020 to 2022. Finally, we ranked the cities with the highest declines in population from 2020 to 2022, in ascending order of their population declines.\n\n15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most\n\n15.

        "title": "This Warren Buffett \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is Riskier Than You Think",
        "content": "Many of you are aware of Warren Buffett's legendary investment in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). He and his lieutenants started buying shares in 2016 and 2017 for Berkshire Hathaway, making it the largest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio. Today, the stake is worth an estimated $175 billion. Shares are up over 500% since the beginning of 2017, making the Apple investment one of Buffett's best purchases ever.\n\nBut just because Apple has done well in the past does not mean it will do well in the future. There are looming risks with this \"Magnificent Seven\" favorite that I believe are underappreciated by investors right now. Here's why Apple stock remains risky for investors to own in 2024.\n\nStagnating revenue, lackluster Vision Pro launch\n\nThe first concern with Apple is broad-based: Revenue is stagnating. Despite high inflation around the world in the last few years, Apple's revenue on a trailing-12-month basis is actually down from the middle of 2022. Adjusted for inflation, this means that Apple's sales have taken quite a hit in the last few years.\n\nThe only hardware segment that grew sales in fiscal Q1 2024 was the iPhone, hitting $70 billion in revenue for the holiday quarter compared to $66 billion a year prior. This business should remain solid for Apple if it can continue to raise prices, but unit sales for smartphones have stagnated for years. The days of hyper-growth for the iPhone are likely over. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSo how can Apple increase its revenue? Setting aside its burgeoning services segment, Apple needs to find another hardware device that can drive sales. It certainly won't be the iPad, Watch, or Mac segments, which serve as either niche or adjacent products to the iPhone. But what about the Vision Pro mixed reality headset? It launched earlier this year and sports a $3,500 price tag. If Apple can start selling a lot of Vision Pros, this could drive growth over the next decade.\n\nThe problem is that the Vision Pro looks like a flop. A lot of buyers are returning their devices, with many saying they have stopped using it regularly. Time will tell, but so far it looks like the Vision Pro is far from the next iPhone. To drive sales growth for a company like Apple, the Vision Pro will have to become a global hit. That has not happened with its first iteration and is likely many years away from happening, if it ever does.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeopolitical headwinds with major financial implications\n\nStagnant revenue isn't the only concern for Apple. There are major looming risks from government regulations that could eliminate some of its historical cash cows.\n\nFirst, the Chinese government is increasing its oversight and regulations against Apple products. It is widening the iPhone ban across governmental agencies as the East Asian giant expands its conflict with Apple's home country, the United States. Last quarter, 17.4% of Apple's sales came from China. If this goes away, it would be a major hit to Apple's income statement.\n\nSome investors might argue that Apple's services segment will drive growth. It has in the past and is now a much larger part of the business. Last fiscal year, services brought in $85 billion in high-margin revenue from things like Apple Music, the App Store, and AppleTV+. The issue is that governments are attacking Apple's App Store and distribution payments from Google.\n\nWe are seeing increasing regulatory attention focused on the App Store. The E.U. just fined Apple around $2 billion solely for being anticompetitive in the music streaming business. Multiple governments are debating whether to pass regulation against the App Store and its 30% take rate on digital transactions, which generates a ton of high-margin revenue for Apple each year.\n\nPerhaps more important is Apple's distribution payment that it receives from Google Search each year. It is estimated that the search giant pays Apple upwards of $20 billion just to be the default search engine on Apple devices. This is basically pure profit and would make up a large chunk of the Mac maker's $118 billion in annual operating earnings. The courts in the United States are debating whether this payment from Google is anticompetitive. If they decide it is, $20 billion in annual earnings could be immediately wiped away from Apple's income statement.\n\nThe valuation is not appealing, either\n\nIf we look at Apple's stock price, it shows that the company's valuation is not very attractive for a low-growth operation. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 27, which is right around the market average but still sits at a premium to faster-growing companies like Alphabet, the parent of Google Search.\n\nAnd these trailing earnings do not take into account any future headwinds from China, a Vision Pro flop, or the potential steep reduction in high-margin services revenue. Add everything together, and Apple may be the riskiest Magnificent Seven stock to own in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Companies Paid a Record $1.7 Trillion in Dividends Last Year. These 3 Dividend Stocks Led the Way.",
        "content": "According to a report by Janus Henderson Global, companies paid a staggering $1.7 trillion in dividends to their shareholders in 2023. That was a record amount of cash payments, 5% above 2022's total.\n\nHundreds of companies helped drive the corporate sector's record dividend outlay. However, three rose to the top as the biggest payers: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). Here's a look at what they paid investors last year and whether these leading dividend stocks can continue enriching their investors through dividends.\n\nMicrosoft's monster dividend\n\nMicrosoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, which was the most of any company. The technology titan is routinely one of the top dividend-paying stocks. It was the leader in 2020, placed second in 2021, and was third in 2022. It was able to reclaim its spot at the top by increasing its dividend (it boosted its dividend per share by 10% in each of the last two years). Meanwhile, the leader of the last two years, mining giant BHP Group, has paid less in dividends due to lower commodity prices.\n\nMicrosoft can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the last six months, Microsoft has produced nearly $50 billion in net cash flow from operations while paying $10.6 billion in dividends. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74 billion in debt. That strong financial profile helps support its elite AAA credit rating.\n\nThe technology company is also investing heavily in its growth, including acquiring gaming company Activision and developing AI technology with OpenAI. These and other catalysts should enable Microsoft to grow its cash flow, giving it even more money to pay dividends.\n\nA cash-rich tech titan\n\nFellow tech giant Apple clocked in at No. 2, paying $14.9 billion in dividends last year. That was slightly more than it paid in 2022, thanks to dividend increases. Apple raised its per-share payment by 4.3% last year, following a 4.5% bump in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its big-time payout. The technology giant produced $110.5 billion in cash from operating activities during 2023. It also boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. Apple ended the year with a jaw-dropping $162 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $111 billion of debt.\n\nThat also allows the company to invest heavily in research and development to launch innovative products that drive revenue and cash-flow growth. It recently launched its Vision Pro VR headset and is starting to invest more heavily in generative AI. These growth drivers should enable Apple to produce more cash that it could use to pay dividends in the future.\n\nA cash-gushing oil stock\n\nExxonMobil was right behind Apple at around $14.9 billion in dividend payments last year. The oil giant has steadily increased its dividend. It raised its payment by 4.1% late last year, its 41st straight year of dividend growth. It also grew its payout by 3.4% in late 2022.\n\nThe energy company produced a prodigious amount of cash last year despite lower oil and gas prices. Free cash flow actually increased by $1.9 billion last year to $36.1 billion, thanks to its focus on investing in high-margin capital projects. While ExxonMobil returned an industry-leading $32.4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, it still grew its cash balance to $31.6 billion.\n\nExxonMobil's high-return investment strategy has it on track to double its earnings potential by 2027. On top of that, the company agreed to buy rival Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal worth more than $60 billion, which will further enhance its ability to grow its free cash flow. These and other catalysts should give ExxonMobil more than enough fuel to continue growing its monster dividend.\n\nHigh-quality dividend stocks\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and ExxonMobil led the world in dividend payments last year. The massive companies produce enormous cash flows, giving them the money to invest in growing their businesses, pay ever-increasing dividends, and maintain cash-rich balance sheets. Those features make them ideal stocks for those seeking very safe and steadily rising dividends.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other U.S.-Based Company",
        "content": "Many income investors focus mainly on a company's track record for making and raising dividend payments, and the dividend yield. But if you've been wondering which companies pay the most dividends, you've come to the right place.\n\nThe top candidates would be large companies with high yields, but the two companies with the highest dividend expenses are actually Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -- both \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nHere's a look at the 10 U.S.-based companies with the largest dividend expenses, why Microsoft leads the group, and why Microsoft is worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft's multibillion-dollar annual dividend hikes\n\nOther than ExxonMobil and Bank of America, the 10 U.S. companies with the largest dividend expenses are all in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is known for having industry-leading companies as its components. MSFT Total Dividends Paid (TTM) Chart\n\nIf you follow the purple line in the chart, you'll see that Microsoft's dividend payment has increased significantly, especially recently. In fact, it has nearly doubled over the last six years. For fiscal 2024, Microsoft increased its dividend by more than 10%. Because it is such a large company, each 5% increase in the dividend translates to around $1 billion more in dividend expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has made bare minimum dividend raises of 1 cent per share per year for the last few years. Apple prefers to return money to shareholders via stock buybacks rather than with dividends.\n\nDon't underestimate Microsoft's dividend\n\nMicrosoft has a below-average yield of just 0.7% -- but that's still the most of any Magnificent Seven stock, even when factoring in Meta Platforms' new dividend.\n\nMicrosoft has made sizable dividend hikes, but its stock price growth has well outpaced that dividend growth rate, which has resulted in a shrinking yield over time. Over the last decade, management has nearly tripled the dividend, yet the yield has fallen from more than 2.5% to 0.7% simply because of the stock's monster 900% gain over that time.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nIf you're looking to build passive income streams for the long haul, then a company's ability and willingness to raise its dividend will prove more important than its current yield. Microsoft stands out because it can afford to raise its dividend regularly, buy back stock, fund its operations, invest in research and development, and still maintain a balance sheet with more cash than debt.\n\nEssentially, Microsoft can do it all. It's better to view its dividend as a cherry on top of its investment thesis instead of looking at it in isolation.\n\nBuilding an investment thesis\n\nThere are three basic ways a company can reward its shareholders -- capital gains, dividends, and stock repurchases. When considering whether to invest in a stock, it's important to understand which of those levers the company is most focused on pulling.\n\nFor many companies, it's all about capital gains. Amazon and Tesla, for example, fit in that category: They don't pay dividends and have large stock-based compensation programs, which increase their outstanding share counts and dilute their existing shareholders.\n\nFor a stodgy dividend-payer like Procter & Gamble, dividends and buybacks are arguably a bigger part of the investment thesis than potential share price gains. Although P&G can still surprise to the upside -- the stock is up by more than 9% year to date and is beating the S&P 500.\n\nThen there are the rare companies that both have plenty of room to grow and also reward their shareholders with buybacks and dividends. Microsoft is in this elite category. Over the last five years, the company has reduced its share count by 3%, raised its dividend by 63%, and its stock price is up by more than 255%. It has delivered the trifecta for shareholders.\n\nLeveraging AI across business channels\n\nMicrosoft stands out as one of the most well-rounded buys in the stock market right now because it is a relatively low-risk but high potential-reward company. With such high cash flow and a strong balance sheet, Microsoft can afford to make mistakes, fund acquisitions, try something new, and take risks at times when many other companies lack the capital or market position to do so. Microsoft also has a clear path toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It has multiple high-margin business units that are related but still diversified.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot is an AI assistant that works across multiple applications, among them the Microsoft 365 programs and GitHub. On Microsoft's fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings call, management went into detail about the many ways that Copilot is helping its customers save time and drive efficiency, and it's contributing to the bottom line.\n\nEven if Copilot hits a snag and its impact on growth across all these products turns out to be limited, it's not the company's only AI play. There's also Azure AI for Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which serves a completely different industry than Copilot targets.\n\nIn sum, Microsoft's AI aspirations don't hinge on a single product or idea. AI is already boosting the company's profitability and contributing to growth, and there's no reason to believe that trend will slow down anytime soon.\n\nExpect that to produce a snowball effect. Microsoft could choose to accelerate its share price growth, return capital to shareholders through larger buybacks, or raise its dividend at a faster rate. Investors stand to benefit no matter which lever Microsoft chooses to pull.\n\nMicrosoft sports a premium valuation for good reasons\n\nThe only issue with Microsoft is its valuation. It trades at a 36.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is well above its historical average and the S&P 500's 27.8 average P/E ratio. The stock isn't cheap, which shows that investors already have high expectations for Microsoft.\n\nDon't expect Microsoft's valuation expansion to continue. The gains will have to be driven by earnings, which isn't a bad thing. It just means some of the \"easy money\" has already been made.\n\nThe good news is that Microsoft has a multidecade runway for growing earnings and rewarding its shareholders. Even with the stock's expensive price tag, Microsoft stands out as one of the safer ways to invest in AI and collect some passive income in the process.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For two decades, no company better embodied the promise of the stock market than Apple Inc. Its transformation from niche computer maker to the most valuable corporation on the planet made its shares a cornerstone of investment portfolios worldwide.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Warns Russia Won’t Be Stopped After Record Election Win Saudi Wealth Fund Said to Be in Talks to Buy National Airline Boeing’s Pain Spreads to Travelers as Airlines Cut Back on Plans Apple Without AI Looks More Like Coca-Cola Than High-Growth Tech\n\nBut in what seems like a blink of an eye, Apple’s sheen is starting to fade. Artificial intelligence is the story in technology now, driving the kind of growth that the company used to count on from selling its gadgets and services to eager consumers across the globe.\n\nThis has Apple investors in a quandary. Its revenue expansion is stagnating, and the stock is underperforming the Nasdaq 100 by about 16 percentage points, the most to start a year since 2013. The company still generates massive revenues, but whether that can keep increasing at the pace investors have come to expect is an open question. Apple executives say they have big plans for AI, which bulls hope will help revive growth. But so far it’s hard to gauge its prospects.\n\nAll of which has investors wondering, if Apple’s AI dreams don’t come to fruition, what is the role of the shares today?\n\n“It’s become more of a value stock, a bit like Coca-Cola,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management and chief market strategist at Osaic. “All the things you want that’s going to offer you a defensive profile and market rate returns for the foreseeable future until they have a new catalyst.”\n\nApple remains the reliable money machine it’s always been. It’s certainly a shareholder-friendly cash flow juggernaut, and a safe haven with a bulletproof balance sheet.\n\n“If you’re a long-term investor that really likes solid, stable growth, that’s very annuity like, with growing margins, improving profitability and a business that generates significant amounts of cash and still has lots of innovation runway, we think Apple is a great place to be,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut investors looking to buy into the next big growth market have turned their attention to AI. Nvidia Corp. is taking Apple’s place as the tech behemoth to own due to the seemingly insatiable demand for chips used to power large language models.\n\nValuation Wipeout\n\nApple has fallen more than 10% this year, erasing around $330 billion in market capitalization, and ceding its position as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp., whose incorporation of ChatGPT into products like its Office software is starting to boost revenue growth. Microsoft now has a market value of almost $3.1 trillion versus Apple’s $2.7 trillion. Nvidia, whose revenue and profits have soared amid an arms race for AI computing power, isn’t far behind at $2.2 trillion.\n\nRead More: Microsoft Dethrones Apple as Most Valuable Stock in the World\n\nThe problem isn’t so much that Apple has suddenly stopped growing, that’s been happening for a while — its revenue shrank in every quarter of its last fiscal year even as the stock was hitting records. The trouble is the company hasn’t shown anything on AI at a time when iPhones sales are sluggish and the company is facing mounting regulatory threats.\n\n“We’re going through an incredible wave of innovation,” said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities. “The market is telling you that Apple has a lot to prove here and to date they haven’t shown much.”\n\nNotoriously secretive, Apple has divulged little about its plans to incorporate AI services into its products. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple would “break new ground” in AI this year and market professionals are anticipating big news at the company’s annual software developer’s conference in a few months. However, many investors are losing patience and turning to stocks with a clearer path in AI.\n\nRead More: Apple Buys Canadian AI Startup as Part of Race to Add Features\n\nAt the core of Apple’s woes is the disappearance of revenue growth and it’s unclear what, if anything, will stoke it. The company’s first major new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro headset, isn’t expected to contribute significantly to growth for years. Apple recently pulled the plug on its long effort to build an electric car. At the same time iPhone revenue has stagnated and sales in China have dropped amid a weak economy and greater competition.\n\nRegulatory Pressures\n\nOn top of that Apple is facing mounting pressure from regulators. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion by the European Union over an investigation into claims it blocked music-streaming rivals on its platforms. In the US, the Justice Department appears close to filing an antitrust lawsuit after five years of work building a case alleging Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads to impede competition from rivals.\n\nSales in fiscal 2023 fell 3% and are projected to rise just 2% in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, revenue expanded at a 33% clip in 2021. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s sales are projected to jump 79% and Microsoft’s 15% in the companies’ current fiscal years.\n\nFor the past couple of years, Apple has commanded a premium valuation on par with Microsoft’s. Two years ago, when tech stocks got hit hard, the shares held up far better than those of its peers. But that’s no longer the case. Apple is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from about 30 times last summer. That’s similar to Walmart Inc.‘s valuation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is priced at 32 times and Nvidia at 35 times.\n\nRead More: Apple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion Gift\n\nThat said, Microsoft trading at a record high may actually offer a good example of Apple’s long-term potential. When Satya Nadella took over the company in 2014 it was a software maker with a 20th century mindset and a languishing stock. Now it’s everywhere, from the cloud to AI, and its stock is soaring.\n\n“Everyone has to reinvent themselves, and it just shows you how quick the revolution in tech is,” Citizens JMP’s Lehmann said. “Microsoft finally got going, but it took them 15 years to figure it out.”\n\nDespite this year’s gloomy performance, it’s easy to make the case that Apple shares are poised for a rebound and that it’s too early to count it out of the AI race. The company has more than $170 billion in cash on its balance sheet and its net income is expected to top $100 billion this year. That gives Apple unmatched resources to push into new markets and still return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\n“It’s hard to not compare to what’s the hot thing right now,” Jensen Investment Management’s Walkush said. “If you took AI out of the picture right now, and the sensationalism, would people look at Apple differently? I think they would.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy Gold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them When It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Please remain on the line and your conference will begin at approximately two minutes after the hour. Please remain on the line. Your conference will begin at approximately two minutes after the hour. Thank you.\r\n Good day, and welcome to Zedge's earnings conference call for the second fiscal quarter 2024 results. During management's prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen only mode. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to your host, Brian Siegel, the floor is yours.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nThank you, operator. In today's presentation, Jonathan Reich, Zedge's Chief Executive Officer; and Yi Tsai, the Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our financial and operating results that were reported today. Any forward-looking statements made during this conference call during the prepared remarks or in the question-and-answer session. Whether general or specific in nature are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in the future to differ materially from those discussed on today's call.\r\n These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to specific risks and uncertainties disclosed in the reports Zedge parent periodically files with the SEC assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to update the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that they forecast. Please note that our earnings release is available on the Investor Relations page of this EDGE website. The earnings release has also been filed on Form 8-K with the SEC.\r\n I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Reich\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin by briefly reviewing our second quarter results, demonstrating how our fiscal year 2023 investments have positioned us for sustainable long-term growth.\r\n Q2 revenue increased 11% from last year as we continued managing the geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry specific challenges spanning the landscape. One of the big stories this past quarter was continued momentum at the Zedge marketplace. Ad revenue was up 18% from last year. Zedge plus our marketplace subscription offering delivered exciting results with revenue increasing 24% from last year with small net subscriber gains sequentially and less than 1% net subscriber loss year over year.\r\n And Zedge Premium revenue driven by several improvements to content monetization and other back-end front-end items was up 21%. These factors fueled a 37% increase in the average revenue per monthly active user or RPU.\r\n Now to a record $0.072, and this strength was not just on Android as IOS revenue for the Zedge marketplace was up an impressive 46% sequentially. I should add that many of these trends are holding up at the halfway point of our fiscal third quarter. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we said building a full-stack marketing team would be our key corporate-wide initiative similar to what we accomplished with data analytics in fiscal 2023. We're well on our way here, and our efforts are starting to bear fruit especially for the Zevex marketplace.\r\n Another important story this quarter relates to maturing our product development organization to drive innovation to accelerate product diversification and consolidate resources to ensure long-term success to that end, we have assembled an all-star team of seasoned gaming experts who are alumni of the leading mobile gaming publishers and have turned them loose on shots.\r\n Their mandate is to unleash the growth that was core to our investment thesis at the time of the acquisition. This team is already sprinting having overhauled the product roadmap with four major focus areas. The first is teacher development, which hasn't been given the attention it deserves since the acquisition in the past, successful new features would yield a 10% to 30% jump in revenues with little or no downside when they didn't take hold. The updated product roadmap is full of new features designed to drive revenue and make guru shots more accessible to an even broader audience.\r\n Next, our decision to focus on innovation will allow us to drive user growth by investing our marketing dollars more efficiently. Specifically, we will better a couple grew chasses UA spend with feature releases. In January, we introduced turbo feature that expands the gameplay and improves game resource consumption.\r\n To date, it has yielded a 15% increase in average daily revenue, giving me confidence that we are on the right track. Traditionally, we are about to release another new feature flash challenges, a short duration photo challenge that limits the number of participants per challenge and provides even more opportunities for users to win. We believe that this dynamic will drive up engagement to make food shops more accessible to a broader set of players, both existing and new.\r\n In parallel, the team is reinventing the game economy by converting to a coin based economy supporting multiple currencies and foregoing the existing autonomy, which we believe is too rigid and limited in terms of the number of ways players can earn and spend in-game resources. This change will open an array of customer value ads.\r\n For example, we will be able to reward all players with game currency and manage resource consumption in a fashion that optimizes further coin purchases, creating a comprehensive and inviting on-boarding funnel is also a key focus area for the grooming shops, game insured onboarding will enable newbies to immediately experience gameplay in a simplified manner with a limited number of competitors increasing their chances of winning the funnel will allow players to progress with more features and increased complexity based on individual performance, enabling skill-based user segmentation, which will be a win for the user base.\r\n I want to add that we believe these efforts taken in concert with one another will help us deliver growth, which was one of the key theses of the acquisition through shots is the leading photo competition game and more than 150 million photos have been used to play. The game photography continues growing exponentially due to the ubiquity of mobile phones and with the advent of AI enhancements, high quality pictures are within everyone's reach.\r\n The gameplay is fine and it touches on the human interface. Safety for people like to have fun, compete and win with all the opportunities we have in the pipeline. I think we are at a turning point and I look forward to sharing details as they unfold.\r\n Moving to the Zedge marketplace our success in growing advertising revenue in recent quarters stems from our continuous optimization efforts, combined with highly effective paid UA programs are driving positive roll offs in 90 days or less Additionally, over the past two quarters, we began improving our IOS monetization stack by optimizing ads and rolling out Zedge plus for IOS, which, along with paint contributed to strong iOS revenue growth.\r\n Overall, the iOS ecosystem remains a largely untapped opportunity for us, and we continuously look at ways most recently AI to unlock it and capitalize on our brand to drive growth motor PTO had another good quarter. Our previous investments in website redesign, localization and technology upgrades continued to pay off and lay the foundation for the next phase of growth with new features and content expected to be rolled out in the quarters to come.\r\n Taken together, we continue to believe that we have never been in a better position to create sustainable long-term profitable growth given the combination of market opportunity, our current product portfolio and roadmap, our marketing prowess, data capabilities, tech stack, and most importantly, our team. Furthermore, we are not just talking about AI. We have already integrated it throughout our business, including product technology and marketing.\r\n And now I would like to turn the call over to Yi, who will review our financial results. Yi?\n\nStory continues\n\nYi Tsai\n\nYes. Thank you, Jonathan. As you saw in our earnings release, GAAP requires us to take a one-time $11.9 million non-cash write-down of goodwill charges, intangible asset. It's important to underscore that this was a non-cash event dictated by time as current performance demand line with a carrying value in the loan book. As Jonathan indicated, we still believe that with time, we will unlock growth and achieve the strategic goals that we envisioned when we acquire closure.\r\n Additionally, this write-down does not reflect the valuable gamification experience we secure benefiting the rest of our business as a result of the strain related to variation. Over the past year, we have added non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as new metrics that we plan to report going forward. The reconciliation for GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our earnings release from this morning.\r\n Monthly active users on now for the debt marketplace decreased 10.7% from a year ago to $28.8 million. Now in well developed market and emerging market were down 15.6% and 9.2%, respectively. Total revenue in the second quarter was $7.8 million, up 11% from last year due to the goods and services, which encompasses revenue from Korea, came in at $0.9 million, down 26% from last year.\r\n Similar to Q1, GuruShots revenue was again negatively impacted by Apple's ATT framework, macro economic issues and the geopolitical situations. Subscription revenue for the second quarter was up 24% versus last year. Additionally, this metric was up sequentially for the third straight quarter as our net active subscriber trend improved and higher-value IOS attrition and our new value add exist Plus offering for Android replace lower cost legacy subscription, which only remove it net premiums.\r\n Gross transaction value or GTV, grew 23% from last year to a record $540,000, reflecting higher price per advertising impression and incremental revenue generated from payments, which offset modest decline in other content sales. It was a record [$0.072], up 37% year over year, reflecting stability in our pricing and a positive impact of our new IOS Android.\r\n Subscription cost of revenue declined by 27% and was 5.9% of revenue. SG&A increased by 11% to $6.5 million. GAAP loss from operation, including the impact of the $11.9 million write off was $11.9 million versus income from operation of $1.5 million last year. GAAP net loss and loss per share for Q2 was $9.2 million or $0.66 versus income and EPS of $1.6 million and $0.11, respectively in a prior year.\r\n Non-gaap net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.5 million and $0.04 versus $0.8 million and $0.06 in the prior year, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million versus $1.4 million in the prior year. From a liquidity standpoint, we remain in a strong cash position with over $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, not every pay down the $2 million in outstanding bank loan during the quarter.\r\n Thank you for listening to our second quarter earnings call. And I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in mid June. Operator, back to you for Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Allen Klee, Maxim Group.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nCongratulations on the strong revenue growth from my first question is you had record advertising rates, but it's also your seasonally strongest quarter, I think. So. Can we parse out how to think about maybe to some degree what effect is seasonal versus the other stuff?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nHi, Allen. Thanks so much for your comments. And as I mentioned in my earlier summary of the quarter, we're actually seeing that our comm halfway through the quarter numbers are holding up. So that is due to a combination of factors, both speaker wise as tech winds or ad stack was high as well as I guess, some secular features or some such secular factors. So it's a little bit hard to sort of parse that out because by contrast typically our Q3 is our weakest quarter from an ad revenue perspective in light of post season drop-off in ad budgets and so on and so forth.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nThat's great. Thank you. And then just, in terms of the marketplace, I think you said that paint and there's greater functionality on the web and gross transactional value sold was up like 23%. Is there a way to think about what the key drivers are of them have growth in marketplace and things that you're doing keep us going?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nSure. Just to be more specific, are you talking about Zedge Premium? Are you talking about the overall marketplace, which includes not only licensed content but also user-generated content?\n\nAllen Klee\n\nFor both.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nWell, right. When you take a look at Zedge Premium, which is the licensed content area. We continue to iterate Teun Optimiz. And as a result, you're seeing the improvements there. We are also and now beginning to think about what can that market, what converged premium look like with the expansion across web and in terms of the overall Zedge app are global in that marketplace it's a function of continually adding and optimizing features that we have as well as improving the user experience.\r\n There's work that can be done on the user experience. One of the areas that we're beginning to look into now relates to us onboarding. In the past, we've talked about our recommendations on the content that served up to users. How does that impact on the user experience and then projects around improving engagement and retention.\r\n So in our totality, each of those contributes up to the results that we reported today and then separate and apart from that, as I mentioned, the work that we had done last year in terms of overhauling the Zedge plus subscription on Android and rolling out Z plus subscription on IOS for the first time, it has also yielded very positive results for us.\n\nAllen Klee\n\n(multiple speakers) Yes. Thank you, Al. Just so we understand, is it Zedge plus is Zedge marketplace subscription and you also get another different type of subscription just for being ad free for, are they the same and then your paid subscribers were flat sequentially do you think that that number can can continue to grow sequentially? Thank you.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nSo that plus is our subscription offering. Our subscription offering has a bundle together. Several value adds up one of those value adds, is it free as you described it, but then if there are additional value adds in there, whether it be both that can be used for creating a I images ahm as an example. And insofar as a potential growth of number of subscribers, our aspiration is clearly to see to it that that subscription number grows over time and there is ongoing work with respect to how to make that subscription offering, whether it be on Android or on IOS even more attractive.\r\n If I were to provide a metaphor when you think about Amazon. So Amazon has overnight delivery, but they also offer a wealth of other value ads, whether it be content, whether it be storage and so on. And so forth. And as I said, as a metaphor, that is the work that we are heavily invested in terms of saying to us that we can continue to make the subscription offering even more attractive than what exists today.\r\n And going back to the overhaul that we had introduced in 2023, that was a lot of improvements in terms of those value adds, making that subscription offering more attractive and ultimately bringing in new subscribers.\n\nYi Tsai\n\nThank you. In terms of a major TV, I don't know if you've provided any numbers in terms of did it grow over year over year as a result, I'm not sure if you're able to provide revenue also, you said the new actions you'd like to add mentioned some things like emoji mash-ups, emotive times, and I'm probably saying around KO. emojis.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nCould you just tell me what mash-ups and payer markets are saying, I'm sure these are new content just to keep it simple, these are new content forms. But by way of example, on when today, one renders a smiley emoji and they can either have a smiley face in yellow and so on and so forth or they can type of coal and a closed frenzy.\r\n That is a contrast with the text strings that connote a various messages are, and that is a potential direction for us to add as a new content vertical within a motor PDR. And that's one of many in terms of numbers, I'm going to hand off to you to answer your question, Alan.\n\nYi Tsai\n\nSo he moved to PDR. The second quarter call was not as great as we had hoped for. But if you look at the six months, we still grew that 27%. For three months ended January, we only grew about 8%.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nThank you. And then one of the areas that I think you mentioned as a priority is on monthly trying to grow monthly active users that was up slightly sequentially, which which is encouraging. Pat, could you maybe just highlight some of the key things you're focused on to get that number to start growing again?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nSure. So we have a couple of activities that are taking place. We put together what I'll call a task force of rank and file their complaints with out a management participation that are working on some various feature enhancements, new features and potentially complementary products that would unlock growth.\r\n And then separately, we are also looking at ways of reimagining are they Zedge app or benefiting from the installed base that we have got to help fuel additional growth, whether that be through product marketing, incentive plans, influencer type of job of end referral plans.\r\n And then, of course, separate and apart from that on user acquisition investments and all of those taken together, we we are hoping that we can reverse that trend and see to it that we unlock what we believe to be on a promising growth opportunities on an annual escalator at.\n\nYi Tsai\n\nSo I would just like to, as we mentioned, even though our active subscribers stayed flat at 648,000, but we are replacing low value solution with a higher value from the lifetime subscription as well as suppressing. So although the active subscribers remain the same, but our revenue base, what's much higher?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nThank you.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nA yes, that's a good point. Thank you. Then on through Charles City, a couple of questions. My personal experience, and I'm a bad example, not being that savvy in this stuff, but on it's hard to be a newbie to when you first get on, it seems difficult to know how to engage, you know, and it tells you, you know, you can engage in a bunch of things until you get to a certain level.\r\n So maybe what you're doing to change that. And then also talk a little about what the the turbo feature, what that actually is and the new feature you're going to add and then why multiple virtual currencies some should help you out. Thanks.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nThank you, Allen. And a point very well taken with respect to onboarding, as you said, a newbie that downloads good shots today, it is immediately immerse in the full game as they enter into a competition, they can be competing against up to 7,000 other photographers that are in that our competition with a dashboard that has a lot of numbers and features to it. So a user has to be exceptionally loyal and very, very insistent on saying they're going to figure this thing out.\r\n Our overhauling onboarding will allow for us too simplify the game plan such that we get users into that funnel immediately, which opens up the top of the funnel, hopefully expand for plate, the potential player base and also allows for folks that may think that they are not good photographers, making this accessible to them. And then with progression as users begin to master skills and so on and so forth, they will then gain again, exposure to additional features.\r\n Our that contribute to making in-play more competitive and fun and so on and so forth. In addition to that, the onboarding will on have an element to it to that makes the game more or I guess, shorter in duration. So a typical photo challenge today, Inder shops can range in duration from one to several days. The notion of going through that onboarding feature will be to decrease that to you know, it could be 30 minutes.\r\n It could be an hour or it could be two hours and so on and so forth with respect to our changing the economy. The economy today is a rigid economy. There are three game resources that users can benefit from while playing the game and the way to access those game resources is through a hard in-app purchase event.\r\n If you buy resource A., it does not have any relevance to resource BOC to master the game. You really need to have a portfolio of those three resources and migrating to a coin based on economy, which has multiple currencies allows for a lot more flexibility. And it also allows for us to some reward every player in the game.\r\n Meaning if you are playing a game today and you don't come in first, second or third place, that means you don't feel that great about yourself, even though you may have come in for which is 6,996 in terms of your ranking, our ability will be with this new our Coinbase economy proceeded with the every player, even a player that ranks lowest of those 7,000, we'll be able to get a reward and ultimately use that reward in one way, shape form or another or use those rewards in order to potentially gain an edge.\r\n With respect to game resources, as I mentioned during my comments, we've made changes to the product team and the product team is now very, very well resourced with a community of product managers that come out of some of the most well-known global gaming companies that have experienced not only in a gaming design, user experience, user interface, but also in gaming economies and what can be done in order to optimize those economies, ultimately leading to better revenue generation as well as contributing to improving user engagement and user retention in totality.\r\n Our hope and expectation is that taken together that will unlock the growth that we believe is inherent in this asset in terms of content, the new features, the new features most immediately are around offering what I will call mini game battles for users that are already in the middle of the game and then and now beginning to expand that too, and just being a standalone short term, limited number of competitors type of battle.\r\n Again, allowing for this to be a quick win for users to get that dopamine flow and feel like, wow, they're competing in real time without having to wait for an extended period of time in order to ultimately win a battle. And in addition to that, also decreasing the number of people that they're competing against, therefore increasing the chances that they can actually win. And again, that escalated accordingly. Does that answer your question?\n\nAllen Klee\n\nNo, that was very thorough. Thank you. From just some updates on AI. heart Master, can you provide an update on that?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nSure. So a master remains in soft launch. So we made the decision to keep it in soft launch. While we are hard at work at unlocking the growth in the core guru shots game and we continue to gather data. Our plan currently is that when we get to crew change its trajectory and the direction and that we believe will allow for this growth that we will then refocus efforts and resources on AIR. master.\r\n We just don't want to spread ourselves so thinly that were not progressing the GURU shouts game and that as we evolve, it will take time to watch this AR master game as we iterate and so on and so forth. So focusing on getting one thing gone really, really well and then progressing to the next thing, which would be a our master or master now is at a point where we are able to monitor the data. That data is going to be exceptionally valuable in terms of helping guide what our future direction is with that game and how it evolves.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nGot you. Okay. And then probably I'm guessing a similar answer answer from the past call, you talked about potentially launching hybrid casual game. Is that kind of in the same status or --\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nAI. art Master is in that hybrid casual category those those are not separate and distinct from one another.\n\nAllen Klee\n\nOkay, got it. Thank you on. Okay. And then, um, question on financials. The jump in SG&A for the quarter is the ways I look at that. To what degree do we think of that as like on finance that this is a seasonally strong quarter versus some of the other things you talked about perhaps a good acquisition or some of the new well, it's ISG. and you brought on some more people. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of it is maybe seasonal versus revenue run rate for SG&A?\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nI would actually reframe that a little bit. SG&A includes marketing. So there are two components of that number one is actual money that we have spent on paid user acquisition, as I've said in the past, in order to scale paid user acquisition, when looking at budgets, there is going to be steady state on this platform. This particular campaign works. We continue investing in it, but there is obviously a ceiling there.\r\n And then there is what we'll call test budgets for you trying new platform, you're trying new creatives and stuff like that and some of that stuff works. Some of that does not need both components in order to scale pay user acquisition. But then there is also the fee that we pay to, whether it be Apple or Google when we bring on a subscriber or when a user makes an in-app purchase.\r\n So those two components taken together contributed materially to the increase in SG&A. And the way I sort of look at it is if we're successful in growing our subscriber base. If we're successful in generating more in-app purchases, SG&A goes up, that's actually a good reason for SG&A to go up as opposed to. We're not managing our expense for infrastructure properly minute By way of contrast, EVM, anything that you want to add to that.\n\nYi Tsai\n\nBut yes, I'll only add a pattern of FT. remain quite stable in all net compensation expenses to be in line with last year. So all the increase in exiting a Jonathan mentioned is in the marketing spend and also the pipeline we see one of the downside than we were a lifetime subscription runs from Google Play's point of view, it's just one and done. So they traded at a in their purchase just so we pay a 30% fee rather than a vigorous appreciating, which is at 15% fee. So as a result on our platform fee went up by virtue of our rolling out a lifetime subscription?\n\nAllen Klee\n\nGreat. Okay. Congrats again and thank you so much.\n\nBrian Siegel\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude our question and answer session and the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Value investing has long been a popular and successful style of investing. Essentially, value investors will search for stocks that appear to be trading for less than what the company should be valued at. This means that they can pay less for a company than what it should be prices and value investors thus look for “deals” in the market. Each investor will have their metrics to value a company. Some measures include price multiples like the P/E ratio of P/S ratio as well as factoring in relative value to industry peers.\n\nBut at its simplest level, value investing can be as easy as basic as identifying which stocks have lagged others, especially during a bull market rally like we’ve seen in 2024. Finding these undervalued stocks while others are chasing higher multiples is a great way to pivot from crowded trades. Here are three undervalued large-cap stocks that can perform well in March.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a company that truly needs no introduction. For years it has been the world’s most valuable company until a quarter of poor performance to start 2024 has deflated its value. According to Yahoo! Finance, 39 financial analysts cover the stock with a one-year price target range of $158.00 to $250.00. The average price target of $201.41 is about $30.00 higher than Apple’s current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple’s revenues were so high, it was nearly impossible to maintain its growth. Until last quarter, Apple had suffered from four consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines. But there is hope for the bulls. Apple has abandoned its electric car plans and focused the team on generative AI. Expect a major AI announcement at some point this year from Apple.\n\nApple’s stock now trades at 26x forward earnings which is cheaper than other big tech stocks like Amazon or Tesla. It also trades at about 25x free cash flow. Both metrics are slightly higher than the historical average for the stock. The gross margin remains strong at about 45% and this should continue to improve as Apple moves more towards software services.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks Corporation (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is an American multinational coffee and beverage company founded in 1971 in Seattle, Washington. As per Yahoo! Finance, 29 financial analysts cover this stock with a one-year price target range of $95.00 to $127.00. The average price target is $106.60 or about $15.00 more than the current price of SBUX.\n\nYou might be surprised to see that Starbucks is currently trading below the lowest analyst price target for the stock. It’s been a tough year for shareholders as SBUX is down by nearly 3.0% in 2024 and more than 8.0% over the past 52 weeks. The sell-off for Starbucks has been aggressive, especially considering revenue for the fiscal year 2023 was up by 12% from 2022. On top of that, management continues to open stores around the world and expects to open 15,000 new stores by 2030. This would bring its global footprint to 55,000 locations.\n\nThe sell-off in SBUX has the stock trading at its lowest price multiples in years. Shares are trading at just 22.3x forward earnings and 2.8x TTM sales. This management team continues to execute and has grown revenue by 45% over the past five years.\n\nSnowflake Inc (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) is an American cloud-computing company that was founded in 2012 and based in Montana. It’s been a volatile few months for Snowflake shareholders and that is reflected in the price targets for the stock. As per Yahoo! Finance, the stock has an average one-year price target of $217.05 which is about $55.00 more than the current price.\n\nShares took a beating in February when the company announced its quarterly earnings. Not only did Snowflake provide poor guidance but the CEO suddenly retired. As you probably know, these two things are not looked at kindly by shareholders or Wall Street. Revenue growth is decelerating as the company matures which is another reason why the stock has fallen so hard.\n\nWith a company like SNOW, the stock is always going to trade at a high valuation. Even after the decline, SNOW trades at 19x sales and 204x forward earnings. One thing to focus on for subscription-based businesses is the net revenue retention. This is how much revenue you can add to your existing customer base each year. Snowflake’s is an impressive 131% with 691 Forbes Global 2000 customers. After a relentless sell-off following earnings, Snowflake is positioned to rebound in March.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Norfolk County Council has secured a settlement in a lawsuit against Apple, with the tech giant agreeing to pay 490 million dollars (£384 million) in a “tremendous result”.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook misled investors about iPhone sales in China between November 2018 and January the following year.\n\nThe preliminary settlement filed in the US District Court in Oakland, northern California, will need final approval from a judge at a further hearing.\n\nThe class action – made on behalf of a group of claimants including investors in Apple – was led by Norfolk Council, which said its pension fund was affected by the company’s alleged actions. Tim Cook is alleged to have misled investors (Doug Peters/PA)\n\nA spokesperson for the Norfolk Pension Fund said: “We are proud of this recovery for investors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We are mindful that we are stewards of pensions relied upon by thousands of families and individuals.\n\n“When and where it’s warranted, we will take decisive action to recover losses when our participants’ investments are harmed by fraud.”\n\nThe Oakland court’s judgment said: “The settlement is a tremendous result for the class.”\n\nAccording to the document, Norfolk Council became the “lead plaintiff” in June 2020 and alleged that Apple “made materially false and misleading statements and omissions about demand for the newly-released iPhones and Apple’s business in China” contrary to the Securities Exchange Act 1934.\n\nThe complaint further alleged “false and misleading statements and omissions” caused Apple’s stock to trade at “artificially inflated prices” before the stock price declined when the “true facts” were disclosed.\n\nMr Cook indicated during an investor conference call in November 2018 that iPhone sales in China were performing well, according to the complaint.\n\nIn January the following year, the chief executive warned Apple’s revenue for the quarter would drop nine billion dollars (£7.09 billion) below what was predicted – with almost all of the fall found to be down to poor demand in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt led to the company’s stock price diving 10% in the next day of frenetic trading and cut shareholder wealth by more than 70 billion dollars (£55 billion).\n\nApple denied Mr Cook deceived investors about the phone’s sales in China in that period.\n\n“Defendants (Apple) have expressly denied and continue to deny that they have violated the federal securities laws or any other laws, or have otherwise misled investors as alleged in this action,” the Oakland judgment made clear.\n\n“But in recognition that further litigation will be protracted, overly burdensome, expensive and distracting have determined that it is desirable and beneficial for them to resolve the action.”\n\nThe parties accepted a mediator’s proposal to settle on March 1.\n\nNorfolk Council will receive a portion of the settlement.\n\nApple recorded 97 billion dollars (£76 billion) in profit in its last fiscal year. The 490 million-dollar payment is less than 1% of that figure.\n\nApple has been approached for comment.",

        "content": "Apple has agreed to pay $490 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging CEO Tim Cook misled investors about a steep downturn in iPhone's sales in China that culminated in a jarring revision to the company's revenue forecast.\n\nThe preliminary settlement filed Friday in Oakland, California, federal court stems from a shareholder lawsuit focused on the way Apple relayed information about how iPhone models released in September 2018 were performing in China, one of the company's biggest markets.\n\nCook signaled that the new iPhones were off to a good start during an investor conference call in early November 2018, according to the complaint.\n\nThat reassurance dissolved into a huge letdown on Jan. 2, 2019 when the Cook issued a warning that Apple's revenue for the just-completed quarter would fall $9 billion below management's forecast for the period. What's more, virtually all of the sales drop was traced to weak demand in China.\n\nIt marked the first time Apple had cut its revenue guidance since the iPhone's release in 2007 and triggered its stock price to plunge 10% in the next day of frenetic trading, wiping out more than $70 billion in shareholder wealth.\n\nApple vehemently denied Cook deceived investors about the iPhone's sales in China between early November and early January. The Cupertino, California, company maintained that stance in the settlement documents, but said it decided to make the payment after more than four years of legal wrangling to avoid an “overly burdensome, expensive, and distracting” hassle.\n\nThe settlement was reached through a mediator after U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Apple's request to dismiss the case and set a Sept. 9 trial date.\n\nGonzalez Rogers is now being asked to approve the settlement in a hearing scheduled for April 30.\n\nThousands of shareholders who bought Apple stock in late 2018 could be eligible for a piece of the settlement, which will be distributed from of a pool that will be less than $490 million after lawyers involved in the case are paid. The attorneys plan to seek up to one-fourth, or about $122 million, of the settlement.\n\nThe $490 million payment represents less than 1% of the $97 billion profit that Apple pocketed during its last fiscal year ended in September. Apple shareholders who have held on to their shares have become wealthier too. Apple's stock price has more than quadrupled from where it stood after Cook's China warning, creating an additional $2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",

        "content": "A selection of Enfa products on sale in Manhattan - Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nConsumer goods giant Reckitt has suffered a £7bn share price slump after it lost a US legal case claiming its baby formula contributed to the death of a premature child.\n\nLondon-listed Reckitt’s share price plunged by the most in two decades and to its lowest point in more than a decade after an Illinois jury ruled Reckitt had failed to warn about the risks of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) from its milk-based Enfamil brand products.\n\nNEC is an illness that damages the stomach and tends to affect premature babies. Reckitt’s US subsidiary Mead Johnson Nutrition had been sued by Jasmine Watson, who claimed the baby formula caused the death of her premature baby.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFTSE 100-constituent Reckitt has now been ordered to pay Ms Watson $60m (£47m) after losing the case.\n\nAshley Keller, a lawyer for Ms Watson, said: “The jury’s finding confirms what Mead Johnson folks already knew – that its formula dramatically increases the NEC risk   “This is the first verdict in the US, but won’t be the last, unless baby formula makers accept responsibility for their misdeeds.”\n\nNews of the decision sparked a near 20pc plunge in Reckitt’s share price, wiping around £7.3bn ($9.3bn) from its market value.\n\nIt comes amid hundreds of US lawsuits against formula makers over NEC. The Illinois case was the first to go to a jury trial.\n\nShares in Abbott Laboratories, another formula maker facing legal claims, fell almost 5pc. Jurors took less than two hours to decide that Mead Johnson should pay $60m in compensatory damages. Mr Keller said: “We only asked for $25m, but the jury came back with more than double that.”\n\nMore than 400 suits targeting Mead Johnson and Abbott are consolidated before a federal judge in Chicago for pre-trial information exchanges. The judge hasn’t yet scheduled a trial. Thousands of other suits are pending in state courts, Mr Keller said.   Reckitt continues to insist its products are safe and not linked to NEC. It has vowed to appeal the Illinois case.\n\nStory continues\n\nNEC has a fatality rate of as much as 40pc. It is a major cause of death among premature babies, though rarely occurs in full-term babies.\n\nThe disease, which affects intestinal tissues, can be hard to diagnose. According to the NHS, symptoms can include general signs of illness, problems feeding or vomiting, and a swollen and tender abdomen.\n\nWhile it has a high fatality rate, it can be treated with intravenous feeding and antibiotics. In some cases it can require surgery.\n\nReckitt said in a stock market update that it stands by the safety of its products and “strongly rejects any assertion that any of our products cause NEC”.\n\nThe company added: “It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.\n\n“This case, and others like it, exclusively involve products used under the strict supervision of neonatologists in neonatal intensive care units and provide lifesaving nutrition options for vulnerable premature infants.\n\n“We are, of course, surprised and deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned.”\n\nReckitt is one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, pulling in revenues of £14.6bn in 2023. As well as Enfamil, it makes products such as Durex condoms, Cillit Bang cleaning fluid and Gaviscon.\n\nNutrition brands account for about 16pc of its sales, contributing £2.4bn to its turnover last year.\n\nNews of the Illinois jury’s decision marks the latest in a series of blows for the company, which last month revealed a £55m hit to revenues caused by an accounting controversy in the Middle East.\n\nKris Licht, chief executive at Reckitt, said the company had unearthed “some commercial practices that we weren’t particularly pleased with”, leading to the dismissal of a number of employees.\n\nReckitt in January recalled two baby formula products from sale in the UK amid concerns they could contain dangerous bacteria, in an event unrelated to the case in the US.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:06 PM GMT\n\nThat’s all for today...\n\nThanks for joining us on the blog today.

Matt Oliver reports:\n\nThe British engineering giant on Friday said it would increase its assembly, testing and shop capacity, to meet demand for its large engines and improve maintenance for those already in service.\n\nOver the rest of this decade, the company predicts the number of aircraft using its Trent family of turbofan engines to grow by as much as 9pc annually.\n\nAs a result, Rolls is investing £55m and hiring 300 frontline workers to boost its operations in Derby and Dahlewitz, in Germany.\n\nAbout half of the investment and two thirds of the jobs will go to Derby, the company said.\n\nIt will be used to expand the number of engines the company’s factory there can deliver per year by 40pc from 2025, while also increasing the number of engines that can undergo maintenance.\n\nMeanwhile, Rolls will take advantage of existing engine testing capabilities in Dahlewitz to temporarily meet extra maintenance demands before switching to assemble and test new Trent XWB-84 engines from 2026.\n\nIt comes after the company vowed to invest £1bn in improvements to the Trent engine family.\n\nLast month Rolls revealed sales of its large aeroplane engines had surged to their highest level in 15 years.

They added:\n\nThe selection of nine leading specialist contractors ... is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK’s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUp to two million tonnes of CO2 would be captured annually before being transported and securely stored in subsea sites beneath the North Sea.\n\nCompanies awarded contracts included energy group Shell and infrastructure specialists Balfour Beatty.\n\nFriday’s announcement comes after Rishi Sunak’s administration this week pledged to build new gas-fired power stations to boost energy security.\n\nAt the same time, the UK is rolling out low-carbon energies such as nuclear, solar and wind power in a strategy to combat sky-high domestic electricity and gas bills, which rocketed after key producer Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.\n\n04:22 PM GMT\n\nReckitt Benckiser plunges after infant formula verdict\n\nDettol maker Reckitt Benckiser has fallen 17pc this afternoon. It followed an Illinois jury ordering the company’s Mead Johnson division to pay $60m (£47m) to the mother of a premature baby who died of an intestinal disease after being fed the company’s Enfamil baby formula.\n\nShares plunged on fears that the consumer goods company would face more financial liabilities from lawsuits related to the baby formula.\n\nReckitt told investors that it strongly disagreed with the jury’s decision.\n\nIt said:\n\nWe continue to believe that the allegations from the plaintiff’s lawyers in this case were not supported by the science or experts in the medical community … It is important to note that this is a single verdict in a single case and should not be extrapolated.\n\nReckitt added that it was “deeply disappointed with the verdict and will pursue all options to have it overturned”.\n\nSusannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\n\nIt’s not simply the size of this payout which has caused nervousness, but the fact a long line of other lawsuits are pending, which could mount up to be a huge sum for the company.\n\n04:19 PM GMT\n\nActivist investor Oasis builds stake in Britain’s biggest sandwich maker\n\nA Hong Kong-based activist investor has built up shares in Britain’s biggest sandwich maker after its share price fell by almost 50pc in the last five years. Daniel Woolfson reports:\n\nOasis Management has acquired almost 5pc of the shares in Greencore, a major supplier of sandwiches and ready meals to the UK’s major supermarkets.\n\nGreencore produces 779m sandwiches a year and supplies Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.\n\nAs well as sandwiches, it makes sushi, soups, packaged ready-meals and other chilled supermarket products. It employs around 13,600 people across the UK.\n\nIts shares have been languishing since the pandemic, falling more than 45pc over the last five years.\n\nOasis has waged shareholder campaigns at a number of prominent consumer companies over recent years.\n\nA stake of almost 5pc of the company would make Oasis one of Greencore’s largest shareholders.

The output of manufacturing rose 0.8% and mining rose 2.2%. Both reflect a rebound from the weather-induced declines in January.

Nissan president and chief executive Makoto Uchida announced the agreement alongside Honda president and director Toshihiro Mibe - PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty Images\n\n07:18 AM GMT\n\nBarratt’s £2.5bn deal to buy Redrow faces investigation from competition watchdog\n\nThe competition watchdog has launched an investigation into a £2.5bn merger between two of Britain’s biggest house builders.\n\nBarratt Developments, the country’s largest housebuilder, announced plans last month to buy competitor Redrow in a deal that will allow the combined company to build around 22,000 homes each year.\n\nHowever, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has revealed it is investigating whether the deal may “result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services”.\n\nBoth housebuilders are now facing two separate inquiries by the regulator after the CMA last month opened an investigation looking at suspected illegal information sharing between Britain’s biggest housebuilders amid fears that collusion in the industry has pushed up prices.\n\nThe watchdog will investigate the practices of Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley, Bloor Homes, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey, and Vistry.\n\nThe CMA today issued an invitation for comments on Barratt Developments’ proposed £2.5bn takeover of Redrow.\n\nInterested parties have until April 2 to submit their views before the regulator begins the next phase of its inquiry. Barratt's £2.5bn takeover of Redrow will be investigated by the competition regulator - REUTERS/Paul Childs\n\n07:12 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. A £2.5bn merger between housebuilders Barratt and Redrow will be investigated by the competition regulator.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority has announced it will examine the tie up, which will build create a company that builds around 22,000 homes each year.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Ageing Whitehall computer systems threaten to wreck hopes of AI revolution, says watchdog | Inefficient and risky Government IT systems could derail attempts to use artificial intelligence\n\n2) Why John Lewis went back to basics in the battle to recover its mojo | The partnership is injecting new life into its tired stores as it finally returns to profit\n\n3) Two-thirds of sickness benefit claimants never have to find a job | 1.5m applying for Universal Credit-linked benefits granted most generous welfare payments\n\n4) Ministers push back on new telegraph poles after broadband roll-out sparks anger | Rapid deployment of infrastructure for new networks leading to ‘blot on the landscape’\n\n5) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: Labour economists see rising recession danger in the US | Climbing unemployment is pushing America’s economy perilously close to the edge\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian markets retreated, with Hong Kong’s benchmark falling nearly 2pc, after a mixed batch of data on the US economy dashed hopes that easier interest rates are coming soon.\n\nTokyo’s Nikkei 225 declined 0.3pc to 38,707.64, while the Kospi in South Korea sank 1.9pc to 2,666.84.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.7pc at 16,676.70 after reports said housing prices have continued to fall since February.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index gained 0.3pc to 3,055.16, while the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.9pc to 7,670.30.\n\nUS stocks slipped yesterday after a mixed batch of economic data seemed dampened hopes that easier interest rates will arrive quickly.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3pc, to 5,150.48, though it’s still close to its all-time high set on Tuesday.

Lawyers disclosed the proposed settlement in a request for approval filed with the US District Court in Northern California on Friday.\n\nThe settlement comes as Apple continues to face headwinds in China. The company’s iPhone sales in the Asian nation fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to independent research released earlier this month.

        "content": "The new sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA) just found its new CEO: former Apple and Hulu executive Pete Distad.\n\nDistad, who most recently served as an executive at Apple (AAPL) for a decade following six years at Disney's Hulu, will assume oversight of all aspects of the joint venture, including overall strategy, distribution, marketing, and sales, according to a press release.\n\nThe streaming service, announced last month, is set to debut sometime this fall and comes at a time when media companies are facing increased pressure from investors to scale their platforms and achieve profitability.\n\nThe unnamed platform will bring together the three companies' respective slates of sports networks. Collectively, the new service encompasses about 55% of US sports rights, according to Citi Research.\n\n\"Pete is an accomplished innovator and leader who has extensive experience with launching and growing new video services,\" the three companies said in a joint statement. \"We are confident he and his team will build an extremely compelling, fan-focused product for our target market.\"\n\nWhile at Apple, Distad was responsible for the business, operations and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts, including the launch of streaming service Apple TV+.\n\nNotably, he helped scale the fledgling platform as it worked to compete with more established players. He was also involved in Apple's eventual $2.5 billion acquisition of MLS season pass in 2022.\n\n\"This is an incredible opportunity to build and grow a differentiated product that will serve passionate sports fans in the US outside of the traditional pay TV bundle,\" Distad said in the release. \"I’m excited to be able to pull together the industry-leading sports content portfolios from these three companies to deliver a new best-in-class service.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said the service will be priced on the higher end of estimates with subscribers expected to hit around 5 million by 2029. Wall Street has estimated the price point will come in between $40 to $50 a month.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo note, the companies have yet to reveal when they will release exact pricing information.

        "title": "Here Are All 7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street's flagship index, the S&P 500. Since taking the reins as CEO, the aptly dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of 4,927,141%, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024. That compares to a total return, including dividends paid, of around 33,500% for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nRiding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a moneymaking strategy for decades, which is made all the easier thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors are buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for money managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management.\n\nAlthough most investors are intrigued to see what the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying, understanding why Buffett and his team are selling certain stocks can be just as insightful.\n\nBased on Berkshire's most recent 13F, Warren Buffett and his team are selling seven stocks. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Paramount Global: 30,408,484 shares sold (63,322,491 shares remaining)\n\nThe first sizable holding that found itself on the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is media companyParamount Global(NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett's company pared down nearly a third of its position, which had stood at north of 93 million shares.\n\nThe catalyst for dumping more than 30 million shares looks to be Paramount's undesirable balance sheet. More specifically, the company is lugging around $14.6 billion in long-term debt, compared to just $2.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of the end of 2023. With cord-cutting ongoing and Paramount's streaming segment still losing money, investors (including Buffett) have begun to lose patience.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other side of the coin is that Paramount's streaming segment losses are lessening thanks to higher subscription prices being passed along to users. Further, legacy media companies tend to enjoy a resurgence in ad spending during major election years. Although Paramount Global clearly has concerns to address, things may not be as dire as its poor stock performance would suggest.\n\n2. HP: 79,666,320 shares sold (22,852,715 shares remaining)\n\nAnother high-profile name that took a big haircut in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio during the fourth quarter is personal computing and printing services provider HP(NYSE: HPQ). Buffett and his aides dumped close to 78% of Berkshire's stake, compared to what was held on Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nThe impetus behind this selling activity may have to do with the sluggishness of personal computer (PC) sales. Though PC sales surged during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they've meaningfully retraced with most employees returning to the office. With no sales growth forecast for the current year, HP's 3.6% dividend yield simply isn't enough of a lure to keep Buffett and his team interested.\n\nHP also looks like a perfect example of a \"fair company at a wonderful price\" that Buffett would prefer to avoid. Although HP stock can be purchased for a mere 8 times forward year earnings, the company's growth days are long gone. Now reliant on relatively low-margin products and printing services, HP lacks the needle-moving results Berkshire's brightest minds desire.\n\n3. Apple: 10,000,382 shares sold (905,560,000 shares remaining)\n\nPerhaps the most surprising selling activity during the fourth quarter was the roughly 10 million shares Buffett and his investing \"lieutenants\" parted ways with in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Keep in mind that selling 10 million shares only reduced Berkshire's stake in its top holding by 1.1%.\n\nChances are the Oracle of Omaha hasn't changed his tune on what he previously referred to as \"a better business than any we own.\" Apple's physical product innovation has led the way for more than a decade, with the company now also emphasizing high-margin subscription services. To boot, Apple has repurchased $650.9 billion of its own common stock since the start of 2013, which is tops among public companies.\n\nThe most logical reason Buffett and his investing crew pared down their Apple stake is to offset realized investment losses from Paramount Global and HP. Buffett's company is sitting on an estimated $119 billion in unrealized gains on its Apple stock. MKL Price to Book Value Chart\n\n4. Markel Group: 158,715 shares sold (entire position sold)\n\nA popular holding that was given the heave-ho from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter is insurance and investment company Markel Group(NYSE: MKL), which has been dubbed something of a \"mini-Berkshire\" given its penchant for making investments. Buffett and his team dumped their entire position in Markel, which had been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThere are two educated guesses as to why Markel found itself on the chopping block. The likeliest answer is valuation. Since 2015, Markel Group had traded at or below 120% of its book value on only a handful of occasions. One of those instances was during the first quarter of 2022. With Markel's premium-to-book value nearing 50% just prior to the start of October 2023, the luster of getting a \"deal\" may have worn off.\n\nThe other possibility is Weschler or Combs, not Buffett, cut Markel loose. Buffett's investment aides are considerably more active on the trading front than he is, and this position was ultimately held less than two years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. StoneCo: 10,695,448 shares sold (entire position sold)\n\nBrazil-focused fintech company StoneCo(NASDAQ: STNE), which had been a five-year holding in Berkshire's portfolio, was also shown the door during the fourth quarter.\n\nThe motivation for Buffett and his team to part ways with StoneCo probably had to do with the company's debt-driven challenges. Brazil's central bank raised interest rates to as high as 13.75% in 2022 to get the country's inflation rate under control. Unfortunately, StoneCo's loan division was backed by debt, which sent its servicing costs soaring. Even though management has addressed these issues, StoneCo is still something of a work in progress.\n\nOn the other hand, StoneCo has its fingers in far more than just payments in Brazil's economy. It offers banking and credit solutions, as well as software, to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Although add-on service adoption is climbing, StoneCo has penetrated just a small fraction of the fintech market in Brazil. GL Price to Book Value Chart\n\n6. Globe Life 831,014 shares sold (entire position sold)\n\nThe sixth stock Buffett and his team kicked to the curb during the December-ended quarter was longtime holding Globe Life(NYSE: GL). Prior to its departure, life and supplemental health insurance company Globe Life had been a continuous holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for more than two decades.\n\nValuation looks to be the most sensible reason behind Buffett & Co.'s decision to sell. Shares of the company more than doubled following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, sending its price-to-book value to nearly 300% during the fourth quarter. At no point during the 22 years that Berkshire held shares of Globe Life did it sustain a book value of more than 200% for any length of time, let alone near 300%.\n\nBuffett and his team are also known for concentrating Berkshire's investments in their top ideas. Globe Life never met the definition of a core holding, which ultimately sealed its fate.\n\n7. D.R. Horton: 5,969,714 shares sold (entire position sold)\n\nLast but not least, the Oracle of Omaha and his team booted homebuilder D.R. Horton(NYSE: DHI) from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter.\n\nThis is one of the biggest head-scratchers of all considering shares of D.R. Horton were only acquired during the June-ended quarter. Since Warren Buffett is a firm believer in holding wonderful businesses for extended periods, the purchase and subsequent sale of D.R. Horton suggests that Ted Weschler and/or Todd Combs were the masterminds behind this relatively quick trade.\n\nHistory may also have played a role in dumping shares of D.R. Horton. Homebuilders aren't known for delivering outsized investment returns. Depending on Berkshire's entry and exit, it could have been up north of 50% on its stake in D.R. Horton in under nine months. That's an incredible gain for a traditionally slow-moving, highly cyclical industry. With various money-based metrics and predictive indicators alluding to a possible recession in 2024, locking in gains may have been prudent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Paramount Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Paramount Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paramount Global wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Ranked From Cheapest to Most Expensive",
        "content": "For more than a year, Wall Street has been putting smiles on most investors' faces. Following bear market declines in 2022 for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite, all three major stock indexes have powered their way to record-closing highs in 2024.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of factors that have fed the current bull market, such as a lower inflation rate and the continued strength of the U.S. economy, much of the heavy lifting has fallen on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's most influential businesses\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most prominent businesses on the planet in terms of both aggregate sales and innovation. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from handily outperforming all three major stock indexes over long periods, the Magnificent Seven offer sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is the dominant provider of desktop operating systems (Windows) and has seen its share of global cloud infrastructure service spend jump to 25%, thanks to Azure. Apple's iPhone has accounted for around half or more of the U.S. smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable. The company has also bought back a jaw-dropping $651 billion of its own stock in 11 years. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a virtual monopoly (90%-plus share) of GPUs in use in high-compute data centers this year. Amazon leads in two categories. It's the far-and-away biggest player in e-commerce and held a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend via Amazon Web Services (AWS), as of September 2023. Alphabet's Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search, with close to 92% of worldwide share in February. Alphabet also owns the second-most-visited social site (YouTube) and the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms is the owner of Facebook, the most visited social site in the world. Collectively, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and other apps, Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users to its social media \"real estate.\" Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nWhile all seven of these components have been phenomenal long-term investments, their outlooks going forward could differ greatly -- and that all starts with their valuations.\n\nRanking the Magnificent Seven stocks from cheapest to priciest using a common valuation tool\n\nTo be upfront, analyzing the valuations of public companies can be subjective. What one investor believes is pricey, another might view as an incredible deal. Likewise, fundamental metrics are fluid and constantly changing as companies report their operating results and Wall Street analysts react to this data.\n\nNevertheless, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has stood the test of time as the most rudimentary measure of value for public companies. But since Wall Street is forward-looking, utilizing the forward P/E ratio, which takes into account consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the upcoming year, makes the most sense.\n\nBased on consensus estimates from Wall Street, as of the closing bell on March 13, here's how the Magnificent Seven ranked from cheapest to priciest using this common valuation tool:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 17.83 forward P/E ratio Meta Platforms: 21.56 Apple: 23.9 Nvidia: 30.43 Microsoft: 31.07 Amazon: 33.95 Tesla: 41.14\n\nTo offer some context, the forward P/E ratios for the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq 100 are 21.1 and 31.32, respectively.\n\nBased purely on earnings potential for the coming year, Amazon and Tesla appear relatively pricey, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms look like bargains. The latter is particularly interesting, given that Meta has more than quintupled since its 2022 bear market bottom yet remains attractively valued, based on consensus EPS estimates for the company.\n\nHowever, the forward P/E ratio doesn't provide the most complete story in terms of valuation. While it can be a helpful tool for assessing mature businesses, an even better measure of value exists for the generally faster-growing and innovation-driven Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the smartest way to rank the Magnificent Seven from cheapest to most expensive\n\nIn addition to being dominant within their respective industries, the Magnificent Seven share another trait: They tend to reinvest a sizable percentage of their operating cash flow back into their respective businesses. In other words, they're willing to forgo maximum profits in the short term to invest in higher-growth initiatives that could really fuel their growth rates years down the road.\n\nRather than relying on the forward P/E ratio, analyzing the multiple that each company trades at relative to its forward-year consensus cash flow is a considerably smarter way to value these dominant businesses.\n\nHere's how the Magnificent Seven stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive when examined relative to next year's cash flow:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 12.53 times next year's cash consensus cash flow Amazon: 12.8 Meta Platforms: 13.19 Apple: 21.1 Microsoft: 24.15 Tesla: 27.38 Nvidia: 30.59\n\nOn one hand, Microsoft, Tesla, and especially Nvidia are making it tougher for growth seekers to find value. Tesla's operating margin is falling as it slashes prices on its production models in order to keep inventory levels under control. Meanwhile, Nvidia is set to face a laundry list of headwinds -- including AI GPU competition from many of its top customers (which are Magnificent Seven components).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Amazon is historically inexpensive, relative to its future cash flow. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of net sales, Amazon could see its cash-flow growth handily outpace its annual sales growth. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms confirms that it's still a potential bargain at just 13 times forward-year cash flow.\n\nBut the best deal within the Magnificent Seven is Alphabet, which also happens to be the cheapest constituent when using the forward P/E ratio.\n\nAlphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be Google. With a nearly 92% share of worldwide internet search, Google is the logical go-to for advertisers looking to target their message(s) to specific consumers. More often than not, this will give Google exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet's advertising segments benefiting from long-winded economic expansions, Google Cloud looks like a force to be reckoned with. After years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered its first operating profit in 2023.\n\nCloud service margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and enterprise cloud spending is likely in its early innings. In short, this segment may be Alphabet's prime source of cash-flow growth throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal among the Magnificent Seven stocks, the data suggests you can't go wrong with Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Believe It or Not, Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still Isn’t Expensive",
        "content": "Chipmaker and AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its unstoppable upward journey, having more than tripled in value in 2023 and up about 78% year-to-date. The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\n\nNVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again\n\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share handily beat the analysts’ estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\n\nImportantly, NVDA’s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\n\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\n\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, “We’re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing… [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive\n\nNVDA is Wall Street’s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia’s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What’s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA’s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\n\nNVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock Split\n\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn’t inherently alter the company’s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\n\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple’s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\n\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\n\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA’s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.\n\nThe insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.\n\nWith NVDA’s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.\n\nDisclosure",

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.35%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.3%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 7.07% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.61% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.42%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has acquired Canadian artificial intelligence startup DarwinAI, adding technology to its arsenal ahead of a big push into generative AI in 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSpaceX Starship Nears Orbit, But Is Lost Before Return to Earth Millennium Trader Scored $40 Million Windfall in Egypt FX Plunge Biden’s Best Shot Against Trump Lies in ‘Blue Wall’ States Putin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia Bond Yields Jump as Hot Inflation Curbs Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap\n\nThe iPhone maker purchased the business earlier this year, and dozens of DarwinAI’s employees have joined Apple’s artificial intelligence division, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn’t been announced.\n\nDarwinAI has developed AI technology for visually inspecting components during the manufacturing process and serves customers in a range of industries. But one of its core technologies is making artificial intelligence systems smaller and faster. That work that could be helpful to Apple, which is focused on running AI on devices rather than entirely in the cloud.\n\nAlexander Wong, an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who helped build the business, has joined Apple as a director in its AI group as part of the deal.\n\nIn response to questions about the deal, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” but doesn’t discuss its plans.\n\nApple shares briefly gained on the news, rising more than 1% to $173.37. It was trading at $172.92 as of 1:29 p.m. in New York, down about 10% for the year.\n\nWaterloo, Ontario-based DarwinAI had raised more than $15 million as of 2022, according to the Canadian startup community Communitech. It received investments from Honeywell Ventures and Inovia Capital, among other venture capital firms. The startup also has worked with companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Intel Corp., according to Communitech.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe under-the-radar acquisition comes ahead of a big AI push for Apple this year. The company is adding features to its iOS 18 software that rely on generative AI, the technology behind ChatGPT and other groundbreaking tools. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple will “break new ground” in AI this year, and an announcement is expected as soon as the company’s worldwide developers conference in June.\n\nDespite having acquired more AI companies than most rivals over the past decade, Apple has fallen behind in the generative AI market. It was caught flat-footed by the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022, and tech peers like Google and Microsoft Corp. have stolen the spotlight with new features.\n\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot\n\nInternally, Apple has started integrating generative AI into its operations, using the technology to assist with customer service requests. It’s also planning to add features to its software for auto-creating presentations and completing blocks of texts. And Apple is working on a new version of its Xcode programming software that uses AI to help developers write code.\n\n(Updates with Apple shares in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy for the Next Big Tech Boom",
        "content": "Investors may not want to write metaverse stocks off just yet.\n\nAccording to Market.us, the market could be worth about $2.3 trillion by 2032. All thanks to advancements in virtual reality, augmented reality, and the potential for millions to immerse themselves in virtual environments. Helping, there are about a billion active users in the metaverse at the moment, which could double by 2025.\n\nPlus, consider this. “Gaming remains the dominant sector in the Metaverse, accounting for over 60% of total market revenue. The average Metaverse user spends over 15 hours per week in virtual environments, with spending on virtual goods and services exceeding $1,000 per year,” says Market.us. Even “the healthcare sector is utilizing the Metaverse for telemedicine, virtual therapy sessions and medical training simulations, improving access to healthcare services and training.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd that’s just the start. With growing interest, investors may want to pay close attention to top metaverse stocks, such as:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to own is Roblox (NYSE:RBLX).\n\nOver the last few months, it ran from about $26 to about $46, where it failed at double-top. Now consolidating around $40, I’d like to see it challenge prior resistance again.\n\nMost recently, the company posted a fourth-quarter loss of 52 cents, which was narrower than the expected 55 cents. Revenues of $750 million were up 30% year over year. Bookings — which measure sales of virtual currency — jumped 25% year over year to $1.13 billion.\n\nMoving forward, RBLX expects for bookings to come in between $910 million and $940 million, which is also better than forecasts for $902.7 million. And for the full year, it sees bookings in the range of $4.14 billion and $4.28 billion, which is above estimates for $4.098 billion.\n\nBetter, Benchmark analysts, who have a buy rating on RBLX, say, “The company has set ambitious financial targets, aiming for over 20% annual growth in its top line through at least 2027, alongside targeting an annual margin expansion of 100 to 300 basis points by managing the growth of its fixed costs,” as quoted by Barron’s.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is another interesting metaverse stock to buy. Since late 2022, the stock has been stuck in a channel between $26 and $45. Now, for the eighth time, the stock appears ready to bounce from the lower range of the channel, with another potential test of $45 ahead. Until it breaks below $26 or above $45, it’s likely to stay within that range for a bit.\n\nMost recently, the stock did pull back on earnings and guidance.\n\nWhile revenues of $609 million were far better than expectations for $560.45 million, an EPS loss of 66 cents was below estimates for a loss of 45 cents.\n\nMoving forward, “Unity expects first-quarter revenue to be between $415M and $420M, well below the consensus of $536M. Full-year sales are forecast to be between $1.76B and $1.8B, which is below the consensus of $2.32B,” says Seeking Alpha.\n\nFortunately, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin just upgraded the Unity stock to a neutral rating. He noted, “The strategic portfolio overhaul is a welcome sign and yields a few reasons to be a bit more optimistic on an improved margin profile with a leaner model shifting away from hardware and a potential rule of 40 model when the dust settles at the end of 2024.”\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify your metaverse holdings at a low cost, there’s the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF is the world’s largest metaverse fund holds Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to name a few.\n\nAccording to Roundhill Investments, the ETF could benefit from two key areas of growth.\n\nOne “The Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion.” Two, “VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.” Both could help fuel a significant upside for the METV ETF.\n\nPlus, consider this. According to the METV investor deck, a McKinsey report states the impact potential for the metaverse, by 2030, could reach $4 trillion to $5 trillion. In addition, Morgan Stanley estimates that the metaverse — just in the U.S. and in China —could be a $16.3 trillion opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "13 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued EV stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the global electric vehicle industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\n\nWhile some high growth sectors such as high performance computing, cloud networks, and data centers have seen robust performance in 2024 particularly when artificial intelligence is thrown into the mix, others like clean energy have struggled in the changed global monetary environment.\n\nThe aftermath of the pandemic era government spending and the Russian invasion of Ukraine's effects on monetary policy has made it difficult for firms to find capital to fund their expensive manufacturing plants and for consumers to squeeze in pricey electric vehicle purchases in their budgets.\n\nCoupled with instability in the raw material markets, particularly the one for lithium that has nearly stripped all incentives from mining companies to produce the battery metal, electric vehicle stocks are having a bumpy road on the market. As an example, consider three pure play EV stocks, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO). Their share price performance year to date is affected by factors related to the U.S. electric vehicle market, the firms' business environment, and those present in China. The lackluster Chinese economic conditions are also responsible for the slowdown in lithium prices as a slowdown in EV demand in the country has meant that producers whose output is designed to match heavy demand sit with excess lithium on their hands, in a situation that's also called a glut.\n\nFor instance, the worst performing EV stock among these three is the Chinese firm NIO, whose shares are down by 30% year to date. This drop has been fueled by weakening analyst sentiment, with notable downgrades from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Both have downgraded NIO's shares, and BofA led the bank in January when it slashed NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)'s shares to Neutral from Buy. Like JPMorgan's later downgrade to Underperform from Neutral, Bank of America analysts shared that a lack of new models will hinder the firm's ability to effectively compete in the cut throat Chinese electric vehicle industry. They also added that since NIO has yet to introduce new models, it might have to increase its marketing spending in the coming months and years. While spending on marketing is good, the BofA analysts believe that if NIO is also forced to cut its prices, then the lower revenue could constrain its margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting focus on Tesla, its shares fell in 2022 and then recovered some of the losses last year. In 2024, the firm's shares tanked by 12% after its revenue of $25.17 billion and EPS of 71 cents ended up missing analyst estimates. This led short sellers to make billions of dollars according to some estimates, and the outlook was gloomy as the world's biggest pure play electric vehicle company warned that sales growth in 2024 could be slower.\n\nTesla was not the only electric vehicle stock that left investors thirsting for more in the wake of its fourth quarter earnings. Another such stock was Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). The stock is down a whopping 47% year to date, after management shared during earnings that \"challenging macro-economic conditions\" would lead it to make 51,000 vehicles this year - a hefty drop from what analysts were expecting. However, Rivian investors were nevertheless comforted by the fact that the demand for its vehicles is solid, as evidenced by a revenue beat.\n\nLooking at how these trends have affected EV stocks as a whole, the performance of the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index provides us with a benchmark. Unsurprisingly, the index is down by 13% over the past twelve months. Over the past three years, the index is down by 23%, highlighting that while stocks such as Tesla have nevertheless posted some returns during the period, the broader EV sector has struggled in the era of high rates and high inflation. Narrowing down our EV stock index performance band to six, three, and one month, quarter to date, the index is down 6.9%, while over the month it is flat. The six month performance is -6%.\n\nSo, the next question to ask is, amidst this bloodbath, what is smart money thinking? Well, these concerns were also present on Baron Funds' mind, with its latest investor letter mentioning Tesla and outlining:\n\nTesla’s stock declined slightly in the period because the core automotive segment remained under pressure. A complex macroeconomic environment, higher interest rates, a two-week factory shutdown, and Tesla’s car price reductions throughout the year pressured its near-term growth and margin profile. Nonetheless, Tesla continues to generate sufficient gross profit to support robust product development. Tesla also started to deliver its highly anticipated Cybertruck, its first pickup truck. There has been tremendous consumer interest in the truck and new technologies within the vehicle and its manufacturing lines. Tesla’s refreshed Model 3 also seems to be generating strong demand while improving unit-level economics. We anticipate a new lower priced vehicle being introduced next year to address a much larger market segment. Finally, investors expect Tesla to benefit from its investment in AI through development of autonomous driving technology Dojo (an AI training computer), Autobidder (an automated energy trading platform), and Humanoid (a human-like robot)\n\nFinally, before we look at the most undervalued EV stocks according to analysts, 2024 appears to be the end of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s foray into the electric vehicle industry. Multiple reports in the press suggest that its 'Apple Car' project has been shelved, which is unsurprising considering the significant manufacturing investments needed to successfully mass produce a car.\n\nSo, which EV stocks are the most undervalued according to analysts? We took a look and a couple of notable names are Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR), Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), and Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp. (NASDAQ:SOLO). 13 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA lithium battery recharging a fleet of electric vehicles in a parking lot.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most undervalued EV stocks according to analysts, we ranked all that either make electric vehicles or serve manufacturers' needs by their average analyst share price percentage upside. The EV stocks with the highest upside were selected, and the price data was collected from Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor these most undervalued EV stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\n13. VinFast Auto Ltd.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Apple (AAPL): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AAPL Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.\n\nAnother change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.  reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:\n\nSince the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). 13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside. Out of these, the stocks with the highest upside were selected. Data for the price targets was sourced from Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor these undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best Guru stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.\n\nAccording to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.\n\nIn this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered out the 12 best stocks out of The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU)’s portfolio of 61 holdings as of March 11 based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n7. Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

During the same month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk cautioned that growth would be \"notably lower\" this year.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London and European markets flat as no bonus for John Lewis staff\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the average Wall Street rating for Tesla is \"hold,\" as many analysts believe that the demand decline could stabilise later in the year.\n\n\"We can concur the price wars in China are brutal however there is a sense from industry checks that many of these price cuts are starting to subside into spring/summer 2024,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Reuters.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nIt might be one of the Magnificent Seven but Apple has had a rough start to 2024 with shares down by around 7% amid weaker iPhone sales and App Store lawsuits all while being behind the curve on AI.\n\nHowever, it might not be all doom and gloom for the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm.\n\n“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nAccording to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nThe boss of Shell was paid nearly £8m last year as the oil major has watered down one of its climate pledges.\n\nWael Sawan was handed a total pay packet worth £7.94m during the period, Shell said, a reduction from the £9.7m that his predecessor Ben van Beurden earned in 2022, although higher than van Beurden’s pay package for 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nSawan’s package included a base salary of £1.4m, an annual bonus of £2.7m and a £2.6m long-term incentive payment.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price hits all-time high of over $73,000\n\nShell said that it now plans to reduce the “net carbon intensity” of the energy it sells by 15-20% by 2030 compared to 2016.

        "content": "There’s something special about spring; days are getting longer, flowers are in bloom and the evenings are turning from frigid to delightful. In fact, one of the few things I can appreciate even more than the spring weather are some reliable dividend stocks.\n\nJust as flowers emerge from the ground every year, income investors can count on the best dividend stocks to provide a reliable return.\n\nThey give retirees an income stream, and they provide younger investors with an opportunity to reinvest the payout, turbocharging their portfolios and building toward the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe very best dividend stocks can also be counted on to provide solid returns as a stock. That’s what we’re looking for.\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to find highly rated stocks based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors. To top it off, we’re only looking for stocks that also have a good score on the companion Dividend Grader tool.\n\nInvesting in these seven stocks is a surefire way to earn solid returns and a reliable dividend.\n\nYou can look forward to it with anticipation, just as much as you look forward to the first warm spring day of the year.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is simply the biggest company in the world by market capitalization. Valued now at more than $3 trillion, Microsoft makes a fortune from developing, licensing, and supporting software and services.\n\nIts involvement in generative artificial intelligence, the latest fad on Wall Street that is changing how many businesses operate fueled its most recent surge over the last year.\n\nGenerative AI can create high-quality text, content and images that appear if a human created them. Microsoft invested $13 billion into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and infused many of its products with generative AI.\n\nMicrosoft’s revenue was $62 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up 18% from a year ago. While Microsoft’s 0.7% dividend yield is nothing to write about, the company increased the size of the dividend annually for the last 22 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMSFT stock is up 63% in the last 12 months. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and a “B” rating in the Dividend Grader.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used to be the No. 1 company in the world before Microsoft passed it.\n\nWith a capitalization of $2.6 trillion, Apple hasn’t been able to keep up with Microsoft, recording a gain in the last 12 months of only 14%.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with a 14% gain. Apple is soundly outperforming the market. But I also understand why some investors have been a little disappointed in Apple in recent months.\n\nThe company faces headwinds from China from a significant challenger in Huawei, which is finally rolling out its own 5G smartphone as a direct competitor. Apple saw its sales drop in China by 24% in the last quarter, as Huais solidly in second place.\n\nThat helped revenue drop by 2.8% from a year ago and increased sales by only 2% overall.\n\nCEO Tim Cook promises Apple will “break new ground” this year with generative AI, and the company also ended is work developing electric vehicles to devote more resources into AI.\n\nThat’s the right call, because Apple needs to return to its innovative roots if it’s going to hit the $3 trillion mark in market cap.\n\nI still have plenty of faith in Apple, which provides a dividend yield of nearly 0.5% and raised its dividend in each of the last 12 years. AAPL gets “B” ratings in both the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

JPMorgan is the biggest bank in the United States, with more than 4,800 locations and total assets under management of $3.3 trillion.\n\nJPMorgan provides banking, investment, and financial services, including deposit accounts, lending, advisory services, and asset management.\n\nThe company saw net revenue of $38.57 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year ago. However, net income was down 15%, as JPMorgan is integrating the former First Republic Bank and remodeling its existing branches.\n\nNonetheless, JPM stock is up a strong 40% in the last year, and should continue to improve as interest rates fall in 2024, as expected, and the homebuying market gathers strength.\n\nJPMorgan provides a dividend yield of 2.2%. It gets “B” ratings in the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer in the world, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe company saw strong growth in 2023, with revenue in the fourth quarter coming in at $173.4 billion, up 5.7% from a year ago.

About 1 in 3 people who have taken the drug at its highest dose (15 mg) report losing more than 58 pounds over a 72-week period.\n\nNot surprisingly, LLY stock performed well over the last year, rising by 140% as investors piled in.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported its second straight quarter of strong profit growth after lucrative AI hardware sales helped offset weakness in iPhone and electronics demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia US House Passes Bill That Would Force TikTok Sale or Ban It Tesla Gets Tagged With Once-Unthinkable Call: Sales Will Fall Ex-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary Ukraine Hits Third Russian Refinery in Escalating Drone Strikes\n\nThe world’s largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones posted a 33% rise in net income to NT$53.2 billion ($1.7 billion) in the quarter ended December. That beat an average of analyst estimates of NT$43.8 billion, helped by a large one-time gain.\n\nThe company’s shares are up more than 15% this year, buoyed by growing optimism about Foxconn’s opportunity to benefit from demand for artificial intelligence servers and hardware. The Taiwanese assembler, known also as Foxconn, wasn’t among the initial cohort of companies boosted by the AI frenzy, but investors and analysts see it likely to gain a growing share of such business. This month, it was reported to have secured a major order from longtime US partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.\n\nFor the current period, Hon Hai had forecast that sales would decline again, as it’s coming off an elevated comparison base from the post-pandemic recovery period early last year. AI sales have helped it improve profit while weathering a down year for the iPhone, the flagship product that first brought Foxconn global renown.\n\n“The business saw a good sequential rebound into Q4 partly driven by the AI-focused side, but if you take a step back and look at 2023 as a whole, it was a relatively weak year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea said. “The company should have a much better year as their main customers start to rebuild inventory.”\n\nJPMorgan earlier this week said that Foxconn’s rally could extend as the market is betting increasingly on the company’s prospects in AI server infrastructure from the second half of the year. Analysts including Gokul Hariharan estimate that Hon Hai’s AI revenue and gross profit exposure is likely to be in the 10-12% range in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, with Apple making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. This month, Counterpoint Research said iPhone sales in China fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.\n\n(Updates with analyst reaction)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

        "content": "(Recasts with outlook for 2024)\n\nBy Yimou Lee and Faith Hung\n\nTAIPEI, March 14 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn said on Thursday it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2024 following a slow start to the year amid booming demand for AI servers, after it posted fourth-quarter profit that beat market estimates.\n\nThe outlook has turned rosier since Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said in November the world's largest contract electronics maker had \"relatively conservative and neutral\" expectations for 2024.\n\nThe Taiwanese company said October-December net profit jumped 33% to T$53.14 billion ($1.69 billion) from T$40 billion in the same period the previous year thanks to robust demand for AI servers and strong sales during the peak year-end holiday season.\n\nThe profit beat a T$43.52 billion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 58% of revenue while cloud and networking products, including servers, contributed 20%.\n\nFoxconn said it expects revenue for the first quarter to slightly decline from a year earlier, with revenue for smart computer electronics also likely to drop in the period.\n\nThe company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has said it expects slowness in this year's first quarter to be similar to the same period of the previous three years.\n\nStill, it sees 2024 revenue increasingly significantly year-on-year, it said.\n\nThe first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.\n\nApple last month reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business though its China sales missed analysts' targets.\n\nFoxconn's shares closed up 0.4% on Thursday ahead of the earnings release, compared with a flat broader market.

        "title": "It’s not all doom and gloom for Apple in 2024",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThose headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.\n\nAnd, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.\n\nGenerative AI could be a boon\n\nWall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.\n\n“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nPlus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added. Apple's iPhone sales are stumbling in China. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.\n\nServices are still a winner\n\nApple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”\n\nBofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”\n\nApple gets people to pay more\n\nBut one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.\n\nThat, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.\n\n“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.\n\nAll of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 oversold NASDAQ stocks to buy right now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nNASDAQ Leads The Market\n\nOn March 12, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up by 1.5%, spearheaded by the technology stocks that have been leading the tech-heavy index ever higher for a long time now. While being heavily focused on the tech sector, the NASDAQ is also known for its exposure to other sectors, such as the consumer discretionary, healthcare, and financial sectors, all of which contribute to the index's success. As a result of these market leaders, the NASDAQ has steadily become an attractive marketplace for budding and seasoned investors alike.\n\nMany investors today are thinking about current market dynamics in terms of the future outlook for the upcoming months and what that may mean for investors. On March 12, Gabriela Santos, chief market strategist at JPMorgan, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss her thoughts on the current outlook and market. Here's what she had to say:\n\n\"We do sound positive, first on the fundamentals. For the economy, we see growth normalizing this year 2%, but zero recession in our base case. We see inflation also moderating towards 2% by the end of the year, so you still have a pretty resilient nominal growth backdrop for companies, so resilient revenue growth. At the same time, it seem to us that the big takeaway from fourth-quarter earnings was a bottoming in the margin contraction from last year.\"\n\nThe highlights above show that a positive trend for stocks should continue as we move forward into 2024, which should be encouraging for investors looking to buy into the market. Considering the upside gains in the NASDAQ being seen so far, this index may be a good place to start for those looking to buy. This is especially the case considering the fact that the index compromises of some of the most influential and profitable names in the market right now, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversifying Outside of Tech in 2024\n\nFor investors, one thing to note at present is that big tech isn't the only area to keep an eye on when it comes to the Nasdaq Composite Index. Santos, on CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" highlights the fact that several other names within the tech sector and outside of it are now also beginning to rake in the gains. Here's what she said:\n\n\"It's actually a healthy sign. For example, within mega-cap tech, the 'Magnificent Seven' that dominated so much of returns last year, there was dispersion within the group but they were all up. This year, you're seeing quite substantial dispersion within the group. Some are up double digits, some are performing in line with the market, and some are down double digits. That's very healthy to see, thinking of the actual companies as individuals. You're also seeing other parts of the tech sector participate, and other sectors. Things like healthcare, which we had talked a lot about last year as being one of our favorite sectors, contributing as well. So I think it's a very healthy appreciation, that it's not just AI, it's not just about the initial beneficiaries of that theme, it's also about resilient earnings.\"\n\nIn light of the above, we believe that while tech is definitely an area to keep track of this year, investors should not just put all their eggs in the tech basket. As such, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ to buy right now. Our list compromises both oversold stocks in the tech sector and in other sectors, such as healthcare, to give a more holistic set of options to investors looking to buy right now. You'll thus find that we have quite a few options below to choose from, ranging from cheap healthcare stocks to buy to oversold tech stocks to buy. 11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA trader in a financial institution using fundamentals analysis to select stocks for a portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to pick oversold stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index for our list. The RSI indicator is a momentum indicator used in the technical analysis of stocks by measuring the speed and magnitude of a security’s recent price changes to evaluate whether the price of that security is overvalued or undervalued. Stocks with RSI values of over 70 are traditionally considered overbought, while those with RSI values under 30 are oversold. We thus used a stock screener to find oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ with RSI values under 30 and then ranked them based on this metric, from the highest to the lowest RSI value. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nOversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n11. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

How did this go from a growth stock to a value stock? There have been two causes, in my opinion. The first is that their product delivering content (not apps) on phones lost T-Mobile as a customer – sometimes we are one day closer to a bad outcome: the loss of a customer. The second, and bigger issue was with their SingleTap product. SingleTap is a technology that “enables smartphone users to instantly install an app to their Android device with a single tap…bypassing the noise of the app store environment, and dramatically increasing conversions.” The higher conversion rates mean lower costs per app install or app opening…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

        "content": "(Adds details from filing, attempt to reach Apple for comment)\n\nMarch 13 (Reuters) - Epic Games, which makes the popular video game \"Fortnite,\" on Wednesday urged a federal judge to hold Apple in contempt for allegedly violating an injunction governing how its lucrative App Store operates, and demanded compliance.\n\nThe companies have been battling in court since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through its App Store, where it charges up to 30% commissions on in-app purchases.\n\nA September 2021 injunction required Apple to let app developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content.\n\nIn a filing with the Oakland, California, federal court, Epic alleged Apple was in \"blatant violation\" of that injunction following changes made in January.\n\nIt said Apple has imposed a new fee and rules that make the links \"commercially unusable,\" continues to \"categorically prohibit\" buttons, and still prohibits some apps from steering consumers to other purchasing means.\n\n\"Apple's goal is clear: to prevent purchasing alternatives from constraining the supracompetitive fees it collects on purchases of digital goods and services,\" Epic said. \"Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The upcoming games are expected to help Apple attract new users for the Vision Pro.\r\n\r\nApple has been suffering from stiff competition in the smartphone space, as well as weak demand in China that has hurt the iPhone’s top-line growth. The company is still very much dependent on the iPhone for generating top-line growth.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock",
        "content": "Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:  Top 5 Energy Stocks You May Want To Dump In March\n\nPhoto: ABCDstock/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Our total revenues reached RMB13 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 31.4%, significantly outpacing the growth rate of the secondhand industry and consumer sector as a whole. I would like to express my gratitude to our colleagues on the frontline and in all departments for their hard work.\r\n Our total transaction volume in 2023 was 32.3 million units. We adhere to the strategy of prioritizing self-operated business that provides better services and user experience. This focus has yielded significant results, with our [Wati] transaction volume increasing by 50% year over year in 2023.\r\n Regarding third-party platform businesses, we actively adjusted our development strategy and made efforts to develop merchant ecosystem and service capabilities. The overall platform take rate increased by 92 basis points to 5.39% in 2023. The number of registered merchants on PJT Marketplace reached 596,000, a strong growth of 46.2% compared to the previous year, which lays solid foundations for future development.\r\n 2023 was also a year of consolidation and efficiency. We further solidified our secondhand supply chain capabilities, providing more valuable services on our platforms. At the same time, we were also more disciplined at the pace of our expansion and investments in new initiatives. At the profit level, we achieved a solid non-GAAP operating profit of RMB252 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit margin of 1.9%, exceeding our target for the year.\r\n Those achievements are firmly grounded in our strategic focus. Firstly, we appear to effective customer customer acquisition scenarios on the recycling front; secondly, strengthening robust supply chain capabilities as a foundation; thirdly, driving efficiency improvements through technology; and fourthly, being agile in seizing new traffic opportunities and capturing new customer demand.\r\n Now, I will walk you through these four strategic perspectives. First, on the recycling front, we continue to successfully execute our customer acquisition strategy by leveraging our precise recycling scenarios. By the end of 2023, we have presence in 268 cities in China, reaching consumers through 1,819 AHS stores offline. We have constantly enhanced our service accessibility in high-quality business districts and communities.\r\n We further penetrated the market by combining offline stores with online platforms. Over the past year, consumer awareness and trust in our AHS Recycle brand have steadily improved, especially in big cities where recycling rates are improving. By leveraging our physical stores, freemium service reputation, and retail partners, we precisely target [using] mainstream recycling scenarios. With competitive prices and higher efficiency, we obtain high-quality sources of free on goods, fortifying the group's supply chain capability in the main business lines.\r\n In June 2023, we were pleased to announce the official collaboration with Apple for its recycling and trading services in Mainland China. Our partnership is designed to meet user demand for convenient recycling and low-cost upgrade to brand-new item products. This service is now available at the brand's official website and online flagship stores. Notably, during the fourth quarter, despite flat iPhone sales, this collaboration contributed RMB300 million to our revenues.\r\n Additionally, in terms of e-commerce partners, we have solidified our collaboration with JD's mobile and electronics retail departments, offering one-stop, single-device and multi-device trade-in services. This caters to JD's wide user base who seek more cost-effective shopping options and better recycling experiences when operating their gadgets. Overall, the growth recycling value of trade-in business on JD channels doubled in 2023.\r\n By expanding our multi-category recycling efforts, we have further strengthened appeal of our second scenario for users. The updated slogan Apple show, recycling more for you, reflects our commitment to expanding into additional categories beyond our core focus on consumer electronics. We are dedicated to fulfilling the growing demand for recycling and cash for high value -- cashback for high-value categories such as luxury goods, gold, and vintage wines. Looking ahead, we aim to expand to lower value item recycling while promoting the recycle and reuse of more idle goods.\r\n Building market cap with recycling capabilities primarily involves upgrades of family wealth, upgrading story experiences and IT systems, while fully establishing fulfillment capabilities with professional service providers. Our fulfillment strategies vary with the residual value of goods, with in-store drop-off and doorstep pickup options, users could circulate more used products with ease.\r\n By the end of 2023, we have introduced model at recycling services into 262 AHS stores. During the year, the GMV for nine electronic products at the recycling front exceeded RMB1 billion. At the same time, we bring AHS Recycle brand closer to communities and users' daily lives. Our extended presence in communities and commercial areas, coupled with an increasing density of multi-category recycling stores, encourages customers to reuse our services more often.\r\n Moving on to our supply chain processing capabilities, our highly efficient supply chain management ensures recycled goods are inspected at a lower cost while achieving accurate grading and pricing results. This allows a consistent and stable supply of goods. We have also improved our operation center's shipping and receiving capacity and enhanced their space utilization efficiency.\r\n Furthermore, our main operation centers are equipped with compliant refurbishment capabilities. The annual revenue from our self-operated compliant refurbishment business reached RMB810 million, accounting for 9.4% of the core one fewer second business segment revenue.\r\n Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the refurbishment business increased by 41.5% compared with the previous year, while the gross profit margin was 1.6 percentage point higher. This is mainly attributable to our intelligent supply chain system, which enables more accurate identification of devices suitable for refurbishment, resulting in a higher number of devices in various conditions being selected for the project.\r\n We actively participated in [taking] advantages to drive industry prosperity. In 2023, as a major drafting party, ATRenew played a key role in establishing the Electronic Product Refurbishment Industry Committee initiated by the Shenzhen Electronics Industry Association. We contributed to various group standards, including general requirement for refurbishment, labeling and information disclosure, quality management, and technical specifications. These standards serve as industry references for intellectual property protection, product data security quality, as well as user rights protection.\r\n On distribution, our advantages of an integrated B2C plus B2B platform will further magnified. In 2023, GMV of the core self-operated retail business totaled RMB2.88 billion, leveraging our supply chain strengths. Paipai has trends in its [1P2] consumer retail capabilities, meeting consumer demand for high-quality pre-owned products. To highlight, 1P2 consumer compliant refurbished product sales contributed RMB560 million in revenue.\r\n In 2023, we introduced a new consignment model to address the challenges faced by secondhand industry merchants, difficulties in operating to consumer e-commerce stores, and the struggles of small businesses. Through PJT Marketplace, we effectively connect Paipai stores with small- and medium-sized merchants, thus removing barriers that previously hindered small merchants from integrating their supply into our platform.\r\n Merchants now only need to lease their products and confirm pricing, while the platform takes care of the store operations, sales, customer services, and after-sales support. This initiative significantly lowered the entry barrier for B2C merchants, enriches the platform supply forces, and ensures a seamless purchasing experience for users. GMV for the consignment business summed up RMB70 million in 2023.\r\n In the fourth quarter of 2023, the overall business of PJT Marketplace rebounded, primarily due to a recovery in trading activities and the 35.3% year-over-year increase in the number of active merchant users. Additionally, we took the strategic decision to restructure the low commission rate spare stock business, and this reduced our costs and optimized the overall take rate of B2B platform.\r\n As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, service revenues from PJT Marketplace increased by 14.9% year on year, and the overall take rate rose by 69 basis points to 6.02%. On an annual basis, its overall take rate reached 6.17%, a significant improvement of 189 basis points compared to the 2022 level. We are proud of the proven business model of PJT Marketplace, as it's an indispensable infrastructure of the industry.\r\n Looking ahead, we will further open up our supply chain advantages and become a high-quality supplier for pre-owned products in the industry. At the same time, we will provide models suitable for B2C retail and steady supply through online e-commerce platform, live streaming channels, as well as offline mobile phone retail networks and service stations. In an environment where consumers are more cautious with their expenses, ATRenew aims to leverage its competitive pricing and quality assurance of pre-owned products to foster mutual success with our partners.\r\n Firstly, in terms of technology and efficiency, we continue to promote the application of automation technology. Firstly, we have enhanced the accuracy of quality inspection. The automated quality inspection system, represented by Matrix 3.0, has reduced losses caused by quality inspection errors by 19% throughout the year.\r\n Secondly, with our focus on 1P business, we improved capacity utilization in our automated operation centers in South and East China. Thirdly, through optimizing supply chain management for receiving and delivering goods in different locations, we reduced logistics costs. As a result of these initiatives, our non-GAAP fulfillment expense as a percentage of total revenue has continued its downward trend, reaching 8.5% for the full year 2023, significantly down from 10.9% in 2022. And this underscores our dedication to achieving further cost reduction at scale.\r\n In the overseas market, we are delighted to see strong interest in our automated technology for pre-owned consumer electronics. Beyond the Mainland China market, our quality inspection technology has been successfully deployed in Hong Kong and Japan.\r\n In November 2023 -- in October 2023, we expanded our global footprint by collaborating with our European partner to bring our one-stop recycling kiosk solution to Sweden. Our one-stop solution effectively addresses the international demand for C2B recycling services. Moving forward, we remain committed to our growth trajectory and will continue to support global circulation of pre-owned products.\r\n Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year of 2024, we believe that ATRenew operates in a sustained circular economy that is impervious to economic fluctuations and technological changes. We identified several key trends in the sector. On the recycling front, we see a definite demand for convenient, high-priced, and trustworthy recycling services. On the purchasing end, we see a stronger demand for value-for-money goods from service consumers. On the fulfillment end, we see an unchanging need from secondhand merchants for efficient and hassle-free trading and logistics solutions. In late February this year, President Yi emphasized the promotion of a new round (technical difficulty)\r\n As a leading company in this field, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on this upward trend and better facilitate JD and brand owners training programs. Once again, it demonstrates that recycling and trading are encouraged by national policies as a long-term stable industry with high certainty and low policy risks. Going forward, we will adhere to our long-term core strategy and fortify our business foundations.\r\n While enhancing brand awareness for AHS Recycle, we aim to address users' fundamental pain points and collaborate with industry partners to explore the untapped potential of high-quality secondhand products. We will maintain patience in the long run while steadily releasing profits and achieving growth.\r\n Finally, I am delighted to announce an international accolade. In November 2023, ATRenew was honored as highly commended by the judging panel at the Reuters Global Business Responsibility Award in the circular transition category. This marks a milestone for ATRenew as it is the first time we have stood shoulder to shoulder with global multinational companies such as Oracle, Schneider Electric, and Pepsico. The recognition from Reuters and the expert panel is a testament to our innovation and our technological achievements. Moving forward, we will continue to deepen our commitment to the circular economy, driving sustainable industry development through technological innovation.\r\n Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Rex, for financial updates.\n\nRex Chen\n\nOkay. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2023 was a year of significant achievements for our company. Both revenue and operating income saw better-than-expected results. Total net revenue increased by 31.4% to RMB13 billion, and adjusted operating income of 2023 totaled RMB251.7 million, a remarkable 36.5 times the number of 2022. Cash inflow from operating activities was healthy, totaling RMB236 million for the carousel. 2023 was our year of consolidation and efficiency.\r\n Moving on to the fourth quarter 2023, we are pleased to announce another profitable quarter, and we recorded another new record non-GAAP operating income on revenues that was, again, exceeded the top end of our guidance.\r\n Now, let's take a detailed look at our financials. Please note that all amounts are in RMB, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. In the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased by 29.9% to 3,873.6 million, driven by strong growth in net product revenues and a rebounding service revenues. Net product revenues increased by 31.1% to 3,502.5 million, while net service revenues was 351.1 million, representing an increase of 19.7%.\r\n Closing net product revenues was primarily driven by an increased U.S. sales of preowned consumer electronics through both PJT. and paper marketplaces as well as offline channels, of which sales of LinkedIn purposed devices totaled 278.2 million, which increased by 41.5% sequentially. Increasing service revenues was primarily due to the recovery of paper and the PJT. market process with the efficient online and offline customer acquisition and better execution of our take rate of our marketplaces went up 56 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.6% in the fourth quarter 2023.\r\n Now, let's discuss our operating expenses to provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operating expenses. We will also discuss our non-GAAP operating expenses, which better reflect how management views our results of operations. So reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and the corresponding Form six K furnished with the SEC.\r\n Merchandise costs increased by 32.9% to stand at 115 million. So increase was in line with the growth in product sales. Gross margin at the Group level was 18.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for our 1P business was 10.6% in the fourth quarter.\r\n Hey, Justin, you saw soft April 15th services. We implemented a proactive approach to attract customers with aggressive pricing strategies causing gross margin compression. We believe that as our market share within these channels gross So gross profit away, it will gradually return to normal levels. Fulfillment expenses increased by 9.5% to 301.1 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses, we will which we will refer to as SBC from PR. Non-gaap fulfillment expenses increased by 14% to 295.6 million, and the non-GAAP measures to increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and logistical costs as we conducted the motorcycle and the transaction certain activities year-on-year.\r\n Non-gaap fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 7.6% from 8.7%. So overall, decreasing retail fulfillment expenses reflects the impact of the economies of scale and efficiency improvements through automated operations, specifically has a number of onetime orders grow. So average fulfillment cost of product was reduced. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 46.6% to 317 million, while excluding SBC expenses and amortization and the impairment loss of goodwill and the intangible assets.\r\n Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses increased by 11 points, 11.0% to 246.6 million, primarily due to an increase in the expenses related to marketing activities. Non-gaap selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 6.4% from 7.5%. General and administrative expenses decreased by 18.8% to 62.2 million. Excluding SBC expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses decreased by 17.4% to 45.2 million primarily due to a decrease in headquarter profit, office expenses and fees related to professional services.\r\n Non-GAAP G&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.2% from 1.8%. Technology and content expenses increased by 17.1% to 63.8 million, excluding SBC expenses and amortization and impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets, Non-GAAP technology and content expenses increased by 52.6% to 58.3 million. So the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs in connection with the upgrades of the complex operating center and the systems. Non-gaap technology and content expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.5% from 1.3%. As a result, our non-GAAP operating income was 81.6 million in the fourth quarter of 23, representing a significant increase of 135.8% year-on-year. Non-gaap operating profit margin was 2.1% compared to 1.2% in 4Q 2022.\r\n To provide some context regarding our balance sheet our inventories amounted to 1 billion as at the end of the fourth quarter of 20 industry, representing a sequential increase of EUR344.8 million compared to we see end of the third quarter of 20, the industry. This increase was primarily due to a surge in recycling volume generated from Apple's official trading program. However, that had a limited impact on our operating cash flow since we have our payment term of 45 days and effectively managing relevant payables through bank guarantees.\r\n As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and funds receivable from sort of partly payment of service providers totaled 2.9 billion.

So that allows us to repurchase up to $20 million worth of our shares over the next 12 months is based on our confidence in our value creation, finish growth momentum and strong cash flow.\r\n Now turning to the business outlook. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues to be between 3,550 million and three some of 650 million, representing an increase of 23.6% to 27.1% year over year. Please note that this forecast only reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions which are subject to change.\r\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator instructions) Joyce Ju, Bank of America.\n\nJoyce Ju\n\nAnd designing Covansys will accumulate going to close, which should be able to put in the 80s with 70 centers are going to come from a 1033 ended then down to eight women that was a year with yields at the outlets into Libya.

I mean, if you step back and essentially Sundar permit on that.\r\n Well, thank you for your question. During 2022 and 2023, we saw a shift in consumer behavior. Our users' focus transition from consumption upgrades to emphasize on value for money during this transformation, we noticed a shift right fleet, the right user demand for trillions and recycling in exchange for cash. As we mentioned, our 1Q revenue grew 34.4% year-over-year in 2023 was trade is still clearly more than doubling compared to the previous year. We will continue to drive the core growth flywheel of 1T Rocephin business and to extend our industrial operating profit margin further by bringing our operational efficiency to the next level, we are steadfast in investing in the brand of interest to recycle to unleash growth of traffic and economy of scale.\r\n Further, in terms of our platform business, we've strengthened the synergies between TJC. marketplace and other marketplaces that and provide a small merchants with upgraded consignments services. This helped us build a more robust to supply and meant we could offer a more diverse selection of high-quality secondhand products to our users and looking ahead to 21 for workplace user experience as our top priority and while providing the utmost support to the restocking and trading offerings of JD.com and Apple's official training program. We believe that the support from the central government for large scale trading policies and consumer goods will benefit our collaborations with JD and brand partner together, we elevate consumer awareness of trading and cost ratio has been made during consumption twice. Because of this.\n\nJoyce Ju\n\nWe are confident in achieving a 30% year-over-year revenue growth for our OneTEAM business, why you thought in the equally so on the US and in Toby, Nadir, so you got more agents helpful at CONMED.

T cells.\n\nXuefeng Chen\n\nIf we saw the drop-off in 2023 in January for our multi-category second business, about 1 million army. This business has grown rapidly in sales. We set a model take rate for this business segment in 2003, we trust there is ample growth potential in the take rate in 2024, our focus is enhancing user awareness of a transfer cycle as the leading national recycling brands, our core strategy is to fail to build an even better user experience. To achieve this, we will provide more structured products into our platform and improve our pricing capabilities. This will drive more recycling transactions across a wider range of categories.\n\nOperator\n\nJunyun Chen, CITIC.\n\nJunyun Chen\n\nThank you, Kim, and thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good results. I have two questions. First, could you provide more color on the higher than expected profitability this year? And what's your profitability target for 2024 and for the medium to long term?\r\n And second in late 2023 and already 2020 for the iPhone 15 series of face some challenges from Huawei. How does management view the challenging commodity landscape, a more optimal biopharma manufacturers? And how did your Apollo trading business performed in Q4 2023? And what are your scale and profit targets for 2024?\n\nXuefeng Chen\n\nThanks to our very own joint venture into cancer going tangential, Akiva goes to constitute a degree or two below tied to that yet, will that Lynch the differentiation of 19,000 tons to Teradata as Danielle, you entitled to any of the different science to address us from you if you don't have to constantly review the GE crush at semaglutide and you haven't seen a change going forward on our own to the iPhone short-selling attack or amateur Trulia 20 Jasmine tornado milling unit to show you how it began. Glad to have one-time Google to come back in financial challenges and are going to be our peak quarter to one point. Joe, quick question on your sensitivity to gas in some. Yes, RCM growth, any growth going or will you move down? Sorry.\r\n Okay. Thank you. So I will take your first question and I carry out your with the kiosk. Second, the questions. Okay. So for our first submission in 2023, we once again achieved breakthroughs in terms of cost efficiencies. And then in capital measures, fulfillment, selling and marketing, G&A and other administrative and technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenues for 8.5%, 7.3% and 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. These figures correspond to a year-over-year decrease of 2.4% to 1.6% and 0.1% and 0.6% respectively.\r\n In terms of fulfillment, we achieved a remarkable efficiency improvement, our efficient system of production to offer incentives and a centralized self-operated operation stations have further improve our inspection quality and cost conscious skewing effect created by the use of automation. Technology at shopping centers has also had a positive impact. We are now seeing lower costs related to sourcing quoting, especially in the warehouse when compared to our previous approach of using decentralized jointly operated stations, we have also leveraged data to optimize small items deleverage with low cost of ownership. This has driven down shipping and receiving costs of all our operations center expenses in logistics costs decreased by 9% and 8%, respectively. During 2023. This resulted in Yunnan CapEx limited expense of 1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of around 2%. Our total net GAAP selling and marketing expenses in the travel industry was 940 million. This was a year-over-year increase of 7.8%. Also a lot lower than all our revenue growth rate over the same period this was mainly driven by HR efficiency improvements from deploying advanced digital CRM tools of the P2P sales team. The results was a 19% cost reduction compared to the pervious year 1423, Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, 190 million, a year-over-year increase of 21.9%. This was mainly due to office grant and various other administrative costs, including employee travel, training and benefits. Our Non-GAAP technology and content expenses were 170 million in 2023, thanks to the gradual maturation of our platforms at a margin. That's our official launch of our South China automation of incentive. We did not see significant cost growth in this category. In addition, as I call them, maturation initiative we launched in 2022 was completed in 2023. This contributed to an overall decrease in technology and content expenses as a percentage of revenue, representing an improvement in scaling effects.\r\n So Brooks, some breakdown above highlights the enhancements satellite to the increasing our non-GAAP operating profit in terms of industry for path to profitability growth, our primary focus of our 1P, gross margin and operating efficiency. Our long-term goal is to improve our non-GAAP operating profit margin by 1% every year.\r\n In terms of our 1P business, we have prioritized ability to control first hand supply while also enhancing user awareness of our C2B Brent, a virtuous cycle. We saw the first hand suppliers with competitor. We're recycling prices. Meanwhile, we continue to unleash our self-operated and refurbishment businesses. While we diversify the standard of supply to pipeline, we expect a larger proportion of 2C sales as we seek a higher profit margin of 1P revenue.\r\n I'd like I'd also like to add more color on our corporate collaboration with Apple. In the fourth quarter, our Apple business achieved sales of 300 million. However, as this business is relatively new and is still being defined as gross profit margins below an ideal level. Going forward, we plan to optimize our pricing mechanism to strike a balance between profitability and growth.\r\n In terms of operating efficiency, we are constantly optimizing our full cost to revenue ratios. Our automation capabilities will continue to improve our fulfillment efficiency, especially cost per device was diluted due to an increase in ASPD.\r\n In terms of selling and marketing, we tried to maximize the effectiveness of our B2B sales team. At the same time, we plan to strategically leverage social media traffic to attract customers. So probable reserves and location. Data service capabilities of short video platforms such as Boeing, will help us target potential users with greater accuracy. This approach has the added benefit to further strengthen our sourcing demographics and the market position. We recognize that the key to building a successful second hand opinions also lies in our ability to acquire supplies through brand at par. As such, our agents through a cycle brand is pivotal to our long-term driver with government passed at this at this stage, we believe strategically allocating appropriate put the soft resources to social media traffic will solidify our long-term competitive position in this dynamic market.\n\nJoyce Ju\n\nOkay, of Dazzle, and he will elaborate on a pink or the tone cautious on?\r\n Well, what you see in other cities such as etsy.com once again, the anomalies of a deal by deal using Yoshida and Okay. So the decency to Shin Ji, the claim of one to four year warrant portfolio was either with our budget. Omega is social media for them. As you also so far, the panel talking now a place of our job for Yahoo. For your laps, the Caisson social elements on Wahler, Panama, ease of use of oil. Can you I would ask digital consumer side and then maybe the timeline shows also finding somebody to go. You can House Counsel has tons of much OpEx. So this is up for Minda Aquasana, PMD, Central European Time. So I mean, you're full you can go eat your lunch in that case or to send essential each of points in the central it higher and Tata Tea symposium levers up almost like increases on the credit box chart, it's clear that in or out of the government of Mali, we adopt CGOV. So that's how we want to push you up taking or plan for you towards the end of the year for you.\r\n So sorry, GBM, Central Europe and quite a male in backup center hockey concern, Jacada key measures.\n\nXuefeng Chen\n\nI will answer the second question, we have systematically roll down our recycling and trading services on behalf of official website. And that 47 flagship stores for service and pricing were highly commended by users. On social media spontaneously.\r\n In terms of scale, we have secured a significant amount of first densify by leveraging the substantial volume of new items shipments in the fourth quarter and by maintaining competitive research and pricing services contributed RMB300 million in product sales revenue during the fourth quarter. This was not this was a meaningful increase compared to the third quarter our suddenly volume is greater than our sales volume. This crude, that user acceptance of ethanol trading for new products is increasing and there is still much room for improvement in the penetration rate of trading products. We will maintain flexible adjustments to our pricing strategy based on market feedback to optimize our gross profit margin. Importantly, we do not handle front-end fulfillment and marketing for the Apple business. As a result, even though this business segment has a narrow gross profit margin, it has the potential to contribute a relatively higher operating profit margin.\n\nJoyce Ju\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nDue to the time limit on the call, I'd like to hand the conference back to management for closing remarks.\n\nJeremy Ji\n\nThank you all again for joining us today, and a replay of today's call will be available on our IR website, shortly followed by a transcript.

        "content": "With the broader indices gaining this year, the time is ripe to check on the best penny stocks on Robinhood.\n\nThe penny stock sector undoubtedly bears its own risks. But if played right, it can offer rewarding potential. For instance, shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had no hope of surpassing the two-dollar barrier in the early 2000s. Yet this year, it reached its all-time high of $927.67, giving it a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Another example is Ford (NYSE:F), when it traded at less than $2 per share during the 2007–2008 worldwide financial crisis. Now, it’s changing hands for $12.11.\n\nWe will look at three penny stocks with similar potential and double-digit upsides you can purchase on Robinhood. The first pick benefits from wider crypto trends, the second from 5G, and the last from the aging American population. Each offers potentially astounding returns for risk-taking investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrypto miner Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is one of the top penny stocks on Robinhood, as Bitcoin and Ethereum zoom past $71,000 and $4,000, respectively.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner⁠ will be one of the main beneficiaries of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run and the next halving. This event is why Bitcoin’s supply is literarily constrained at 21 million. The next one will occur in April. It is commonly observed that the news about the halving often results in a substantial price increase for Bitcoin and crypto stocks. BITF shares, which have already gained 191% over the last year, are in the spotlight.\n\nBitfarms held 804 bitcoins in its treasury as of the end of January. It mined 357 bitcoins in January and sold them all for $15.3 million.\n\nOperational capacity remained consistent with an end-of-month operating hash rate of 6.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). Plans include boosting capacity to 21 EH/s within the year. Additionally, Bitfarms will deploy 11,600 Bitmain T21 miners in Quebec and install 1,920 MicroBT M53S+ miners in Paraguay soon. Also, it has acquired land for a new mining facility in Paraguay.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Bitfarms added 3,888 S21s and 740 S21 hydro miners to its inventory. And, BITF executed options to buy 28,000 Bitmain T21 miners and 19,280 more, boosting its capacity. Moreover, Bitfarms has announced a $375 million at-the-market equity offering program, boosting shareholder returns at a critical stage​​.\n\nTipRanks data indicate that investors willing to buy this stock will potentially gain 86.19% in upside based on a mean target of $4.45.\n\nNokia (NOK) a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foreground\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) was once known for its mobile phone division. However, after losing the race for mobile supremacy to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it pivoted to 5G technology, cloud, and network services.\n\nThanks to investments in 5G, it aims for a double-digit operating margin and a net sales target of around 10 billion Euro by 2026. It focuses on enterprise customers, Cloud RAN, O-RAN, and the defense sector.\n\nThe company wants to evolve its operating model by emphasizing SaaS and Networks as Code. In doing so, it will gain access to consistent recurring cash flow. Nokia investors could also take advantage of the Finnish multinational’s novel merchandise introductions. In addition to the XR20 and G50 phones, NOK is rolling out two more products—G400 and C200 models.\n\nNokia’s patent licensing agreements with key industry participants such as Apple also demonstrate a forward-thinking approach. NOK certainly needs these initiatives to work since the stock is down 22.1% on a one-year basis. It is coming off four quarters of disappointing analyst estimates.\n\nHowever, estimates indicate the stock has a 30% upside potential from current rates, making it one of the best penny stocks to buy on Robinhood.\n\nClover Health Investments (CLOV) Clover Health logo on a phone screen in front of a computer screen showing a map where their services reach. CLOV stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock\n\nClover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV) is one of the best penny stocks to buy on Robinhood if you want to invest in a future-oriented healthcare play.\n\nThe company provides Medicare Advantage insurance plans, aiming to slash costs and improve healthcare outcomes. CLOV is targeting the global Medicare Advantage market. The latter was valued at $456.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $758.5 billion through 2032, according to an analysis from Custom Market Insights.\n\nPlus, the U.S. is aging rapidly, with people 65 and older jumping from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050. As a result, the total number of Medicare beneficiaries will keep growing, proving CLOV stock positive tailwinds.\n\nMeanwhile, the last three quarters have been earnings-beat quarters. Clover Health Investments targets Adjusted EBITDA profitability for the entire fiscal 2024. This will enable it to leverage its technology platform, Clover Assistant. Analysts are projecting an 82.6% upside for the stock based on a mean target price of $1.44.\n\nUnder these circumstances, CLOV establishes itself well among the best penny stocks on Robinhood.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

        "title": "UPDATE 2-Apple retreats in fight to defend App Store in Europe",
        "content": "(Recasts with major concession by Apple, adds company and regulatory details throughout, adds share move)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.\n\nApple announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.\n\nThe changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.\n\nBeginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.\n\nDevelopers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.\n\nThe DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\n\"To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,\" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable \"walled garden,\" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nApple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.\n\nChanges announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.\n\nDevelopers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.\n\nUnder pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco Editing by Mark Potter and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans",
        "content": "For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple, Alphabet and Tesla\n\nThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.\n\nApple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.\n\nThis seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.\n\nAs AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.\n\nAdditionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.\n\nAlphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.\n\nOr course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.\n\nWhile major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.\n\nUntil this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Warren Buffett's investment strategies are widely coveted by investors globally, as the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio has delivered a robust 9.85% compounded annual return over the past 30 years. While Buffett has amassed a majority of his wealth through diversified businesses, his stock investments have also generated billions in passive income alone.\n\nBuffett has long advocated long-term investment strategies in established blue chip companies and has typically condoned avoiding taking immense risks.\n\n\"One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been — and will be — rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes,\" Buffett stated in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s annual shareholder letter.\n\nSome of Buffett's profitable investment bets have been in large-cap dividend-paying stocks.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nBuffett describes his stake in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) as his \"secret sauce,\" as the company's immense dividend payouts account for a sizable portion of Berkshire's earnings.\n\nBuffett acquired his stake in American Express for $1.3 billion in 1995, but its annual earnings in 2023 \"considerably exceeded\" the cost of purchase. In addition, his total stake in American Express was valued at roughly $22 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nBuffett's investment in American Express accounts for 4% to 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net worth, while the total dividend earnings from the stake amounted to nearly $302 million in fiscal 2022. The investment guru predicts American Express's dividend payouts to increase by 16% in 2024.\n\nWhile Buffett did not purchase or sell any shares of American Express in 2023, his ownership stake in the company rose marginally because of Berkshire's share repurchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments that could add significant income to your portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) is another one of Buffett's hidden gems, as its dividend payouts make a sizable paycheck for one of the world's richest men. Buffett invested a total of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola in 1994 and cashed in $704 million in dividends annually by 2022.\n\n\"Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays,\" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter. \"We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.\"\n\nIn addition, Berkshire Hathaway's total stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion, reflecting an over 1,800% capital appreciation.\n\nApple\n\nBuffett claimed that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is \"a better business than anything we own.\" He had a 5.9% stake in Apple as of Dec. 31, 2023, making it one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. The Magnificent Seven stock has grown by over 365% since the end of 2018, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500's returns.\n\nHowever, Buffett sold nearly 1% of his stake in Apple in the last quarter of 2023. While concerns regarding Apple's operational challenges have caused the stock to plummet by more than 12% so far this year, analysts remain bullish regarding the tech giant's long-term growth prospects.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250, reflecting a potential upside of nearly 50%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Samik Chatterjee maintains a similar Overweight rating on Apple, with a price target of $215, indicating a potential upside of over 27%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $364 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "Given his wide recognition as one of the world's greatest capital allocators, it's no surprise that individual investors love to look at Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's gigantic $364 billion portfolio for stock ideas.\n\nAmong the top holdings is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up a whopping 43% of the entire portfolio. The Oracle of Omaha first purchased this FAANG stock in early 2016, and since the start of that year to March 8, it has skyrocketed 375%. This is undoubtedly one of Buffett's most lucrative bets.\n\nInvestors can gain insights by figuring out the factors that led to Apple's prominent place in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nA screaming buying opportunity\n\nWhile we can't read Buffett's mind, we know that he appreciates high-quality businesses first and foremost. Apple certainly fit the bill in 2016.\n\nA key part of its economic moat is the powerful brand. Apple is a technological and cultural icon, thanks to its incredibly popular hardware devices, the most notable of which is the iPhone. This single product generated $201 billion of sales in fiscal 2023.\n\nLook through Berkshire's top holdings, and it's obvious he appreciates strong brands. Coca-Cola and American Express are two large positions whose brands resonate mightily with consumers.\n\nApple's brand holds so much weight that it allows the business to flex its pricing power, another trait Buffett likes to see. People have no problem paying up for expensive products, often just to upgrade to the latest version. Add on Apple's growing services offerings, and the company is able to keep its users engaged and loyal.\n\nIn fiscal 2015, the year before Buffett scooped up the stock for the first time, Apple reported a gross margin of 39% and an operating margin of 30%. This was and still is a ridiculously profitable enterprise, generating $81 billion of operating cash flow that year.\n\nSound financial performance is something the Oracle of Omaha wants from his businesses. Apple's pristine balance sheet also reduces the risk that the company will ever run into money troubles. That probably explains why Buffett was so comfortable letting the Apple holding become such a huge position in the portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can't ignore valuation as a critical factor. During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10.6. Investors were worried about something that caused such a depressed valuation. But based on all of its impressive qualities, it was clear that the market got it wrong.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, adding Apple to Berkshire's portfolio eight years ago looked like a no-brainer decision for Buffett.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock right now?\n\nApple has been a fantastic investment. And because Berkshire still owns a sizable stake, investors probably want to buy the stock right now.\n\nBut because the shares have performed so extraordinarily well, they aren't cheap anymore. In fact, I believe they are now overvalued. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 26.6 today. That's much higher than what Buffett paid in 2016.\n\nIf Apple was staring at tremendous growth opportunities in the years ahead, then maybe one could justify paying that steep of a valuation. However, I don't think that's the case anymore. This is a very mature company. Revenue declined 2.8% in fiscal 2023. And Wall Street analysts believe sales will increase at an annual pace of just 4.2% during the next three years.\n\nApple is one of the world's most outstanding businesses. No one will argue with that. But it's no longer a solid investment candidate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple made a major concession in its battle to protect the dominance of its App Store on iPhones and other devices in Europe on Tuesday, saying developers will be free to distribute their apps directly to consumers.\n\nApple announced the changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week. The changes could dent the high profit margins and steady stream of revenue that Apple has come to rely on from its App store, where it charges developers fees of up to 30%.\n\nThe changes, which affect only the European Union, come amid continuing criticism from rivals that Apple's compliance efforts are falling short.\n\nBeginning this spring, software developers operating in Europe will be able to distribute apps to EU customers directly from their own websites instead of through the App Store.\n\nDevelopers must still meet terms and conditions set by Apple and be authorized developers. Apple has also introduced a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year, even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system.\n\nThe DMA aims to rein in Apple, Amazon, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\n\"To reflect the DMA’s changes, users in the EU can install apps from alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4 and later. Users will be able to download an alternative marketplace app from the marketplace developer’s website,\" Apple said on its website. IOS refers to the software platform that runs Apple's iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe opening in Europe of Apple's ecosystem, which the company has long guarded as a highly profitable \"walled garden,\" comes at a sensitive time for the tech giant.\n\nThe iPhone maker is struggling with shrinking revenue and weak demand for its smartphones in China. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging its Big Tech rivals in their race to dominate artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's stock was up 0.6% on Tuesday afternoon, reducing its loss in 2024 to 10%.\n\nChanges announced on Tuesday include letting developers set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalogue solely made up of the developer's own apps with immediate effect.\n\nDevelopers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.\n\nUnder pressure from regulators and the DMA, Apple last week took a step back in its feud with Epic Games, allowing it to put its own game store on iPhones and iPads in Europe. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple has also said it will appeal an EU antitrust fine of 1.84 billion euros ($2 billion) handed to it last week for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on the App Store.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San FranciscoEditing by Mark Potter and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will allow European users to download iPhone applications from web platforms for the first time as it moves to step into line with European Union rules targeting Big-Tech dominance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring Back China Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US Wheat Stock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap Boeing Whistleblower Who Raised Safety Concerns Found Dead\n\nAs part of the overhaul, Apple will also let developers offer discounts to users away from the app store and will permit third-party marketplaces to offer their own developed apps.\n\nMost of the changes will be put into effect immediately, except for Apple’s offer to allow developers to distribute apps from websites, which will launch in the spring, the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe overhaul is Apple’s latest in a round of tweaks linked to compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which went into force this month. The law targets the dominance of platforms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s App Store, Amazon.com Inc.’s marketplace and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook in an attempt to improve competition. Those firms must comply with a range of rules or face significant penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s annual worldwide revenue or up to 20% for repeat offenders.\n\nRead More: Apple on Collision Course With EU as Digital Law Kicks In\n\nApple’s rejigs have attracted mounting pressure from regulators and competitors. Last week it said it would restore a developer account for Epic Games Inc. — allowing the Fortnite maker to build its own EU app store, which could compete with Apple’s own. The reversal came a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker.\n\nRead More: Apple Reverses Move to Ban ‘Fortnite’ Maker From the EU\n\nThe company was also hit with a €1.8 billion fine in the EU this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. Apple’s appealing the penalty and has said that regulators failed to uncover any “credible evidence of consumer harm.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple made other moves to bring the App Store into compliance in the EU this year, including restructuring the fee it charges developers. The company scrapped its 30% commission for a cheaper rate of 17%. Instead, it implemented a 3% processing charge for apps that use Apple’s in-app purchasing system and a 50 cent fee per app install for software that’s downloaded more than 1 million times in a 12-month period.\n\nThe EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg last week that “the DMA is quite specific, also when it comes to having a fee structure that actually enables people to use these new benefits.”\n\nApple, along with Meta and TikTok, is fighting its designation as a “gatekeeper” in the EU courts. TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. last month lost a court bid to suspend the EU’s decision while the appeal is pending, forcing the video-sharing app social-media platform to comply with new regulation.\n\nEurope’s Two-Track Approach to Policing Big Tech: QuickTake\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom Luxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US How Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built Gold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

This next-gen technology is set to revolutionize telecommunications and boasts speeds up to 100X faster than 4G.\n\nWith significantly lower latency, 5G can process more data and shorten the time it takes to travel between devices. This translates into smoother streaming, faster downloads and the potential to unlock entirely new applications. As this emerging technology continues to permeate global markets, investor interest for 5G technology will surge over the next decade.\n\nNow, let’s discover the three best 5G stocks to buy in March 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands in the top spot for the best 5G stocks to buy in March. The semiconductor behemoth is a leader in the 5G revolution and is set to benefit from IoT and AI tailwinds in FY24.\n\nQualcomm’s technological prowess extends to various mobile communications standards, including the widely used 4G and 5G networks. The company holds a significant number of patents for these technologies, along with CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA. Additionally, it has begun an aggressive push into the generative AI market with the release of Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nIn Qualcomm’s latest quarterly results, revenue increased 5% YOY to $9.9 billion. EPS increased by 24% to $2.46 per share. It continues to see positive signs for a rebound in the handset market, and continue to make key investments into generative AI. This includes the release of the company’s AI CPU called Snapdragon X Elite, expected to deliver 2X faster performance. Furthermore, it is capable of running generative AI models with over 13 billion parameters set to power the PC market in mid-2024.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) the exterior of a T-Mobile (TMUS) branded store\n\nSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a major American wireless network operator, boasting the title as the third largest telecommunications company in the United States. The company recently closed off a strong 2023 fiscal year, and management has a strong outlook for 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile offers a wide range of services for its customers, including mobile phone plans with data, voice and text options. As of December 2023, the company boasted nearly 118 million subscribers and have the largest 5G footprint covering 98% of Americans. It focuses on network connectivity and high data speeds, boasting a robust 5G network covered by ultra capacity 5G. This translated into industry-leading growth adding 1.3 million net account additions in 2023.\n\nIn FY23, T-Mobile’s revenue was flat but the company saw significant bottom line and FCF growth. Net income increased 221% YOY to $8.3 billion, with adjusted FCF up 77% to $13.6 billion. Management is forecasting a strong outlook for 2024, guiding net customer additions of more than 5 million and adjusted EBITDA between $31.3 – $31.9 billion. This makes TMUS stock one of the top 5G stocks to buy before it makes new highs in 2024.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSE:FIVG) is not a 5G stock but is one of the perfect ways to gain exposure to 5G stocks. It is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is designed to capture the growth and commercialization of 5G network infrastructure.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF invests in a basket of the top companies across the 5G ecosystem. This includes a wide range of areas including carrier equipment, 5G chips, radio communications, cloud computing and mobile network operators. FIVG seeks to track the BlueStar Global 5G Communications Index, and holds 49 U.S. listed stocks with diversified exposure to 5G technology.\n\nSome of the industry giants in the FIVG ETF include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The ETF may be suitable for investors who want to diversify and not put all their eggs into one basket. However, it is important to know that the ETF has an expense ratio of .30%. If you’re a long-term believer in the global rollout of 5G network infrastructure, FIGV should be kept on your radar in March 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paying countries for business analysts. We have also discussed the demand and importance of business analysts. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Business Analysts.\n\nWhy Are Business Analysts Important?\n\nBy 2025, IDC forecasts a high growth in worldwide data, projecting it to reach a mind-boggling 175 zettabytes, with a 61% increase from the current 33 zettabytes. This exponential increase confirms the monumental challenge of managing such colossal volumes, with data dispersed across three key domains: the core, edge, and endpoints.\n\nIDC's \"Data Age 2025\" report, sponsored by Seagate, highlights the transformative impact of this data explosion. Notably, the storage industry is set to ship 42 zettabytes of capacity within the next seven years, while IoT devices are projected to generate 90 zettabytes of data by 2025. With nearly half of this data expected to reside in public cloud environments and around 30% consumed in real-time, the landscape of data management and utilization is undergoing a seismic shift, demanding innovative solutions to navigate this data deluge.\n\nTherefore, in today’s day and age, business analysts are indispensable to modern enterprises as they navigate the ever-expanding sea of data. In 2024, when decision-making heavily relies on data-driven insights, business analysts serve as the linchpin. They translate complex datasets into actionable information, guiding strategic choices that shape the trajectory of organizations. Despite the abundance of data, the challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights efficiently. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be a crucial ally, empowering analysts to sift through vast datasets rapidly, identify patterns, and predict future trends.\n\nMoreover, AI democratizes data accessibility, enabling non-analytical stakeholders to comprehend insights effectively. By capitalizing on AI, analysts can focus more on strategic analysis rather than mundane tasks, thus maximizing their potential impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, in today's tumultuous retail landscape, the importance of analytics cannot be overstated. Facing challenges like labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the threat of climate change, retailers are turning to data-driven insights for guidance. These analytics come in various forms, from descriptive and diagnostic to predictive and prescriptive, helping retailers understand consumer behavior, manage inventory efficiently, and empower their associates. For instance, by leveraging cloud-based analytics, retailers can optimize inventory placement across hundreds of stores, enhancing sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, innovative approaches like using AI-powered robots to monitor inventory levels offer practical solutions to the supply-and-demand puzzle. Owing to the growing importance of business analysts, it is also one of the highest paying jobs for the future.\n\nTop Skills for Business Analysts to Learn in 2024\n\nIn the 2023, State of Social Media report, we discovered some interetesing findings: 80% of businesses expect a social media budget increase within three years, with 44% predicting a rise of over 50%. 90% emphasize the importance of capitalizing on social data for strategic decision-making. Moreover, 97% recognize the role of AI and ML in efficient data analysis. Leaders are gearing up to harness emerging technologies to maximize social media's impact. As social platforms evolve into indispensable business tools, adept utilization of data and AI has become paramount for competitive advantage. From these stats, we infer that it is high time business analysts learn machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness data-driven insights, predict trends, and optimize business processes. ML and AI empower analysts to extract valuable patterns from vast datasets, enabling informed decision-making and competitive advantage.\n\nTo read more about skills in demand, see the most In Demand Skills for Freelancers.\n\nHighest Paying Companies for Business Analysts\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are two of the highest paying companies for business analysts in 2024 with average annual salaries of $171,988 and $169.015 respectively, according to Glassdoor.com.\n\nSpeaking on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the company’s ascension to the third most valuable US company has confirmed the growing prominence of artificial intelligence in investment circles.

        "title": "Apple’s hysterics over the new EU antitrust law have led to two climbdowns already—and the law hasn’t even been in force for a week",
        "content": "European Commission 2–Apple 0.\n\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act has been in place for less than five days, and its enforcers have already pushed Apple into two humiliating U-turns. If Apple has been trying to test how much it can throw its weight around in its increasingly hilarious hissy-fit over the new Big Tech antitrust law, it’s had its answer now.\n\nThe first reversal came earlier this month when Apple meekly agreed to let home screen web apps continue functioning as intended on iPhones. It had previously killed off the entire category on the basis of protecting users’ security under a rather odd reading of the DMA. The Commission threatened an investigation, and Apple retreated.\n\nThen, on Friday, Apple agreed to reinstate a developer account for arch-nemesis Epic Games, effectively allowing it to roll out a third-party iOS app store (an actual DMA demand) and also finally return Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU.\n\nApple’s reason for axing Epic’s account was that Epic had previously violated Apple’s policy by launching an alternative to Apple’s payment system for in-app payments (which is why Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store in 2020). Apple had also argued that Epic’s criticism of Apple’s new EU business model meant it couldn’t be trusted to follow the terms for third-party app stores, even though Epic had promised to abide by them. Apple’s reasoning was doubly ludicrous because a) the Commission wants affected companies to give feedback on Big Tech’s attempts to comply with the DMA, and b) Apple claimed a California court ruling gave it the ability to cancel Epic’s developer accounts anytime it wanted, anywhere in the world.\n\nAfter the Commission again threatened an investigation—and presumably after Apple’s lawyers googled “jurisdiction”—the company again backed down. “I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,” cackled Commission digital chief Thierry Breton in an X post. “From Day 2, [the] DMA is already showing very concrete results!”\n\nStory continues\n\nI think at this point it’s fair to say that Tim Cook’s team has been massively overreaching in its response to the DMA. But hey, nobody ever said compliance with EU tech law was easy.\n\nYou know who else just learned that lesson? The European Commission.\n\nThis morning, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)—the privacy regulator that specifically keeps an eye on big EU institutions—slammed the Commission for breaking a 2018 data-protection law in how its staff use Microsoft 365. The watchdog said the Commission had failed to implement safeguards to ensure that people’s personal data is only being sent to countries whose data-protection rules are equivalent to the EU’s. What’s more, the Commission hadn’t been properly specifying what types of personal data would be collected in the use of Microsoft 365, and what the data would be used for, as the law demands. (This isn't the well-known General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, but rather a special companion law that only applies to the EU institutions.)\n\nAs a result, the Commission will have to “suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the [EU and European Economic Area]\" that lack adequate privacy protections. It’s unclear which countries the watchdog means. The EDPS has given the Commission until early December to comply, reflecting how difficult it will be to comply with the decision without majorly disrupting the Commission’s work.\n\nThe Commission insists that its use of Microsoft 365 is legally compliant; it’s studying the EDPS’s order before deciding how to respond. But, it said in a statement, “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the current high level of mobile and integrated IT services. This applies not only to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services.”\n\nFairly or not, I suspect quite a few Silicon Valley regulatory officers will be chuckling at the irony of the situation.

        "title": "15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.\n\nThe impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment.\n\nIn view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ. 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

        "title": "Which Megacap Stock Has the Greatest GAAP Net Worth? Hint: It's Not Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia.",
        "content": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the biggest company of all? That might seem like an easy question to answer. Just use a stock screen that sorts by descending market cap.\n\nFor much of the past few years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) claimed the biggest market cap of all publicly traded companies. Thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) took over the No. 1 spot earlier in 2024. This AI boost has also put Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) within striking distance of the top position.\n\nBut the real answer to the question depends on how you define \"biggest.\" Warren Buffett recently discussed the biggest company based on net worth as measured by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). And it isn't Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia.\n\nWhat is GAAP net worth?\n\nGAAP net worth is better known by another name -- book value. It's also sometimes referred to as shareholder's equity.\n\nThe calculation of GAAP net worth is straightforward:\n\nDetermine a company's total assets (found on its balance sheet) Determine the company's total liabilities (also on the balance sheet) Subtract total liabilities from total assets to get the GAAP net worth\n\nThere's also an even simpler way to find a company's GAAP net worth. Just look at the value for total stockholders' (or shareholders') equity on the balance sheet.\n\nMicrosoft's market cap tops $3 trillion. The tech giant's GAAP net worth, though, is a much lower $238.3 billion.\n\nIt's a similar story for Apple. The iPhone maker has a market cap of more than $2.6 trillion. But Apple's GAAP net worth is only $74.1 billion.\n\nThe difference is even more pronounced for Nvidia. Although the chipmaker's market cap has skyrocketed to over $2.3 trillion, its GAAP net worth is a little under $43 billion.\n\nThe biggest by far\n\nSo if the largest company based on GAAP net worth isn't Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia, which company holds the No. 1 spot? Since I mentioned Buffett earlier, you can probably guess who the U.S. winner is. It's his own Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's GAAP net worth stood at nearly $561.3 billion. The conglomerate is more than twice the size of Microsoft based on the metric. It's nearly 7.6 times bigger than Apple and over 13 times larger than Nvidia.\n\nBerkshire boasts the largest GAAP net worth by far of any U.S. business in history, according to Buffett in his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders. He noted that the total GAAP net worth for the S&P 500 excluding Berkshire was $8.9 trillion in 2022. While the total hasn't been calculated yet for 2023, Buffett doesn't think that it will be much higher than $9.5 trillion. He pointed out that Berkshire by itself makes up roughly 6% of the total GAAP net worth of the entire S&P 500.\n\nBut while Berkshire has the biggest GAAP net worth among U.S. companies, there's a company outside the U.S. that's even bigger. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the GAAP net worth for giant oil and gas producer Saudi Aramco totaled $1.75 trillion.\n\nA better metric than market cap or GAAP net worth\n\nWhy don't Berkshire Hathaway and Saudi Aramco get more props for being the biggest companies based on GAAP net worth? There are some drawbacks to using the financial metric. For example, asset values can sometimes be understated or overstated. Intangible assets are especially tricky to accurately value.\n\nMarket cap still matters. However, there's perhaps an even better measurement for determining the biggest companies -- enterprise value (EV). This metric adds a company's market cap and its total debt then subtracts cash and equivalents.\n\nWhat's the biggest megacap company based on EV? Microsoft comes out on top, just as it does based on market cap.\n\nFor investors, though, how much a company can grow is more important than how big it is now. There are plenty of stocks that are likely to grow faster than Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, or Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Bought Shares of This Stock for 22 Consecutive Quarters -- and It's Not Apple or Occidental",
        "content": "There are a number of great money managers on Wall Street, but few, if any, can hold a candle to the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" Warren Buffett. Since Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a greater than 4,900,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nPatient investors have become financially independent mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's investments. This can be done by analyzing Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the most recent quarter.\n\nBut while Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have clued investors into a number of businesses Buffett appreciates, the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy -- one which he's added to for 22 consecutive quarters -- won't be found on his company's 13F. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple and Occidental Petroleum have been popular buys, but neither is Buffett's favorite stock\n\nA quick glance at Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio would appear to suggest that tech stockApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is Warren Buffett's favorite business. After all, it accounted for 42.5% of invested assets as of the closing bell on March 6.\n\nInnovation is a big reason Apple held the title of world's largest publicly traded company for so long (it only recently ceded this title to Microsoft). Since upgrading iPhone to handle 5G speeds in late 2020, the company's flagship smartphone has accounted for half or more of domestic smartphone market share. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't understand the mechanics of how an iPhone works, he fully understands consumer behavior and the exceptional loyalty of Apple's customers to its products.\n\nBut what investors may have overlooked is Apple's innovation beyond its physical products. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing an extended transformation that has Apple focused on various subscription services. Subscriptions should smooth out Apple's revenue recognition during iPhone upgrade cycles, steadily lift the company's operating margin over time, and encourage Apple's customers to stay within the company's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the best aspect of owning a lot of Apple stock for Warren Buffett might be its unbeatable capital-return program. Apple is returning $14.8 billion annually in dividends to its shareholders, and has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett is a huge fan of businesses that reward long-term-minded investors like himself.\n\nThe other stock in Berkshire's portfolio that you'd probably think is Warren Buffett's favorite to buy is energy juggernaut Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Since the beginning of 2022, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have purchased more than 248 million shares of Occidental -- a position with a market value of $15.2 billion.\n\nAlthough energy stocks haven't played a big role in Berkshire's portfolio throughout much of this century, the past couple of years have represented something of a change of heart for Buffett and his team. Piling into Occidental the way Berkshire's investment team has signals that they believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms, or perhaps head even higher.\n\nWhile it's tough to predict the directional movements of energy commodities with any certainty, there are factors working in Buffett's favor. For instance, capital underinvestment for multiple years from energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, it's not uncommon for the price of that commodity to rise.\n\nA higher spot price for crude oil would be noteworthy for two reasons for Occidental. First, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. If the price of oil climbs, it disproportionately benefits, when compared to other integrated oil and gas operators.\n\nSecondly, Occidental is still digging itself out of debt. The company is counting on a higher spot price to fuel the steady paydown of its remaining debt. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeet the stock Warren Buffett has purchased for 22 consecutive quarters\n\nThough it's abundantly clear that Apple and Occidental Petroleum are core holdings in the $361 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, neither stock has been purchased by the Oracle of Omaha for 22 consecutive quarters.\n\nTo find Warren Buffett's favorite stock, investors will want to peer beyond the company's 13Fs and take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Contained within these operating results is a section on share repurchases. That's right -- the stock Buffett genuinely can't stop buying is shares of his own company.\n\nShare buybacks at Berkshire Hathaway took a big turn in mid-July 2018. Prior to this point, repurchases could only be undertaken if the company's shares traded at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire Hathaway's stock never retreated to or below this preset threshold, the company went years without any share repurchases.\n\nEverything changed on July 17, 2018, which is when Berkshire's board reworked the covenants governing share repurchases to allow Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger to work their magic.\n\nUnder the new criteria, as long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and both Buffett and Munger agreed that shares of their company were intrinsically cheap, buybacks could continue with no preset cap.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett oversaw the repurchase of 3,623 Class A shares and 660,585 Class B shares (BRK.B) of Berkshire stock at a total cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the criteria for buybacks changed in July 2018, Buffett has bought back more than $74 billion worth of his company's stock, with repurchases occurring every single quarter.\n\nThe reason the Oracle of Omaha and his team spend such a small fortune on buybacks is because it's the easiest way to reward investors who share their long-term vision. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regular buybacks are incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, buying back stock can lift earnings per share (EPS) for businesses with steady or growing net income. As Berkshire's outstanding share count shrinks over an extended period, EPS should increase. Ideally, this makes Berkshire Hathaway appear even cheaper to investors.\n\nRegardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, Warren Buffett buying back shares of his favorite stock, Berkshire Hathaway, is a virtual given.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Appear Poised to Become Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Since this year began, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite have powered to record-closing highs. While there have been patches of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have done the bulk of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent some of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap (as of the closing bell on March 5, 2024), the Magnificent Seven are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are industry-leading businesses with impressive moats\n\nWhat makes the Magnificent Seven so special is their sustained competitive advantages.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure is the world's rapidly growing No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services, while Windows remains the global leader among desktop operating systems. Apple has been a pioneer in smartphone innovation for more than a decade, and offers a share repurchase program that no other publicly traded company can match. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate in AI-accelerated data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global No. 1 cloud infrastructure service platform. Alphabet's Google had a monopoly like 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure. Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.\n\nForget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 stock split. Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split. Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split. Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nGiven that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.\n\nFor example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.\n\nWhat's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.\n\nAdd in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.\n\nInstead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.\n\nAlthough Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.\n\nThe company's social media \"real estate\" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.\n\nWhat all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.\n\nAnd unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.\n\nMicrosoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.\n\nIn terms of \"high-growth initiatives,\" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.\n\nMicrosoft's AI ambitions are also on display.

        "title": "A Third \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.\n\nAlphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.\n\nWatching where a stock has been\n\nThe 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.\n\nFor example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign. NVDA Chart\n\nThe 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock. GOOGL Chart\n\nNotice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.\n\nIn the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.\n\nUnderstanding market sentiment\n\nA great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.\n\nIf you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.\n\nAnother recent example is Target(NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.\n\nIn sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.\n\nUsing moving averages to your advantage\n\nThe best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.\n\nIn other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.\n\nIt happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.\n\nThe point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.\n\nWhat the Alphabet sell-off tells us\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.\n\nApple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.\n\nThe market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).\n\nThe market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.\n\nAlphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats story moved on Friday without change to text)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Commonwealth Bank of Australia Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn renewed his warning on Apple Inc.’s power over the nation’s payments market, reigniting a years-long dispute about competition in a booming area of finance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring Back These Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats ‘Oppenheimer’ Wins Seven Oscars Including Best Picture, Director Slow US Inflation Retreat Is Set to Bolster Fed Patience on Rate Cuts\n\n“They should be subjected to a lot more scrutiny in Australia,” Comyn said at a conference in Sydney on Monday.\n\nIn a fracas that has lasted years, Comyn has pushed for more competition and has told a parliamentary inquiry that customers should be able to decide which features they prefer in wallet apps. Apple, which is a partner and also a competitor for domestic banks, doesn’t give access to the near field communication chip on its iPhones, and instead requires banks to send payments using Apple Pay.\n\n“They are very sophisticated companies who are playing a very deliberate game and it should be a very clear agenda item for government and policymakers,” Comyn said, referring to the US technology giant. He was speaking at the AFR Business Summit in Sydney.\n\nMacquarie Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Shemara Wikramanayake, speaking on a panel at the same conference later in the day, said she won’t buy into the regulation of the so-called Magnificent Seven, companies that do “an amazing job for the US and the world.”\n\n“The US and the world does need to allow other competition to come in, but that’s something for regulators to sort out,” she said when asked whether the Australian government should place more attention on Apple’s market power.\n\n“Basically we take the world as we see it and work with it. They’re contributing a lot and we’re focusing on the positive in how we engage with them,” she said.\n\nComyn also reiterated his opinion on hybrid work, a policy which requires his staff to spend at least 50% of their time in the office. This contrasts with some US banks that have pushed workers back to the office up to five-days-a-week.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Hybrid is here to stay,” he said.\n\n(Adds comments from Macquarie CEO on regulation from fifth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Barbenheimer Gives the Oscars Some Much Needed Juice\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Apple reverses course, allows Epic Games to launch Fortnite app in EU",
        "content": "Apple reversed its decision to block Fortnite video game developer Epic Games from launching its own online marketplace for iPhones and iPads in Europe on Friday and has now cleared the way.\n\nLast Wednesday, Apple escalated a longstanding feud with Epic Games by blocking the game maker from launching its own online marketplace.\n\nThe two companies have been involved in a legal battle since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust rules by charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iPhone Operating System (iOS) devices.\n\nApple’s decision to allow Epic to proceed with its plans follows the European Union’s deadline last Thursday, requiring big tech companies to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a set of rules banning Apple and Google from controlling which apps can be distributed on devices with iOS or Android operating systems.\n\nAPPLE ESCALATES EPIC GAMES FEUD BY BLOCKING FORTNITE APP IN EU Epic Games logo of a video game and software developer is seen on a smartphone screen.\n\nRegulators reportedly warned Apple about its decision to block Epic’s potential return, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts, Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,\" Breton posted on X. \"From Day 2, #DMA is already showing very concrete results.\"\n\nEpic ultimately lost its court battle on U.S. antitrust rules violations, and the game maker’s plan to break Apple’s rules in protest got the popular Fortnite game banned from Apple devices. And while Friday’s decision is a victory for Epic, it still falls short of everything it would like from Apple.\n\nAPPLE IPHONE SALES IN CHINA PLUMMET 24% AS HUAWEI SMARTPHONE SALES SURGE The Apple logo is seen on the outside of Bill Graham Civic Auditorium before the start of an event in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016.\n\nStill, Epic has been anything but silent about Apple’s recent decisions on the matter.\n\nOn March 6, Epic posted on X that Apple terminated its developer account, adding the company can no longer develop the Epic Games Store for iOS.\n\n\"This is a serious violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act,\" Epic posted. \"We will continue to fight to get back on iOS!\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAPPLE HIT WITH NEARLY $2B EU ANTITRUST FINE In this photo illustration the online video game by Epic Games company Fortnite logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background.\n\nApple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. Epic had created the account in an effort to put Fortnite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices. Apple must allow third-party stores on its devices, under the new European law.\n\nThe developer accounts are important because software creators cannot distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without one. Apple had previously terminated some of Epic's developer accounts in 2020, after Epic purposely broke Apple's in-app payment rules, using its violation of the rules and subsequent banishment from the App Store as the core of public relations and legal campaign against Apple.\n\nTwo days after terminating the developer account, Apple had reversed its decision and Epic changed its tone.\n\nAPPLE'S NEW MACBOOK AIR MODELS ROLLING OUT THIS WEEK\n\n\"Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account,\" Epic said on X. \"We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe.\"\n\nAlthough the Epic Games Store will be permitted to launch in Europe, it remains unavailable in the App Store in the U.S.\n\nEpic said it will move on with its plans to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite back to iOS in the continent.\n\n\"This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable,\" Epic Games added.\n\n\"Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies,\" Apple told Fox News Digital. \"As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.\"\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple reverses course, allows Epic Games to launch Fortnite app in EU",

        "title": "Apple MacBook Air 2024 review: The best keeps getting better",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it’s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you’re looking for a Windows laptop.\n\nBut if you’re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that’s no different with the company’s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it’s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.\n\nAvailable March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple’s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.\n\nBoth are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.\n\nMy review unit came equipped with Apple’s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you’re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that’s the exact configuration I’d recommend you buy. It’ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos. Apple's M3-powered MacBook Air offers strong performance and exceptional battery life. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nIf you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.\n\nIf you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you’re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year’s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.\n\nI’m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven’t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn’t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you’re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.\n\nThe latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease. The latest MacBook Air is available with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nBattery life is as fantastic as you’d expect from an Air running on one of Apple’s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I’ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.\n\nOf course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment’s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.\n\nOne of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” thanks to the M3’s built-in neural engine. It’s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn’t exactly some kind of new development. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIt’s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it’s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.\n\nMy only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you’re used to having a connector on your system’s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.\n\nOverall, Apple’s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you’ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you’re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you’re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it’s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple’s chips.\n\nIt’s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year’s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don’t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it’s still a fantastic laptop.\n\nIf you’d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple Could Launch Its Most Important Product Since the iPhone This Summer, According to a Pair of Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) could use a new blockbuster product, and it could come as soon as this summer.\n\nThe iPhone maker saw sales rise just 2% last quarter after a year in which revenue fell 2.8%. China remains a big question mark for Apple following a government ban of iPhones and a report indicating a massive decline in sales in the country to start the year. Meanwhile, the varying sources of its high-margin services revenue remain the focus of regulators around the world.\n\nBut at least two Wall Street analysts think Apple will release the next product to set off a spurt of growth at the massive company this summer. Melius Research analysts Ben Reitzes and Nick Monroe think investors should focus on what Apple will announce this summer at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nApple could \"break new ground\"\n\nAt Apple's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook promised investors the company will \"break new ground\" on generative AI this year.\n\nThe claim follows comments the executive made during Apple's first-quarter earnings call. Cook said, \"We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort\" on AI, and \"I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI.\"\n\nApple recently shuttered its electric car development to focus more on the generative AI projects it's working on. Bloomberg previously reported the company is spending more than $1 billion per year on generative AI. But true to form, Apple hasn't talked much about what it's working on publicly before it's ready to announce a product set for release.\n\nThat's coming this year, Cook says, and very likely planned for WWDC in June.\n\n\"To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone,\" Reitzes and Monroe wrote in a note to investors. They see new AI features as a catalyst for a new iPhone supercycle next year as iPhone users upgrade their hardware to take advantage of new AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's unique position in artificial intelligence\n\nWhile most AI companies are focused on either the hardware (semiconductors) or the software (large language models and applications), Apple, as always, is focused on the combination of the two. That could allow it to leapfrog competitors and push more AI capabilities to consumers.\n\nApple builds some of the most advanced mobile processors on the market for the iPhone. A few years ago, it expanded its designs to its Mac lineup, and it now makes some very powerful chips for desktops and laptops as well. While these chips aren't going to power large language model training, which is mostly handled by remote servers full of GPUs, they may be exactly what's needed for on-device, or \"edge,\" AI applications.\n\nIn other words, new Apple devices may be capable of implementing generative AI all while keeping data securely on a device. That opens the door for a lot more applications and use cases. And Apple could develop software that uses its large language model in a way that takes advantage of its capabilities.\n\nThe big advantage for Apple in monetizing AI\n\nAnother factor that separates Apple from the pack of big tech companies all developing products and services around generative AI is that Apple has multiple ways of monetizing its advancements in AI.\n\nApple has historically made the bulk of its revenue from hardware sales. As Reitzes and Monroe mention in their note, AI advances could push more users to upgrade their iPhones. With over 2.2 billion active devices in use, it could sell a lot of iPhones just by convincing users to upgrade.\n\nMore recently, Apple has focused on growing its services revenue, which leverages that massive user base. Apple could offer a subscription service that gives users more AI features. It could integrate it into its other subscription services like Apple Music and Apple News, or bundle it as part of its Apple One subscription.\n\nApple could also give developers access to its AI models and other tools. That could be monetized through licensing revenue, or as analyst Dan Ives suggests, an \"AI app store.\"\n\nThe key differentiator for Apple is that it owns the platform, and it has several ways to monetize the user base on that platform. While shares currently trade for about 26x forward earnings, that valuation also takes into account Apple's massive cash position and its capital return program. If Apple's AI development proves to be its next big product, it could result in its price-to-earnings multiple expanding as revenue and profit growth reaccelerate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bubble Angst Belied by Big-Tech Weaklings, Broader S&amp;P 500 Gains",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US stocks’ torrid climb to start 2024 is evoking worrisome comparisons with past boom-and-bust cycles on Wall Street, sparking debate over the risk that the market is overheating.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats Billions Pour Into Nigeria as Tinubu’s Reforms Start to Pay Off Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin? Slow US Inflation Retreat Is Set to Bolster Fed Patience on Rate Cuts The $1 Trillion Race to Rebuild Ukraine Is Slowly Getting Going\n\nThere’s ample reason to wonder whether shares have advanced at an unsustainable pace: The S&P 500 Index has closed at record highs 16 times this year, accounting for about a third of all trading days; AI darling Nvidia Corp. has soared nearly 80%, adding roughly $1 trillion in market value, even after sliding Friday along with other tech shares; and speculative areas like Bitcoin have surged.\n\nYet there are signs that the strength, based in large part on the economy’s resilience and robust corporate earnings, hasn’t turned into a speculative frenzy.\n\nSeveral of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks have sputtered, showing that investors aren’t throwing money at the market with abandon. The muted reaction to initial public offerings of late also backs up that notion. What’s more, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 just hit a historic high, indicating the rally is broadening out. And valuations of the benchmark’s biggest stocks are well below levels seen for the market leaders at the height of previous market cycles.\n\nScott Chronert at Citigroup Inc. also notes that the seven megacap tech firms contribute roughly 20% to S&P 500 earnings, which he says largely justifies their market-capitalization weighting of about a third of the gauge.\n\n“There was a premise where you were trying to build out Internet infrastructure back then, much like right now we’re building out AI,” Chronert said. “But the nature of the companies’ revenue and the cash flows that are supporting it are markedly different.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBelow are some charts that may dispel concerns of a bubble forming:\n\nMegacap Divide\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies — Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia and Tesla Inc. — moved in unison through much of last year, driving the brunt of the market’s gains and reigning until very recently as the S&P 500’s biggest firms.\n\nThe relentless demand for the group’s shares drew parallels to the speculative frenzy surrounding Internet stocks at the turn of the century.\n\nBut the seven have diverged in 2024 as investors soured on the outlook for several firms, signaling that the froth around the cohort may have diminished.\n\nApple has dropped this year, in part amid concern over iPhone sales in China. The firm closed at a record in December before retreating. With demand for its vehicles waning, Tesla has fared even worse, dropping below Eli Lilly & Co. in terms of market value. Google parent Alphabet has also declined this year.\n\nMore Participants\n\nCountering worries that a handful of shares were powering the bull run, the gains are showing signs of extending beyond just technology.\n\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weight Index set a closing record last week for the first time in two years. The gauge gives an equal share to each constituent, rather than weighting by market capitalization.\n\nThe share of S&P 500 stocks at all-time highs in the past month has risen, reaching the highest since early 2022, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Gillian Wolff show.\n\nEven so, less than a third of stocks are at records, “leaving plenty of room” for the bull market to gather participants, they said in a note.\n\nIn contrast, by the time the tech bubble was about to burst in early 2000, the ratio of stocks at historic levels was waning, from around 60% at one point in 1997 to 20% at the turn of the century, the strategists wrote.\n\nIPO Blues\n\nInvestors’ limited appetite for new listings is another indicator that sentiment is short of the kind of euphoria typically seen around bubbles.\n\nIn 1999, about 42% of US IPOs that raised more than $100 million saw share prices pop 50% or more through the close of the first day of trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In 2024, only one — CG Oncology Inc. — has met that criteria.\n\nThe US IPO market raised about $89 billion in 1999. While the market saw record business in 2021, it’s hit a wall since. There have been 36 IPOs in the US this year, raising $7.2 billion. In 2021, companies generated roughly $300 billion from around 1,000 deals.\n\nValuations Compared\n\nRobust profits from some of the tech behemoths have also brought down sky-high valuations. They remain relatively stretched, but they’re still well below prior peaks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks, for example, trade near their average price-to-earnings ratio since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nAnd take the largest five S&P 500 stocks today. They trade at less than half the multiples of the top stocks in early 2000 — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell — a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis shows.\n\nValuations are also contained across tech shares in areas including AI and robotics, with most of those baskets at or below their five-year average for price-to-sales multiples, according to BI.\n\n--With assistance from Elena Popina, Jessica Menton and Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "6 Dividend Stocks Make Up 78.4% of Warren Buffett's $370 Billion Portfolio, and They Are All Cheaper Than the S&amp;P 500",
        "content": "Famed investor Warren Buffett is known for finding quality businesses at a good value and holding them over time. When his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) first began investing in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, that stock traded at a steep discount to the market -- with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the range of 10 to 14.5 that year. Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today.\n\nA lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), American Express(NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), Chevron(NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500. Combined with Apple, these six companies make up 78.4% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nLet's consider why Buffett and his team like these companies, and the qualities that make them good long-term holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBrand power\n\nIn Berkshire Hathaway's most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett praised his longtime partner Charlie Munger for many things, including a key lesson he taught Buffett.\n\nCharlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: \"Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBack then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.\n\nBerkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift. Apple is the undisputed leader in smartphones, consumer electronics, and wearable devices, and offers a wide range of services, many with high margins.\n\nBank of America is the second-largest diversified bank behind JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAmerican Express is a top credit card company, along with Mastercard and Visa (which Berkshire also owns shares in).\n\nCoca-Cola is the most valuable U.S.-based beverage company.\n\nChevron is the second-biggest U.S.-based oil major, behind ExxonMobil. And Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, is one of the most valuable exploration and production companies and, assuming its deal with CrownRock L.P. goes through, will become one of the top producers in the Permian Basin -- the largest onshore oilfield in the U.S.\n\nIn sum, Berkshire's biggest stock holdings are all among the top dogs in their respective industries. Many of them have another attribute that Buffett loves -- capital return programs.\n\nRewarding shareholders\n\nOver the last five years, Apple, Bank of America, and American Express have all boosted their dividends and bought back stock at impressive rates. AAPL Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nCoke and Chevron have focused primarily on growing their dividends. Both have increased their payouts by more than 50% in the last 10 years. And Chevron has bought back a boatload of stock over the last two years. In 2023 alone, it spent a record $26 billion on dividends and buybacks.\n\nOccidental Petroleum is a bit of an outlier. In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since raised its quarterly payout several times, bringing it up to $0.22 per share, but it hasn't been exactly the type of consistent dividend payer Berkshire usually targets.\n\nOxy is also known for using debt and leveraging up its balance sheet, which it will do to pay for its pending CrownRock acquisition.\n\nIn Berkshire's 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett praised Oxy's leadership and wrote of his confidence in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Oxy stands out as a specific play on a specific theme. It amounts to 4.1% of the public equity portfolio, indicating that Berkshire is taking care to manage the position to make sure it doesn't become too large.\n\nExcellent values worth considering now\n\nYou may be wondering, if these companies all have qualities that make them suitable investments, then why would they trade at a discount to the market? Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.\n\nFinancial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.\n\nAs for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei. So its valuation has come under pressure as investors search for companies that are growing in the near term.\n\nSticking to a process\n\nBerkshire's largest stock holdings showcase its highest-conviction names. Berkshire has owned some of these stocks for decades. Others, like Apple, Chevron, and Oxy, are more recent additions to the portfolio.\n\nThe key takeaway is that Berkshire knows what it is looking for, and targets companies that fit its criteria -- not simply those that are tied to whichever hot trend is sweeping Wall Street. Berkshire invests in companies that are good values and have attractive capital return programs through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAs an individual investor, it's important to find the types of companies and sectors you like. It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance. Buffett has often said that Berkshire purposely keeps a massive cash position and is conservative with its investments, but that's because capital preservation and limiting downside risk are integral parts of his philosophy.\n\nIf you have a high risk tolerance or are multiple decades away from retirement, taking on more risk could make sense for you. But only if you are comfortable with risk and have the patience to hold onto stocks through periods of volatility.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "So far in 2024 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven’t done well at all, falling 28% and 11.5%, respectively. As a result, it appears that they aren’t so “magnificent” and their spots in the Magnificent 7 should probably be taken by other tech stocks.\n\nTherefore, in this column I will take the initiative by selecting their replacements. Among the criteria I have used in choosing replacements are the strength of firms’ businesses, the extent to which they have positive outlooks and the performance of their stocks over the last year. I’ll also add an extra nominee in case another one of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks start stumbling soon.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is benefiting tremendously from selling servers and other hardware that work in tandem with chips that produce artificial intelligence. Last quarter, for example, its top line more than doubled versus the same period a year earlier, while its bottom line climbed to $296 million from $176 million during the identical quarter in 2022.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the continued, rapid proliferation of AI and data centers’ affinity for SMCI’s products, the firm has a very bright future. Supporting this, investment bank Arguswrote that SMCI is primed for multiple years of strong top-line growth and margin expansion. The bank even compared the stock to Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their earlier days.\n\nSMCI stock had jumped an incredible 299% in the last three months and 1,028% over the last year.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) provides software that automates IT tasks, and the company launched a very successful AI-powered app in Q3 of 2023.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Bill McDermott, indicated in January that NOW had been able to charge extraordinarily high prices for its AI app. He also suggested that the firm’s AI app raises companies’ productivity levels by 40%-50%. Going forward, NOW should continue to benefit from companies’ strong demand for high-quality AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, NOW’s top line jumped 26% versus the same period a year earlier, and it expects its income from operations to soar 29% during the current quarter. Then last month, investment bank Argus hiked its price target on NOW stock to $910 from $770. The bank expects the company to benefit from continued upgrades to its AI app.\n\nThe shares have advanced 10% in the last three months and 82% over the last 12 months.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is a South American e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe firm has an impressive user base of 218 million, while its EPS more than doubled last year. According to Barron’s, EPS is expected to climb 80% in 2024.\n\nInvestment bank BTIG recommends buying MELI stock on weakness after the company reported that its gross margins fell last quarter, while its bottom line came in below analysts’ average estimate due to a tax payment.\n\nAlso impressed with the firm’s Q4 results was one of its investors, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund.

        "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has had a challenging start to 2024, with its shares down 9% year to date. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, which led to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\n\nHowever, outperforming estimates haven't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of its business. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\n\nThen, on March 4, Apple's stock slipped 3% in early trading after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service.\n\nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. A recent stock dip could be the perfect time to make a long-term investment in its business and profit from its potential over the next decade.\n\nSo here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. The brand power and financial resources to overcome current headwinds\n\nApple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year.Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.\n\nMoreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030. Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance.\n\nAs a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.\n\n2. Trading at a better value than its rivals\n\nThe tech market is booming, with the Nasdaq-100 technology sector up 11% year to date. Wall Street has grown bullish about the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and improvements in e-commerce, sending countless tech stocks soaring. While this has been beneficial for current investors, it has raised the price of entry for new ones.\n\nHowever, recent headwinds have kept Apple's stock at an attractive price point. This chart below shows that Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon. The figures indicate that Apple's shares are trading at a bargain by comparison, offering considerably more value. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing an organization's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides market cap by free cash flow.\n\nApple has faced repeated hits to its business over the past year. However, it's on a promising growth path. The company is playing the long game with its venture into VR/AR and expansion in other smartphone markets. Additionally, it has funds to invest heavily in its development.\n\nA recent stock tumble has boosted the value of its shares and made it low risk, with Apple worth buying like there's no tomorrow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nThe equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\n\nAmong the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a \"Goldilocks\" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.\n\nEd Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26:\n\n\"As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”\n\nTo benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe referred to long-term hedge funds that rarely buy and sell stocks, then found 13 stocks that they have held consistently for at least 10 years. These are the best stocks to buy and hold forever. These hedge funds include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\n13. The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nThe Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant company operating in the United States and globally. It operates through three segments – Wendy's U.S., Wendy's International, and Global Real Estate & Development. On February 15, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of March 1. It is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 31.4 million shares worth $613 million. Trian Partners has held a stake in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) consistently since 2013.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund made the following comment about The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)’s is the second-largest quick-service burger chain in the U.S. This iconic brand generates $13.3 billion of systemwide sales from 7,095 restaurant locations around the world. Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.”\n\n12. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nMoody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a global risk assessment firm with two main segments – Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. The company provides institutional risk management, credit research and structured finance solutions, credit ratings, and assessment services for debt obligations and entities. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) declared a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is payable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of February 23. On February 5, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authority.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 58 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 24.6 million shares worth $9.6 billion.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyze Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the American multinational beverage giant, is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15. The company’s revenue in Q4 2023 increased 7% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $150 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $23.5 billion.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products. The company operates through four segments – U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services, International Card Services, and Global Merchant and Network Services. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provided optimistic guidance for 2024, surpassing analyst expectations, despite the Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue falling short of estimates. American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration. The projected 2024 EPS is between $12.65 and $13.15, exceeding the consensus estimate of $12.30, with an anticipated revenue growth of 9%-11%. This guidance implies a 2024 revenue range of $66.0 billion to $67.2 billion, compared to the consensus of $66.2 billion.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 74 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $28.4 billion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):\n\n“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”\n\n9. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of human health products, including oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and vaccine products. The Animal Health segment focuses on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and health management solutions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03 and a revenue of $14.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.14 and $120 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's fourth quarter database, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was part of 98 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 85 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”\n\n8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading manufacturer and provider of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices. TSMC ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a Q4 GAAP EPADR of $1.44 and a revenue of $19.62 billion, outperforming Wall Street expectations by $0.05 and $50 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 105 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 107 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 31 million shares worth $3.2 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the fourth quarter due to investor expectations for a cyclical recovery in semiconductors heading into 2024 and significant incremental demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company with operations worldwide. It operates through Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. On January 30, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, in line with market consensus.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nJackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.5 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nHorizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an \"AI cold shower,\" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.\n\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.\n\nOn February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.\n\nSome of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT)\n\nYTD Share Price Gain as of March 8: 4.59%\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Index. The fund primarily invests in common stocks and depositary receipts, with a focus on companies involved in artificial intelligence and robotics across different sectors. As of February 1, 2024, the ETF offers an expense ratio of 0.65%, with a portfolio comprising 108 stocks. First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT) is one of the best AI ETFs to buy.\n\nSentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is one of the largest holdings of First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT). SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity provider operating globally.

(NYSE:S) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity software company that specializes in endpoint protection, cloud security, and security data analytics. Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions. The company is also leveraging its single data store and AI capabilities to cross-sell more products into its existing customer base and increase average sale prices. Between larger deal sizes and improving operating efficiencies, we believe the company can continue to expand margins at a significant rate and begin generating positive free cash flow in the next fiscal year.”\n\n11. Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO)\n\nYTD Share Price Gain as of March 8: 6.45%\n\nRobo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO) invests in global companies leading advancements in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence.

The investment firm views Nvidia as the largest beneficiary in the near-term AI landscape, emphasizing the company's significant success in this sector.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 173 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 180 funds in the last quarter.\n\nCapital stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We were fortunate to have some exposure to some of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ – Amazon, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms and Google (although in aggregate, we still hold a smaller weighting than the S&P 500).\n\nWhile we are cautious in AI infrastructure, we do think there are mispriced opportunities in areas of application software where AI can be infused to make a step change improvement. Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch. One outlier right now is Nvidia which is capturing 80% margins..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10.

Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $170.73, denoting a +1.02% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.65%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.16%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 10.26% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.50 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 1.32%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.01% decrease. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to valuation, Apple is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.82. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.34, so one might conclude that Apple is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.04. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Mini computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.56.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 183, which puts it in the bottom 28% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Epic had brazenly broke the rules in the U.S. in 2020 to trigger an antitrust lawsuit alleging Apple's App Store is a monopoly.\n\nAfter a month-long trial, a federal judge in 2021 rejected most of Epic's claims in a ruling that withstood appeals, but the bickering with Apple has continued.\n\nApple had rejected Epic's attempt to set up an account that would have allowed it to set up an alternative store for downloading iPhone apps — something that Apple has held exclusive control over for more than 15 years.\n\nBut a new set of regulations called the Digital Marketing Act, or DMA, that took effect in European Union's 27-nation bloc earlier this week cleared the way for other companies to compete against Apple's App Store — an opportunity that Epic was eager to seize upon.\n\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney had alleged Apple’s actions to stymie its efforts to open an app store in Europe were part of its efforts to retaliate against the video game maker for challenging a system that has been a huge money maker for the iPhone maker. Apple collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% for digital transactions completed within iPhone apps, an arrangement that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company while spurring complaints from Epic and other companies who rail against the fees as monopolistic price gouging.\n\nEuropean regulators signaled Apple's rejection of Epic's effort to set up an iPhones app developer account in Europe, based in Sweden, might run afoul of the DMA, raising the specter of potentially a substantial fine.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple didn't mention the regulatory approval in a brief statement saying it is now satisfied Epic will follow all its rules.\n\nSweeney applauded regulators for taking swift action to rein in Apple in a social media post that hailed the outcome as “a big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.”\n\nThe bad blood between Apple and Epic is far from over. Apple is demanding more than $73 million from Epic to cover its fees in the U.S. antitrust case over the App Store. A hearing on that demand, which Epic has described as outlandish in court papers, is scheduled later this month.",

        "title": "Apple Reverses Move to Ban ‘Fortnite’ Maker From the EU",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., facing mounting pressure from regulators in the European Union, has reversed a decision to ban Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. from offering its own iPhone app marketplace in the region.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Nasdaq 100 Falls 1.5% as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets Wrap China Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US Curbs TSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip Plant\n\nApple will restore a developer account for Epic’s Sweden division, letting the games company move ahead with plans for building its own EU app store. Apple is required to allow rival marketplaces on its platform under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which took effect this week.\n\nEpic, based in Cary, North Carolina, announced the move in a blog post Friday.\n\n“Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account,” Epic said. “This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable.”\n\nThe turnabout comes just a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker. Apple had banned the still-new Epic Games Sweden AB account earlier this month following criticism from Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney. Sweeney had taken issue with how Apple was complying with the new DMA law, calling it “hot garbage” and a “horror show.”\n\nEpic needs the developer account to launch apps in the region and go ahead with its app marketplace, which will serve as as a substitute for Apple’s App Store. Until now, the iPhone maker hasn’t permitted the downloading of apps outside its marketplace — a process known as side loading. Apple typically charges a commission of 15% to 30% on purchases within its App Store.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies,” Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement Friday. “As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”\n\nEU official Thierry Breton “noted with satisfaction” on the social media site X that Apple had backtracked on the decision.\n\nEpic’s developer account had already been banned by Apple in the US and elsewhere since 2020, when Epic bypassed Apple’s payment system to sell in-app upgrades to users. That set off a long conflict between the two companies, ultimately resulting in Apple and Epic going to court. Apple mostly prevailed, but was forced by a judge to make it easier for developers to point customers to outside payment methods for in-app purchases.\n\nAfter detailing its plans to comply with new EU regulations earlier this year, Apple moved to mend fences by granting Epic’s Sweden division a developer account in the EU.\n\nBut tension flared again. Sweeney complained about new fees that Apple was imposing as part of its DMA compliance, suggesting that it wasn’t following the spirit of the new law. Late last month, Apple App Store chief Phil Schiller complained to Epic about Sweeney’s remarks.\n\n“Your colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan, coupled with Epic’s past practice of intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees, strongly suggest that Epic Sweden does not intend to follow the rules,” Schiller said in an email to Sweeney that was later disclosed by Epic. “In plain, unqualified terms, please tell us why we should trust Epic this time,” Schiller wrote.\n\nThen, on March 2, Epic’s developer account was banned. Apple defended the move on Wednesday, saying it had the right to terminate Epic entities from its platform. It cited court determinations that the game maker had committed an “egregious breach of its contractual obligations” and Apple had the right to ban the new account “in light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior.”\n\nBut after EU regulators and iPhone app developers pushed back against what appeared to be a retaliatory move, Apple reversed course. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion for allegedly harming Spotify Technology SA and other music services in the EU — and the company likely didn’t want to incur more penalties.\n\nIt’s unclear what this means for Epic and Fortnite potentially being restored to Apple’s iOS platform outside of the EU.\n\n(Updates with Thierry Breton post in eighth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alison Williams)",

        "content": "By Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nAn AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.\n\nNvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.\n\nThe relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nNvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.\n\n\"Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,\" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\"It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.\n\nIn recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\n\nThe stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.\n\nBy comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the \"AI narrative\" stocks out there,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.\"\n\nHowever, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.\n\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.\n\n\"Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,\" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc. shares slipped Friday morning after the chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, reported disappointing revenue from its semiconductor business, even as it said that AI is helping fuel demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Huawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers China Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US Curbs How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap\n\nThe company’s semiconductor division posted revenue of $7.39 billion in the fiscal first quarter, Broadcom said Thursday, missing the $7.7 billion projected by analysts. Still, the chipmaker remains on track for $50 billion in sales during fiscal 2024, which ends in October. That’s in line with its previous forecast.\n\nThough an artificial intelligence boom is fueling demand for Broadcom equipment, the company is contending with slower sales in some segments, such as telecommunications. That’s hurting its chip business. Broadcom’s infrastructure software sales, meanwhile, beat analysts’ estimates.\n\nThe company’s stock, which had been up 26% this year, fell 3.7% Friday morning in New York. Shares of fellow chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. also slid, hurt by a weak forecast. It too has been seen as a beneficiary of AI spending.\n\nSpeaking on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said AI spending would strengthen this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company now expects the demand to account for 35% of its semiconductor revenue in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of 25%.\n\nNvidia Corp.’s stratospheric rise in the past year has sent investors looking for other companies poised to get an AI windfall. Broadcom doesn’t make Nvidia-style chips — ones used to train the large language models that power AI tools — but it does supply vital networking components and handles custom chip design work. That makes it integral to the giant data centers that are processing AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite missing estimates for chip revenue, Tan said demand was strong for its networking products from AI data centers and that large cloud computing providers are clamoring for its custom artificial intelligence chips. They are “driving growth in our semiconductor segment,” he said in a statement.\n\nBroadcom’s profit was $10.99 a share in the first quarter, excluding some items. Analysts had predicted $10.42 a share for the period, which ended Feb. 4. Total revenue rose 34% to $11.96 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $11.8 billion.\n\nSoftware demand helped make up for semiconductor sales that were more sluggish than predicted. The infrastructure software division posted revenue of $4.57 billion, beating the $4.33 billion projection. Broadcom has suspended quarterly projections while it integrates and restructures its acquisition of software maker VMware.\n\nBroadcom’s Tan has built one of the largest companies in the chip industry through a string of acquisitions. He’s also diversified the business with a push into software — an effort bolstered by the recent purchase of VMware. The integration of that deal will take a year and cost about a billion dollars, including the expense of laying off workers, Tan has said.\n\nBroadcom provides key components for Apple’s iPhone, designs custom chips for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and is the biggest supplier of networking components that direct traffic between computers in data centers. During earnings calls, Tan typically gives updates on Broadcom’s at-times contentious relationship with Apple, though he refers to it obliquely as his “North American customer” or another vague moniker.\n\nOn Thursday, Tan said Broadcom has a “very deep strategic and multiyear relationship” with the customer.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n\n(Updates shares.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\nAccording to the Migration Data Portal in 2022, the number of international migrant workers has steadily increased over the years, reaching 169 million by 2019. Of this total, 58.5% are male, while 41.5% are female. Women, in particular, are often employed in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. One of the most common reasons for immigration is the limited job opportunities in the labor market. Many people relocate to developed nations in pursuit of a better quality of life, seeking improved and higher-paying jobs, even in cases of lower education and no special skills.\n\nUnskilled Worker Immigration-- Potential for Economic Growth\n\nLow-skilled or unskilled labor/workers are typically defined as individuals employed in jobs that require little or no experience or training, often involving routine tasks. However, their role in the economy should not be underestimated. Many companies value unskilled labor as it constitutes a significant portion of their workforce. The immigration of unskilled or low-skilled workers also has far-reaching implications globally. While the increase in international migration has been associated with higher economic gains for the global GDP, ranging from 20% to 60%, unskilled immigration itself can contribute to elevated labor productivity and GDP per capita in host countries. The resulting gains can be distributed across populations in both immigrant and emigrant countries.\n\nUnskilled Immigration-- A Contentious Issue\n\nWhile immigration remains a politically contentious issue in the US, opinions on encouraging skilled and discouraging unskilled immigrants are also sharply divided. Some, particularly economists, advocate for a more lenient policy towards unskilled labor, contrasting with those who argue that such individuals may displace native workers. A recent study on the US low-skill work visa lottery supports the economists' perspective, revealing that firms forced to reduce their foreign low-skill hires by half experienced an 18% decrease in production and did not increase native hiring either.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for Unskilled Immigrants in the US\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that large organizations persist in hiring unskilled or low-skilled immigrants aspiring to obtain citizenship in developed countries like the US. These companies span various industries, including hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), fast-food giants like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), and even tech conglomerates like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nOne method is the EB-3 Unskilled Visa Program, allowing low-skilled immigrants to replace Americans who are unwilling to take entry-level jobs on a permanent full-time basis, with the desire to gain US citizenship. The Congress has allocated approximately 10,000 visas annually for such jobs. The food sector, in particular, offers multiple low-skill level jobs (entry level) continuously filled by immigrants through the EB-3 Unskilled Visa program. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), for instance, utilize this program to hire foreign workers. Currently, 72 US McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE: MCD) franchises are participating in this program, resulting in 3,200 employees obtaining their green cards.\n\nEB-3 visas have also proven successful for tech companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), 3M Company (NYSE: MMM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These companies have utilized the program to fill positions during periods of domestic labor shortages since the 1990s. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\n13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to, we referenced our article on the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World as a starting point. This preliminary list was designed to identify countries beneficial for unskilled workers in terms of income. We then utilized the Labor Market Mobility score from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020 to rank these countries in ascending order. Additionally, as a tie-breaker in case of similar rankings, we considered the foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs sourced from the OECD's Settling In 2018 Indicators of Immigrant Integration.\n\nNote: The foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs for the United States were not available in the report due to the fact that the country does not make a distinction between low-skilled and medium-skilled jobs. Information for Canada was also not available in the document.\n\nThe minimum wage rate is calculated on the basis of the exchange rate and therefore, is subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now move to our list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\n13. Israel\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nWith a robust minimum wage policy standing at $8.57 per hour, Israel stands out as a compelling option for the unskilled labor force seeking an improved quality of life, especially considering the expected further increase in the minimum wage this year. Recently, the Israeli government implemented a more lenient unskilled labor hiring policy. This change, aimed at addressing labor shortages in the country, permits industrial companies to now recruit unskilled laborfrom previously unauthorized countries, including nations like India and Sri Lanka.\n\nFor immigrants seeking better job opportunities, particularly from emerging or developing nations, Israel emerges as a promising choice. The labor market mobility score indicates a moderately favorable environment, granting immigrants immediate access to the job market, albeit under less favorable conditions than those for nationals. The employment rate for foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs in the country is 8.5%, compared to 5.7% for native-born individuals. This suggests that immigrants are more likely to secure low-skilled jobs making Israel an attractive destination for unskilled workers seeking opportunities.\n\n12. Lithuania\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nLithuania is another country offering a competitive minimum wage of $6.16 per hour to its residents. With an economy centered around finance, tourism, and luxury goods, Lithuania presents numerous job opportunities. Popular positions for foreigners without a degree include roles such as event staff, recreational attendant, hotel bellhop/porter, and more.\n\nSimilar to Israel, Lithuania offers a somewhat favorable situation for immigrants in the labor market. While most immigrants can readily access the job market, they may encounter challenges in finding opportunities for skill advancement or vocational education. Nevertheless, given the higher percentage of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs compared to native-born residents, the country presents a potential opportunity for unskilled immigrants to secure a place in the labor market.\n\n11. France\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nAs an advanced economy, France offers a globally competitive minimum wage of $12.35 per hour. Unskilled workers can find a range of job opportunities in the service sector, including restaurants, bars, and hotels. The thriving tourism industry also presents ample possibilities for individuals without specific skills or experience. Additionally, those with proficiency in English can explore employment opportunities in call centers or as nannies.\n\nFrance's labor market mobility score indicates a favorable environment for immigrants, making it relatively easy for them to find jobs, with some restrictions in more regulated job sectors. However, similar to the previously mentioned countries, accessing training and skill education may pose challenges for immigrants. The country predominantly offers low-skilled jobs to immigrants, evident in the disparity between foreign-born (18.7%) and native-born (9.2%) employment rates in low-skilled positions.\n\n10. Belgium\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 56\n\nAs a developed European country offering its residents numerous benefits, including a high minimum wage, Belgium stands out as a potential destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. With a minimum wage per hour at $12.94, Belgium provides opportunities for individuals desiring to move to the country and secure employment. Various unskilled jobs are available, ranging from positions in food service to construction labor and house cleaning, among others.\n\nThe labor market mobility for newcomers in Belgium is reasonably favorable, allowing non-EU immigrants access to public employment and training opportunities, albeit with some delays. Notably, a significant proportion of low-skilled jobs in the country (21.6%) are filled by foreign-born individuals, surpassing the native-born employment rate of 8.7%. Consequently, Belgium emerges as a viable option for unskilled immigrants seeking job opportunities and a place to settle down.\n\n9. New Zealand\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nEffective from April 1, 2024, the minimum wage in New Zealand is expected to be set at $14.12 per hour. While the country, like many others, is streamlining rules to attract skilled labor, there are ample opportunities for unskilled workers as well. Various industries, including hospitality, manufacturing, retail, supermarkets, and construction, actively employ a significant number of unskilled workers. Immigrants entering the country on job visas in these sectors can not only enjoy competitive salaries in this developed nation but also access many other associated benefits.\n\nWhile new immigrants in New Zealand may experience some delays in complete labor market integration, the labor market mobility score indicates that they can still access the market and benefit from targeted support. Notably, 9.2% of foreign-born residents in New Zealand are employed in low-skilled jobs, showcasing opportunities for newcomers to participate in the workforce.\n\n8. Japan\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nJapan, as a developed nation with a robust economy and a relatively high minimum wage set at $7.46 per hour since October 1, 2023, has undergone significant changes in its immigration policies. In late 2018, the country revised its immigration laws to attract both low-skilled and high-skilled workers to address labor shortages in specific sectors. From April 2019, this initiative aimed to encourage the immigration of 350,000 new individuals—comprising both types of workers—over a consecutive five-year period. Additionally, the country's growth in the agriculture and construction sectors has led to increased employment opportunities for low/unskilled workers.\n\nJapanese immigrant integration policies prioritize equal treatment for permanent residents alongside other citizens. Temporary workers are also granted the opportunity to secure basic subordinate-level jobs. The foreign-born rate of employment in low-skilled jobs is notably higher at 12.5%, compared to the native-born rate of 9%, indicating increased opportunities for unskilled workers to find employment in low-skilled roles within the country.\n\n7. Netherlands\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nAs one of the strongest economies in Europe, the Netherlands emerges as a promising destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. The country offers a wealth of diverse job opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, retail, and food service. Notably, the Netherlands provides a highly competitive minimum wage of $14.46 per hour.\n\nThe Netherlands also secures a place in the slightly favorable category of the MIPEX integration index, indicating the ease with which new non-EU migrants can find employment in both public and private sectors. Long-term migrants and families staying in the country also enjoy equal access to education, training, and study grants. Additionally, the proportion of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs surpasses that of the native-born population (15.2% compared to 8.2%), underscoring increased opportunities for unskilled individuals to secure these positions.\n\n6. South Korea\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nSouth Korea stands among the nations with a high minimum wage, currently set at $7.40 per hour as of January 1, 2024. The Korean government actively promotes the influx of low-skilled foreign workers into the country, particularly in sectors such as hospitality, mining, and forestry. The goal is to attract and integrate 165,000 new immigrants into these industries.\n\nSouth Korea's labor market mobility score suggests a generally favorable attitude toward immigrants, with long-term residents enjoying easy access to self-employment, public jobs, and general and targeted support. However, temporary workers may encounter some obstacles. Notably, there is a significant difference between the foreign-born and native-born populations in low-skilled level jobs. A substantial 32% of foreign-born individuals were found to be employed in unskilled worker positions, compared to only 9.9% of the native-born population holding such jobs.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Best Places to Retire If You Have No Savings 30 Countries with the Highest GDP in 2023 20 Countries with Highest Income Tax Rates in Europe\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nStocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a \"Goldilocks\" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.\n\nThe 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February \"60 Minutes\" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an \"overbought\" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains \"overbought\" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of \"overbought\" for three consecutive months or more.\n\nStory continues\n\nBofA analysts commented:\n\n\"A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.\"\n\nSome of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's holdings that seeks to track the investment results of S&P Total Market Index, which is composed of U.S. equities.

The company generates over half of its revenue in the U.S. from its top-selling drugs Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz. The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”\n\n10. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”\n\n8.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

        "content": "DexCom Inc. DXCM recently introduced a new direct-to-Apple-Watch feature for its G7 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) users.\n\nWith the new feature, G7 is likely to be the first CGM device that can link to Apple Watch directly, negating the requirement for an iPhone to be carried around. By the end of second-quarter 2024, Dexcom intends a gradual launch for all iOS users worldwide.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nFor the past six months, DXCM’s shares have gained 17.3% compared with the industry’s rise of 9.5%. The S&P 500 increased 14.2% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDexcom G7 CGM System\n\nSince the international conference of Advanced Technologies and Treatments of Diabetes 2023, Dexcom has expanded access to its ground-breaking real-time CGM technology by introducing its best-in-class G7 sensor into 16 new markets. Patients with diabetes of any kind, including gestational, who are two years of age and older can use Dexcom G7. This wearable glucose meter can be worn day or night on the back of the upper arm for up to 10 days, and it requires replacement.\n\nThe Dexcom G7 CGM System is designed to be user-friendly, robust, and efficient. CGM uses a wearable sensor to continuously monitor your blood sugar levels. Without the inconvenience of fingersticks or scanning, Dexcom CGM Systems transmit your blood glucose readings in real time to a handheld receiver or smart device.\n\nPatients can control their glucose and accomplish outcomes like a lower A1C and more time in range by making better decisions about what to eat, how much to exercise, and how to take their medications when they have simpler access to real-time CGM data.\n\nThe Dexcom G7 CGM sensor needs only 30 minutes to warm up, and there is a 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a seamless transition between sessions. The alert settings on the system have also been improved.\n\nThe new direct-to-Apple-Watch feature for G7 will boost the sensor’s accessibility, driving better acceptance and reliability among its patient population. Moreover, it will allow to target a patient population using smartwatches, including Apple watches, for managing their health.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Prospects\n\nPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital diabetes management market was estimated to be $18.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $35.8 billion by 2028 at a growth rate of 13.6%.\n\nThe market is being driven by escalating diabetes care solutions and technological developments that have made it possible to introduce highly adaptable solutions. Other significant drivers include the increasing popularity of the use of connected devices and apps as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions.\n\nGiven the market potential, the improvement and innovation of new features for its CGM system are likely to provide a significant boost to Dexcom’s business.\n\nNotable Developments\n\nDexcom recently announced the FDA clearance of its Stelo glucose biosensor, which is available over-the-counter to consumers without a prescription. Stelo's approval for non-prescription use would further facilitate this population's access to cutting-edge CGM technology.\n\nIn December 2023, Dexcom announced the Dexcom G7 CGM System connectivity with the t: slim X2 insulin pump by Tandem Diabetes Care in the United States, marking the first AID integration with the Dexcom G7 CGM.\n\nDexcom also unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Athenry Co. Galway. With the ability to produce millions of Dexcom rtCGM sensors annually, the new plant is likely to contribute to the betterment of diabetes patients throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nDexCom, Inc.

        "title": "Apple Has Spent $175 Billion on R&amp;D Since the Start of 2013 -- but It's the $651 Billion Spent on Something Else That's the Real Jaw-Dropper",
        "content": "Although it's been surpassed by Microsoft as the largest publicly traded company by market cap, few tech giants have delivered for investors quite like Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nDespite its ebbs and flows, shares of Apple have scurried higher by 790% over the trailing-10-year period and have skyrocketed by almost 132,000% since its initial public offering in December 1980. Investors who simply purchased shares of Apple and did nothing else have historically done pretty well.\n\nWhile there's a laundry list of catalysts that have lifted Apple's valuation over time, the company's success ultimately boils down to two factors: innovation and a surprising \"investment\" that's been highly beneficial to its shareholders. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple isn't afraid to spend aggressively on innovation\n\nTo become one of the largest publicly traded companies, a business will generally have to grow at a sustained high rate and remain on the cutting edge of the innovation curve within its respective sector or industry. Peering back through more than 11 years of annual and quarterly filings, it's clear that Apple and its management team, led by CEO Tim Cook, aren't afraid to invest for the future.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses have grown every year since the start of 2013 and total just over $175 billion through the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (Dec. 30, 2023):\n\n2013: $4.475 billion in R&D expenses 2014: $6.041 billion 2015: $8.067 billion 2016: $10.045 billion 2017: $11.581 billion 2018: $14.236 billion 2019: $16.217 billion 2020: $18.752 billion 2021: $21.914 billion 2022: $26.251 billion 2023: $29.915 billion Q1 2024: $7.696 billion\n\nSome of these growing R&D expenses are undoubtedly directed at keeping the company in the lead in the smartphone arena. Since Apple integrated 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's seen its domestic market share in smartphones surge above 50%. Consumers tend to be exceptionally loyal to Apple's physical products, which include iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, among other accessories.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple's R&D spending goes beyond the physical products that brought the company fame. For years, Tim Cook has been overseeing the evolution of Apple's operations. Although it's still producing and improving its popular physical products, Apple is aiming to be a platforms company that's ultimately driven by subscriptions.\n\nThe advantage of the company's services focus is threefold:\n\nSubscriptions typically generate higher margins than physical products. It'll further enhance the loyalty of Apple's customer base by keeping consumers within its ecosystem of physical products and services. The steady revenue generated by Apple's Services segment will smooth out the sales fluctuations traditionally observed during iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nWhat's even more eye-popping than the $175.19 billion Apple has spent on R&D since the beginning of 2013 is its \"investment\" that's nearly quadrupled R&D in size over the same period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's $651 billion \"investment\" has played a big role in making shareholders richer\n\nWith Apple generating boatloads of operating cash flow, it has the ability to take chances that most companies can't match. It can also reward shareholders in a way that no other business can.\n\nOn a nominal-dollar basis, Apple's dividend is one of the largest in the world. Last year, the company doled out just a hair over $15 billion to its shareholders as a dividend. But its share repurchase program is many multiples larger.\n\nSince initiating a share buyback program in 2013, Apple has overseen the repurchase of $650.88 billion worth of its common stock, which is tops among publicly traded companies:\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion Q1 2024: $20.139 billion\n\nThe beauty of share buybacks is twofold. To start with, a declining share count incrementally increases the ownership stakes of existing investors. AAPL Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nBut the second and arguably more important catalyst is that stock repurchases can increase a company's earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income will see their EPS grow over time as their outstanding share count declines. This can make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nAs an example, Apple's net income declined from $99.8 billion in fiscal 2022 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September) to roughly $97 billion in fiscal 2023. But thanks to Apple spending $77.55 billion on buybacks last year, which retired more than 513 million shares, the company's adjusted EPS actually increased by $0.02 to $6.13 per share in 2023, despite the $2.8 billion drop in net income.\n\nSince the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased nearly 11 billion shares of common stock, or roughly 41% of its outstanding shares.\n\nWhile buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's share price over the past 11 years and change, Wall Street and investors are likely eager to see one of the world's largest tech companies reignite its growth engine after it stalled out in 2023. But as long as Apple continues to aggressively put its money to work via buybacks, it's reasonable to expect modest EPS expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "78% of Warren Buffett's $369 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 6 Stocks",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Warren Buffett has put on a master class in how to beat Wall Street. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a jaw-dropping aggregate return of 4,961,342%, as of the closing bell on March 1.\n\nExtensive books have been written discussing the investing philosophies that have allowed the Oracle of Omaha to trounce Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. These traits include buying stakes in brand-name businesses with strong management teams, as well as investing with a long-term mindset. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut if there's one catalyst to Buffett's undeniable investing success that doesn't get nearly enough credit, it's his penchant for portfolio concentration. Both he and the recently departed Charlie Munger, who Buffett described as the \"Architect of Berkshire Hathaway\" in his annual letter to shareholders, have firmly believed that their top investment ideas deserve added weighting. If these top holdings perform well, it likely means Berkshire Hathaway stock can head even higher.\n\nBased on closing values from March 1, 78% -- $290 billion -- of the $369 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in only six stocks.\n\n1. Apple: $162,692,909,600 (44% of invested assets)\n\nAny question investors may have had about the Oracle of Omaha's desire to concentrate his company's portfolio is answered by looking at Berkshire's mammoth stake in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Even after Buffett and his team reduced their company's stake in Apple by roughly 1% during the December-ended quarter, it still accounts for 44% of invested assets.\n\nApple's innovation has driven the outperformance of its stock for years. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's pretty consistently held a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut this innovation extends well beyond its well-known physical products. For years, CEO Tim Cook has been overseeing a transformation that's emphasized subscription services. To be clear, Apple isn't forgetting about the physical products, like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, that brought it fame. Rather, it's evolving into a platforms company that'll further enhance customer loyalty and keep these customers within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is also, undeniably, a fan of Apple's world-leading capital-return program. Since introducing a share repurchase program in 2013, Apple has bought back more than $600 billion worth of its common stock.\n\n2. Bank of America: $35,478,466,406 (9.6% of invested assets)\n\nAnother company that Warren Buffett and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, clearly love is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Berkshire owns more than 13% of the outstanding shares of BofA, which equates to almost $35.5 billion in market value.\n\nThe lure of financial stocks for the Oracle of Omaha has always been the cyclical nature of the industry. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, economic downturns pass quickly. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, two periods of growth over the same span stuck around for at least a decade. Companies like Bank of America should be able to successfully grow their loan portfolios over time as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nInterestingly enough, Bank of America also holds an advantage in the current economic climate as the most interest-sensitive of all U.S. money-center banks. In other words, no bank will see its net-interest income shift more with changes to interest rates. The Fed's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to BofA's bottom line each quarter.\n\nTo boot, BofA typically returns in excess of $20 billion to shareholders each year via dividends and buybacks when the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders.\n\n3. American Express: $33,302,806,362 (9% of invested assets)\n\nEven though a tech stock accounts for the leading stake in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, there's not a sector Buffett enjoys putting his company's cash to work in more than financials. It's why American Express (NYSE: AXP) is the second financial stock in Berkshire's top-three holdings.\n\nThe not-so-subtle secret to AmEx's continued success is its willingness to play on both sides of the transaction aisle. In the U.S., which is the top market for consumption globally, it's the clear No. 3 in credit card network purchase volume.\n\nBut in addition to facilitating transactions and collecting a fee from merchants, American Express is also acting as a lender to consumers and businesses in which it earns annual fees and interest income. During extended periods of economic growth, AmEx's ability to double-dip allows it to thrive.\n\nThe other factor that makes American Express a top-notch investment is its success in luring well-to-do consumers. People with higher incomes are less likely than the average earner to alter their spending habits during minor periods of economic disruption. On paper, this should help AmEx navigate challenging economic climates better than most lending institutions. Image source: Coca-Cola.\n\n4. Coca-Cola: $23,812,000,000 (6.4% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth-largest holding is the longest-tenured stock in Buffett's portfolio, beverage company Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Shares of Coca-Cola have been held since 1988.\n\nWhat's more, Berkshire Hathaway is netting a roughly 60% annual yield on its Coke shares thanks to a minuscule cost basis of $3.2475 per share. Coca-Cola recently increased its base annual payout for a 62nd consecutive year.\n\nA big reason the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team view Coca-Cola as a core holding is its consistency. According to Kantar's annual Brand Footprint report, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand from retail shelves for 10 years running (as of 2022). Since it's selling consumer staples that'll be purchased in any economic climate, Coca-Cola's cash flow and profits tend to be highly predictable.\n\nCoca-Cola also enjoys virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has existing operations in every other country. This allows it to generate that aforementioned predictable cash flow in developed markets, while moving the organic growth needle via emerging markets.\n\n5. Chevron: $19,268,321,146 (5.2% of invested assets)\n\nThroughout much of this century, energy stocks have played little or no role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Over the past two years and change, we've witnessed a sizable shift in sentiment from Berkshire's brightest minds. Integrated oil and gas giant Chevron(NYSE: CVX) currently holds the No. 5 spot in the $369 billion portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees.\n\nHaving more than $19 billion invested in a leading oil and gas stock is a pretty clear indication that Buffett and his team believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms. Supporting this thesis is multiple years of capital underinvestment by major energy companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This underinvestment has led to energy commodity supply constraints that should provide a healthy lift to the spot price of crude oil and push profits for drillers higher.\n\nThe \"integrated\" aspect of Chevron's operating model is also important. Although drilling generates its juiciest margins, Chevron owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. If the spot price of crude oil declines, the company's midstream and downstream assets act as a hedge that stabilizes its cash flow.\n\nThe icing on the cake here is that Chevron doles out a 4% yield and has raised its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n6. Occidental Petroleum: $15,218,392,334 (4.1% of invested assets)\n\nWarren Buffett's $369 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway only has two energy stocks, but they occupy the fifth and sixth spots in terms of portfolio concentration. The 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) held by Berkshire, worth $15.2 billion on March 1, have all been added since the start of 2022.\n\nWhile the macro catalysts described with Chevron align similarly with integrated oil and gas operator Occidental, there are some very defined differences between these two companies.\n\nFor example, Occidental brings in the lion's share of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment. This means its operating cash flow is highly sensitive to shifts in the spot price of crude oil. While it'll benefit more than other integrated operators (including Chevron) if oil prices increase, the reciprocal is also true -- Occidental will struggle mightily if the spot price for crude oil significantly declines.\n\nThe other big difference between Chevron and Occidental can be seen on their balance sheets. Whereas Chevron has what's arguably the best balance sheet among oil majors with a low debt-to-equity ratio, Occidental is still lugging around $18.5 billion in net debt. Unlike Chevron, Occidental needs the spot price of crude oil to remain high to continue reducing its outstanding debt.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The largest weekly outflow on record for technology stock funds hasn’t dimmed the broader euphoria that is driving US equities to “ferocious” gains, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Huawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers China Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US Curbs How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap\n\nAbout $4.4 billion was pulled from tech funds in the week through March 6, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. The outflows come as Apple Inc. shares entered a technical correction this month, amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.\n\nHartnett — who has taken a more neutral tone on stocks this year after remaining bearish in 2023 — said equity markets are showing “abnormal gains” in “abnormal times” after a 25% rally in the S&P 500 since end-October. That’s left positioning “stretched and extended” ahead of expectations for an eventual interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, he wrote in a note.\n\nUS stocks have scaled record highs this year, driven by the frenzy around artificial intelligence and optimism about a pivot in the Fed’s monetary policy. A narrow group of tech behemoths — the so-called Magnificent Seven — have driven a majority of the gains, but there’s been a growing dispersion between the stocks in the past few weeks.\n\nWhile Nvidia Corp. has scaled record highs, Apple and Tesla Inc. have slumped 12% and 28%, respectively, this year.\n\nStill, Hartnett reiterated that technology stocks could have more room to rally, even though semiconductors are trading at their highest level on record relative to the S&P 500.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists also don’t see a concentration risk in US stocks, as they say the top stocks trade at much lower valuations than the largest stocks did at the peak of the tech bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\n“While investors usually think of elevated concentration as a sign of downside risk, the S&P 500 rallied more often than it declined” in the 12 months after past episodes of peak concentration, Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider wrote in a note.\n\nFor BofA’s Hartnett, the only factor that could “melt this determination” in markets is a drop in US payrolls. Latest data, due Friday, are expected to show the US economy added 200,000 new jobs last month.\n\nOther highlights from the note, citing EPFR Global data:\n\nGlobal stock funds had inflows of $6.9 billion in the week through March 6, while $17.3 billion was added to bond funds US stock funds registered outflows of $100 million European funds suffered a tenth straight week of redemptions at $1.2 billion\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

That’s despite signs that Apple Inc., which accounted for 25% of its business last year, is struggling to sustain momentum for the iPhone particularly in China.\n\nTSMC, the main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp., is riding a wave of activity in artificial intelligence that accelerated after OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT. The world’s most advanced chipmaker is considered one of the major beneficiaries of a rise in development of large language models that require high-end chips. This week, JPMorgan became the latest brokerage to raise its price target on the Taiwanese company, citing not just AI but potentially business from Intel Corp. as well in coming years.\n\nTSMC is “the enabler for almost all AI processing at the data center and the edge,” analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote.\n\nRead More: Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge\n\nIn January, executives said they expect a return to solid growth this quarter and gave themselves room to raise capital spending in 2024, suggesting TSMC anticipates a recovery in smartphone and computing demand.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 15 best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024. If you want to sip our discussion about Apple's patent infringement, smartwatch market, and smartwatch ownership globally, go to the 7 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.\n\nA patent infringement case is pushing Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) to stop selling two of the most recent Apple Watch models, Series 9 and Ultra 2. The disputed component in these watches is the blood oxygen technology. The International Trade Center (ITC) ruled on October 2023 that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has infringed patents for pulse oximetry tech by Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a medical device manufacturer. The tech giant is trying to come up with a solution, but it seems like it will be a while before that happens. Given this ban, it is worth looking at some of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.\n\nThe global smartwatch market is growing at a fast rate. It was valued at $33.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $90.4 billion by 2032, growing at a compounding annual growth rate of 10.5% during this period. The convenience of glancing at the wrist to stay informed about messages, calls, and important updates without picking up the phone is one of the biggest reasons for its market growth.\n\nAnother pivotal factor propelling the smartwatch market is health and fitness. These watches provide a holistic approach to health management. They offer features such as heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout guidance. However, smartwatches do not come cheap, and their cost is one of the greatest hindrances in the growth of the global market.\n\nThere are many ways to segment the global smartwatch market, but one of the most common segregation is based on screen type. Currently, these watches are segmented into LCD and OLED according to the screen type, with OLED having a 91% share of the market.OLED has many advantages, which is why it is contributing to the overall growth of the market. Compared to LCD, it offers more vibrant colors and is more energy efficient.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother way to segment smartwatches is based on the application. These segments include running, notification checking, swimming, and cycling. The running segment takes the lion's share of 36%. Brand-wise, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is the largest player in the market with a 20% market share. Other major players include Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) and Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN).\n\nFossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) was founded in 1984 and went public in 1990. The company has been at the forefront of smartwatch technology, recently launching exclusive smartwatch capabilities like next-gen touchscreen technology and advancements in hybrid smartwatches. However, it is worth noting that Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) recently announced quitting the smartwatches market.\n\nGramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) is a prominent company known for its innovative products and solutions. The company is known for its continuous innovation in the smartwatch industry. Some of the most popular smartwatches by Gramin Ltd (NYSE:GRMN) include the Gramin Venu 2, which ranks quite high on our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024.\n\nCurrently, more than 200 million people use smartwatch globally. Like smartphone ownership in the US, men have a slight advantage as 23% of them use a smartwatch compared to 21.8% of women. It is worth noting here that ownership is the highest among internet users aged 25 to 34. Interestingly, within this age group, women are more likely to own a smartwatch. Of all internet-using people aged 25 to 34, 27.2% of women use a smartwatch as opposed to 26.9% of men.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 15 best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024.  15 Best Apple Watch Alternatives in 2024\n\nA marathon runner wearing a company branded smartwatch, monitoring his performance in real-time.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 15 best Apple watch alternatives in 2024, we consulted 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the watch appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of watches in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 15/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the watch ranks on our list.\n\nThe ranking factor is designed in a way that it is always positive but less than 1. So, if the Insider Monkey score of watch A is 3.75, 3 is its frequency, whereas 0.75 is its ranking factor. For comparison, if watch B had an Insider Monkey Score of 4.40, its frequency is 4, but overall it ranked lower than watch A on our sources. However, since we prioritize frequency, watch B ranks higher on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15 - Amazfit T Rex 2\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 1.038\n\nAmazfit T Rex 2 is one of the best Apple Watch alternatives in 2024.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Congress moved a step closer to forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell the popular video-sharing platform over national security concerns, with a committee advancing legislation Thursday that would block app stores and internet service providers from offering it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap Biden to Direct Military to Build Gaza Port to Deliver Aid New York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight Crime\n\nTikTok mounted a last-minute effort to counter the bill, which was unveiled Tuesday, by urging its users to call congressional offices to protest the bill via a message that greeted them when they opened the app. Users flooded members offices with calls, drawing the ire of House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher.\n\nLawmakers said “their phones were ringing off the hook last night,” Gallagher told journalists outside the Capitol on Thursday. “The intimidation tactics, the disinformation has to stop,” he said later in a video message.\n\nIn the end the campaign was unsuccessful, at least in preventing lawmakers from taking the first step toward enacting the legislation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 50-0 Thursday to approve the bill and advance it toward the House floor.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have long expressed national security concerns over TikTok’s ties to its owner ByteDance Ltd., citing risks of the Chinese government collecting personal data from American users and spreading propaganda on the app. The platform has been under a national security review since the Trump administration. The Biden administration has signaled cautious support for the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying Wednesday that “we would want to see this bill get done.”\n\nStory continues\n\nPrevious legislative attempts to restrict the app nationwide have failed, and this one would still have to clear legislative hurdles in the House and Senate. But lawmakers say this latest effort has been months in the making, fueled partly by renewed security concerns that China is surveilling Americans. The legislation would give ByteDance six months to divest from TikTok.\n\nRead More: TikTok Can Keep ‘Bad Lip-Sync,’ Lawmakers Seeking Sale Say\n\nTikTok has consistently denied that it has or will share any US user data with Beijing and has tried to assuage US concerns by spending more than $1.5 billion to isolate its US operations and agreeing to oversight from American partner Oracle Corp.

        "content": "One tool that bargain hunters can utilize to identify beaten up stocks to buy after significant declines is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI signals when a stock’s downward momentum may be exhausted, indicating that a correction could provide upside potential.\n\nTypically, an RSI reading below 30 is viewed as an ‘oversold’ level, suggesting the asset may be due to a rebound. However, the RSI alone is insufficient to conclude a buying opportunity exists in beaten up stocks to buy. A thorough review of the company’s financial position is prudent to evaluate whether value currently exists.\n\nThe following three stocks have seen their share prices decline substantially recently. Although their RSIs indicate oversold conditions, their underlying business fundamentals still appear sound. This provides a potential for short-term gains for investors looking for certain beaten up stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlbertsons (ACI) ACI stock: the Albertsons logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nAlbertsons (NYSE:ACI) has been heavily featured in the news lately, largely due to Kroger’s proposed merger announced in October 2022. However, the deal has faced significant obstacles. Recently, the FTC filed a lawsuit that has placed the merger’s fate in the hands of the judiciary. This has unsettled investors, sending the ACI lower to its 14-day RSI of 11.6.\n\nWhile a successful consummation of the Kroger deal could deliver substantial upside, Albertsons maintains robust financials even without the merger. Its latest Q3 earnings demonstrated this resiliency, with diluted EPS jumping over 300%. Due to its undervaluation and strong fundamentals, ACI could be considered one of the beaten up stocks to buy.\n\nAlbertsons trades at a relatively low valuation, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.7x – less than half the broader U.S. grocery sector at 17.2x. This leaves the stock undervalued, representing one of the more compelling beaten up stocks to buy for patient investors.​\n\nStory continues\n\nMedifast (MED) Light blue pills on white background.

Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) has been facing some headwinds lately. The weight loss and supplement company suffered from consumers’ ability to hire weight loss coaches and the arrival of Ozempic and other drugs. The most recent earnings missed expectations, weighing heavily on the price of this beaten up stock to buy. Management remains hopeful of a turnaround following a deal with LifeMD (NASDAQ:LFMD) to expand sales channels.\n\nThe company’s shares dropped significantly, with its RSI reaching an oversold level of just 5.9. What’s interesting for potential investors is that Medifast trades at a P/E ratio of only 4.2x despite the earnings miss. The forward dividend yield stands at 17.4%, and the company increased its cash holdings. This indicates that the dividend is well covered and provides attractive value for investors in this beaten-up stock.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven major technology firms are not immune to market volatility, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders are now well aware. The iPhone maker experienced a difficult beginning in 2024 as sales in China and across the EU fell short of expectations. Apple’s stock price has dropped 12% this year, placing the company – a long-term favorite of Warren Buffett – in its most oversold position in six years at an RSI of just 22.1.\n\nWhile a business as large and well-established as Apple may not immediately spring to mind when considering beaten up stocks to buy, technical analysts note the current weakness presents investors with a potential buying opportunity to secure a high-quality business at a temporarily discounted valuation. Only time will tell if 2024 brings an uptick in fortunes for the technology titan. However, long-term backers will hope current headwinds prove a mere blip rather than the start of a longer-term downtrend.​\n\nApple’s P/E ratio trades at just 26.3x, below the S&P 500‘s 27.7x. Investors may see the beaten up stock to buy as a good quality choice that will shine through in the longer run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Do These 2 Stocks Belong in the Magnificent 7?",
        "content": "The so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ group, consisting of Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, and Amazon AMZN, has been a dominant story within the market for some time, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains.\n\nThey’ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.\n\nHowever, two of the members in particular, Apple AAPL and Tesla TSLA, have come under scrutiny amid considerable underperformance relative to the rest of the group. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven their underperformance, should they be kicked out of the elite club? Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.\n\nApple\n\nApple hasn’t seen any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, with analysts lowering their expectations across multiple timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning headline figures in its latest release, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS totaled $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. In addition, Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and jumped 11.3% from the same period last year.\n\nApple’s Services portfolio has been an excellent source of growth, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone. Nonetheless, shares fell following the report, attributed to demand worries in China. Sales in the region reached $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.\n\nSlowing growth has undoubtedly been reflected by the recent share performance, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 7% earnings growth on a marginal 0.6% sales increase. Still, shares are currently trading at their most oversold levels in years, undoubtedly worth keeping an eye on.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven the company’s remarkable cash-generating abilities, established customer base, and news surrounding AI, the company’s long-term view remains bright. If positive earnings estimate revisions begin creeping in, shares will likely follow and move higher.\n\nTesla\n\nOnce hailed as the poster child for growth stocks, Tesla’s share performance over the last year has left many investors with a sour taste. Lower margins, hybrid momentum, and competition in China have all been thorns in the side of the company.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe weak share performance has coincided with bearishness among analysts, with the company’s earnings outlook moving lower across all timeframes. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNonetheless, the company continues to be the dominant EV player, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle in the world throughout 2023. And operations remain sound – Tesla posted $4.4 billion of free cash flow throughout its FY23 and saw its cost of goods sold per vehicle decline sequentially throughout its Q4.\n\nThe company’s growth is forecasted to stall slightly in its current year (FY24), with consensus estimates alluding to 1.3% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. Growth resumes in a big way for FY25, as expectations presently suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 20% higher revenues.\n\nThe stock remains a prime consideration for those bullish on the long-term EV picture, but analysts’ recent revisions reflect a cloudy near-term outlook.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ has been on the minds of all investors, whose performance as a group has been remarkable.\n\nStill, two members of the club – Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL – are beginning to be shunned by the market, with the share performance of each over the last year lagging considerably.\n\nBoth Tesla and Apple remain great long-term stocks, underpinned by fundamentals and operational execution. But recent performance has been anything but magnificent, especially when compared to the other members.\n\nIt’s worth noting that many of the other Mag 7 members, including Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT, currently boast a much stronger earnings outlook. All four of these members presently sport a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), reflecting upward-trending earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe remaining member, Alphabet GOOGL, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen positive revisions across multiple timeframes as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Standout Tech Stocks to Buy Down at Least 15%",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.\n\nThe bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.\n\nThe tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.\n\nAdobe (ADBE)\n\nAdobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.\n\nADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion.\n\nADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s (NVDA) 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.\n\nFears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.\n\nApple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.\n\nApple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ)\n\nBlock, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.\n\nBlock appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlock remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.\n\nBlock’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average.\n\nThe stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Welcome to the Digital Markets Act. Here’s what you need to know about the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law",
        "content": "Europe’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) finally started hitting Big Tech with tough antitrust obligations today. And what better way to understand its impact than to look at how tech firms have moved to comply—and to take advantage of new opportunities?\n\nBut first, here’s what happens if these so-called gatekeepers—which so far include Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok parent ByteDance—don’t comply. They can get hit with fines of up to 10% of global annual revenue. If they keep breaking the rules, those fines can rise to 20%, and the European Commission can even break businesses up or block them from buying other companies relating to whatever naughtiness is concerned.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in light of how weak enforcement by underfunded national regulators undermined the bite of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, which deals with privacy, the Commission has decided to enforce the DMA itself. The same goes for its sister law, the Digital Services Act, which mostly deals with content-moderation issues. It remains to be seen whether the Commission has the resources to do this effectively for either law, but that’s the plan.\n\nGot that? Cool. Let’s proceed with the changes themselves—and remember, these are Europe-only.\n\nMoving easily to rival services. Many companies have been letting users download their data for years now, but now they’re going beyond that. For example, Google and TikTok-owner ByteDance have launched data portability APIs so users can give other developers permission to directly import their data from the gatekeepers' services—handy for switching service providers, but also potentially for backing up their data.\n\nFreedom from default choices. Remember when Microsoft was once forced to tell Windows users that they had browser options beyond Internet Explorer, like Google’s Chrome? Now Chrome will tell its users that they have other search engine options. And Google will also give Android users a choice of browsers and search engines when they set up their device.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore control over data privacy. Continuing the inexorable bleeding together of data-protection and competition law, people now get to decide if one of these Big Tech conglomerates can keep linking together the data from accounts users have with its various services—something that has big implications for user profiling and ad targeting. So Meta now lets people decouple Facebook and Instagram accounts and Google does the same for YouTube, Search, and its many other services.\n\nChoice of in-app payment services. Google and Apple now let app developers deploy third-party payment mechanisms that aren’t Google Pay and Apple Pay. Google mostly did this in 2022 already, though it’s only now fully expanded the program to game developers. Apple left everything until the last minute. But hey, third-party developers can actually access the iPhone’s NFC tap-to-pay chip now!\n\nInteroperability of services. Gatekeepers don’t have to make their services interoperable with just anyone—nobody wants security to go out the window—but they do need to allow it in principle. So for example, users of Meta’s WhatsApp will soon be able to talk to people on other messaging platforms. (Meta is trying to avoid the same obligation for its Messenger service.)\n\nBusiness data transparency. Business customers of these platforms can now demand easier access to the data they generate. This looks set to have a real impact in the advertising space, as both Google and Amazon are now promising to give advertisers and publishers more data.\n\nNo more anti-steering. Well hello there, Apple. Days after the company was fined $2 billion for refusing to let Spotify and other streaming services inform their iOS users about cheaper off-platform subscription deals, the new rules demand more clearly that gatekeepers let business users “promote offers and conclude contracts with customers outside the gatekeeper's platform.” So that’s definitely now a thing, although Google is trying the interesting tactic of claiming fat fees for these “external offers,” as it calls them. I imagine developers will complain to the Commission about that. But speaking of Apple…\n\nThird-party app stores. Google already allowed third-party app stores on Android, and as of now, Apple must do the same on iOS. The first third party, whose German developers have promised a launch as soon as the DMA comes into force (it isn’t live yet), is Mobivention, which focuses on the enterprise market. MacPaw’s Setapp should follow in April.\n\nHowever, Apple celebrated the advent of the DMA by denying arch-nemesis Epic Games’ attempt to launch a European iOS app store and bring Fortnite back to European iPhones. I don’t have space to explain why here—but you can find my comprehensive explainer here. Tl;dr: Apple’s DMA-compliance hissy fit over the past couple months has somehow become even more outrageous, and it's unlikely to pay off for the company. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just released a video celebrating the advent of the DMA, and it pointedly referred to Fortnite returning to iOS. I checked with her staff, and she definitely recorded it after Apple's latest tantrum.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "‘A serious violation’: Why Apple just killed off Epic’s EU app store, and why the Fortnite maker will probably prevail",
        "content": "To mark the moment the European Union’s new Big Tech antitrust law comes into force, Tim Cook’s Apple has decided to test its limits with an extraordinary escalation of its long-running feud with Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduces many new obligations for so-called “gatekeeper” services that link businesses and consumers, and the iPhone operating system iOS and its App Store have both been classified as such.\n\nSo, as of Thursday, Apple is obliged to allow third-party app stores on iPhones—a shift that will allow developers to distribute apps without having to give Apple a fat cut of transactions conducted within them.\n\nEpic was planning to become one of the first big players to launch an iOS app store, but on Wednesday the Fortnite maker revealed that Apple had blocked the move by terminating the developer account that Epic’s Swedish affiliate had set up to launch the store, and that provides Epic games on Apple's own App Store.\n\n“This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices,” Epic wrote in a blog post. “In terminating Epic’s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.”\n\nThe revelation quickly drew a response from the European Commission, which will be directly enforcing the DMA, and which said it had asked Apple for “further explanations” under the new law.\n\nLong-running feud\n\nTo understand what just happened, one needs to rewind to the start of the decade when Epic and Apple began their feud over the issue of in-app payments, which have traditionally earned Apple a 30% cut on the iOS platform.\n\nEpic, which had long protested this cut, deliberately made changes in the iOS version of Fortnite in August 2020 so that in-app purchases could bypass Apple’s payment system in favor of Epic’s own.\n\nThis broke Apple’s policy, but Epic claimed it was doing so to pass on savings to its users.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple removed Fortnite from the App Store. Epic sued. Apple countersued and (mostly) won that fight, with a Californian court ruling in September 2021 that Apple has the right to terminate any Epic-affiliated developer account at its “sole discretion.”\n\nEpic had to pay Apple $3.65 million in breach-of-contract damages. (Apple also recently launched an attempt to claim over $73 million in legal fees stemming from the case, which Epic is furiously resisting.)\n\nFast-forward to late January of this year.\n\nWith the DMA’s debut little more than a month away, Apple announced it would allow third-party iOS app stores, but that any developer distributing an app through the new channels would have to pay a new €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” for every first installation of that app, whether that installation takes place via the third-party store or Apple’s own App Store.\n\nDownloads of the alternative app stores themselves would also trigger the fee, to be paid by the developers of the app stores.\n\nApple’s move earned an apoplectic reaction from many companies that were planning to launch their own iOS app stores—Meta and Microsoft are heavily lobbying Brussels to decide it is not compliant with the DMA—but Epic CEO Sweeney was the first to voice loud criticism.\n\n“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under [the] DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads,” Sweeney wrote on X on Jan. 25.\n\n‘Undercut’ assurances\n\nDespite its protests about Apple’s “malicious compliance” with the DMA, Epic said it would take up Apple’s terms and launch an iOS app store in Europe.\n\nHowever, on Feb. 23, Apple executive Phil Schiller wrote to Sweeney—Epic yesterday published the email exchange—to point out that Epic had previously “entered into agreements with Apple and then broken them.”\n\nSchiller highlighted Sweeney’s “colorful criticism of our DMA compliance plan” and said it “strongly” suggested Epic was going to again break its developer contract with Apple.\n\nSchiller asked Sweeney for “written assurance that you are also acting in good faith, and that Epic Games Sweden will, despite your public actions and rhetoric, honor all of its commitments.”\n\nSweeney quickly responded: “Epic and its subsidiaries are acting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple, and we’ll be glad to provide Apple with any specific further assurances on the topic that you’d like.”\n\nThree days later, Sweeney again took to X to accuse Apple of “contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies,” adding that his rival was “a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers, and overlord to none.”\n\nIn a Mar. 2 legal letter that Epic published yesterday, Apple referenced this post as partial justification for its decision to cancel the developer account of Epic Games Sweden, which was to operate the mobile Epic Games Store and Fortnite in Europe.\n\nIn the letter, Apple’s lawyers said Sweeney’s “litany of public attacks on Apple’s policies, compliance plan, and business model” had “undercut” his “minimal assurances” to Schiller. Citing the 2021 Californian ruling that gave Apple the right to unilaterally cancel any Epic developer agreements, they announced Apple was doing just that.\n\n“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,” Apple said in a statement.\n\nIn its post yesterday, Epic said Apple was “undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.”\n\nTesting the Commission\n\nApple will probably have a tough time convincing the Commission that an American court ruling gives it the right to undermine a key plank of the DMA just as the new law comes into force.\n\nFor a start, Apple’s whole approach to DMA compliance—the very thing Sweeney was loudly protesting—has been downright petulant.\n\nWhen it announced the changes it was making to comply, Apple did so while complaining they “bring greater risks to users and developers.”\n\nThen, in February, Apple used another new demand of the DMA—that it allows the developers of third-party browsers such as Chrome to avoid using Apple’s WebKit browser engine—as an excuse to kill off home-screen web apps on iOS, again in the name of security.\n\nThis would have removed another avenue for developers who want to avoid Apple’s in-app payments cut, and the Commission swiftly threatened an investigation, forcing Apple to reverse its plan.\n\nThen, wrapping up a pre-DMA case in which Spotify was the complainant, the Commission on Monday hit Apple with a $2 billion fine for stopping streaming-app developers from telling their iOS users that they can get cheaper subscriptions outside Apple’s platform—which is possible because, yet again, it’s a way to avoid Apple taking a huge cut of the subscription fee.\n\nApple has to drop these “anti-steering” tactics anyway under the DMA and, as it announced its appeal, it accused the Commission of trying to “enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law.” It also accused Spotify and the Commission of “coordinating” in the case.\n\nSo Apple and the Commission were already at war before this latest Epic episode.\n\nReacting to Epic’s revelation, the Commission didn’t just say it was looking into the matter under the DMA—it also said it was “evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with two other laws, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Platform-to-Business (P2B) Regulation.\n\nThe still-quite-new DSA is a sister law to the DMA, covering platforms’ content rather than their competitive practices—it’s the law under which the Commission recently started investigating X (regarding disinformation) and TikTok (regarding child protection and ad transparency.)\n\nIn this case, the Commission wants to know whether Apple shutting down Epic Games Sweden’s developer account was a violation.\n\n“The DSA sets a requirement for clear, transparent terms and conditions, no arbitrary application of these terms and conditions, provision of statements of reasons in case a decision is taken, and the possibility for complaints and redress,” a Commission spokesperson said in an email. “If content is moderated and accounts are temporarily suspended or permanently terminated, this needs to be proportionate and in due regard to fundamental rights.”\n\nAs for the P2B Regulation, the issue is that a platform has to “notify a business user…before an account is terminated,” the spokesperson said. It’s not hard to see how Apple may have failed this test when its lawyers sent Epic that letter telling it that its Swedish developer account had been terminated “effective immediately.”\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem with Apple’s justification for nixing Epic’s app store is the fact that Sweeney’s criticism of Apple’s rules is something that the Commission effectively solicited.\n\nIt has been clear throughout the last few months that the changes companies make to comply with the DMA will be evaluated while taking account of “market feedback”—it wants affected companies to say their piece, and now Apple is punishing Epic for doing just that.\n\nThe Commission still hasn’t said what it thinks of Apple’s new “core technology fee,” but it was never going to do that before Thursday anyway. With the way Apple has conducted itself in recent weeks, it’s hard to see how the company isn’t cruising for a bruising.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "UPDATE 3-As Big Tech scrambles to meet EU rules, investigations seen as likely",
        "content": "(Adds the European Commission declines comment)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance have scrambled over the last six months to comply with landmark EU tech rules that come into force on Thursday, from overhauling online platforms to backroom engineering.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called \"Big Tech\" and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth. Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.\n\nIf any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.\n\nYet its introduction of new fees such as a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.\n\nVestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.\n\nRivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough. The Commission declined to comment.\n\nWith eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet's Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking.com and Expedia, which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.\n\nThat has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries. Google declined to comment.\n\nMeta, which said Instagram and Facebook users will be asked if their data can be shared between its services, could also run the risk of an investigation. Meta declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon and ByteDance may face less scrutiny initially as EU regulators focus their resources on one or two cases and ensure a case able to withstand a legal challenge, people familiar with the matter said. Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment while ByteDance did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nPressure for an EU investigation is also coming from the some of the big six companies themselves.\n\nAt least one has told the European Commission that it was not fair to have to play by the DMA rules while a rival flouts them, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nUnlike EU antitrust investigations which can take years to wrap, DMA enforcers have just a year to issue their findings.\n\n($1 = 0.9173 euros) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith, Jamie Freed and David Evans)",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said they want to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store, in a possible violation of digital rules that took effect in the 27-nation bloc Thursday.\n\nIt's a fresh escalation of the high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent years fighting Apple’s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps.\n\nEpic asserted Wednesday that Apple thwarted its attempt to set up its own iOS app marketplace to compete with Apple's App Store, calling it a breach of the EU's new Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe sweeping set of rules, designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant — a move it's long resisted.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement Thursday that it has “requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.” The rules threaten penalties that could reach into the billions for violations.\n\nApple has already been hit this week with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting music streaming competition.\n\nThe commission said it's “also evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU regulations including the Digital Services Act, a second set of regulations in the bloc's digital rulebook that prohibit tech companies from ”arbitrary application\" of their terms and conditions.\n\nEpic contended that Apple was brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store that it planned to set up in Sweden to serve European Union users.\n\nIt accused Apple of retaliating for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.\n\nApple said its action was justified because of Epic's previous unlawful actions and litigation that resulted in the U.S. court decision in 2021.\n\nApple ousted Epic from its App Store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users, while also helping recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world’s most ubiquitous devices.\n\n“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,'\" Apple said in a statement. \"In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”",

        "title": "Apple is making big App Store changes in Europe over new rules. Could it mean more iPhone hacking?",
        "content": "Apple is opening small cracks in the iPhone's digital fortress as part of a regulatory clampdown in Europe that is striving to give consumers more choices — at the risk of creating new avenues for hackers to steal personal and financial information stored on the devices.\n\nThe overhaul rolling out Thursday only in the European Union represents the biggest changes to the iPhone's App Store since Apple introduced the concept in 2008. Among other things, people in Europe can download iPhone apps from stores that aren't operated by Apple and are getting alternative ways to pay for in-app transactions.\n\nEuropean regulators are hoping the changes mandated by the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, will loosen the control that Big Tech's “digital gatekeepers” have gained over the products and services that consumers and businesses use as they become more dominant forces in everyday life.\n\nThe measures are taking effect just days after EU regulators fined Apple nearly $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for thwarting competition in the music streaming market.\n\nApple has lashed out at the new regulations for unnecessary security risks to iPhone users in Europe, exposing them to more scams and other malicious attacks launched from apps downloaded from outside its ecosystems and raising the specter of more unsavory services peddling pornography, illegal drugs and other content that the company has long prohibited in its App Store.\n\nDespite trying to maintain security safeguards while also adhering to the new rules in the 27-nation bloc, Apple is warning that “the changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap between the protections that Apple users outside of the EU can rely on and the protections available to users in the EU moving forward.”\n\nBut some smaller tech companies such as music streaming service Spotify and video game maker Epic Games are attacking the ways Apple is complying with the DMA as little more than a facade that's making a “mockery” of the regulations' intent.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Rather than creating healthy competition and new choices, Apple’s new terms will erect new barriers and reinforce Apple’s stronghold over the iPhone ecosystem,\" Spotify, Epic and more than two dozen other companies and alliances wrote in a March 1 letter to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm overseeing the DMA.\n\nEpic, which is behind the popular Fortnite game, also contends Apple is already brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store it planned to release in Sweden. Epic asserted Apple thwarted its attempt to compete as retaliation for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.\n\nRegulators so far haven’t objected to any of changes that Apple is making in an iPhone software update tailored to comply with the DMA.\n\nEurope's shifting digital landscape also is forcing changes at other technology powerhouses such as Google and Facebook, but the new regulations strike at the core of Apple's philosophy of maintaining ironclad control over every aspect of its products.\n\nThis “walled garden” approach conceived by late co-founder Steve Jobs begins with the meticulous design of the hardware and then extends into all the software powering it devices, as well as overseeing the commerce occurring on them.\n\nThe approach built an empire with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue — a measure of success that Apple directly traces to the trust it has built through decades of vigilant management of the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.\n\nEven Epic's Sweeney acknowledged that one of the reasons he uses an iPhone is because of the staunch security measures that Apple has deployed to thwart hackers and protect the privacy of its customers. That came during testimony in a May 2021 trial resulting in a U.S. judge ruling that the App Store isn't a monopoly.\n\nIn that decision, the judge required Apple to begin allowing links to outside payment options inside iPhone apps in the U.S. It's a requirement that the company began to allow earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on that issue.\n\nApple still doesn't permit alternative iPhone app stores in the U.S. or more than 100 other countries outside the EU.\n\nEuropean regulators appear convinced that the benefits consumers stand to reap from more competition will outweigh the increased security risks.\n\nOne potential positive is lower prices for digital transactions within apps if competing stores charge lower commissions than the 15% to 30% fees Apple has been imposing for years.\n\nBut critics are raising doubts that will happen because Apple still plans to charge fees after app downloads reach relatively low thresholds and have set up other hurdles that will make it daunting for alternative options to make significant inroads in Europe.\n\nFor its part, Apple insists the security problems being hatched by the DMA are so worrisome that it has been hearing from government agencies — especially those involved in defense, banking and emergency services — wanting to ensure they will be able to block employees with iPhones from accessing apps distributed from outside Apple's walled garden.\n\n“These agencies have all recognized that sideloading — downloading apps from outside the App Store — could compromise security and put government data and devices at risk,” Apple said.",

        "content": "(Adds detail)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - Apple has been asked by the EU to explain why it prevented Fortnite video-game maker Epic Games from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe and whether this breaches EU technology rules, antitrust regulators said on Thursday.\n\nThe iPhone maker on Wednesday terminated a new developer account created by Epic in Sweden in an attempt to put Fornite and other games back on iPhones in Europe by running its own game store on Apple's devices.\n\nEpic Games sought to take advantage of landmark EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which kick in on Thursday and require Apple to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.\n\nApple blocked the effort, citing Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.\n\n\"We have requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA (Digital Markets Act),\" a European Commission spokesperson said in an email.\n\n\"We are also evaluating whether Apple's actions raise doubts on their compliance with the DSA (Digital Services Act) and the P2B (Platform to Business Regulation), given the links between the developer programme membership and the App store as designated VLOP (very large online platform).\"\n\nUnder the DSA, decisions suspending or terminating accounts have to be proportionate and with due regard to fundamental rights while the P2B requires a platform to notify a business user when terms and conditions are changed and before an account is closed.\n\nApple reiterated on Thursday that it exercised its rights which has been determined by courts.\n\n\"Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion',\" an Apple spokesperson said.\n\n\"In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.\"\n\nEpic on Wednesday said Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - From overhauling online platforms to backroom engineering, Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance have scrambled over the last six months to comply with landmark EU tech rules that come into force on Thursday.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called \"Big Tech\" and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth.\n\nCriticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.\n\nIf any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could face fines up to 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.\n\nYet its introduction of new fees such as a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.\n\nVestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.\n\nRivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough.\n\nWith eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet's Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking.com and Expedia, which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.\n\nThat has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries. Google declined to comment.\n\nMeta, which said Instagram and Facebook users will be asked if their data can be shared between its services, could also run the risk of an investigation. Meta declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon and ByteDance may face less scrutiny initially as EU regulators focus their resources on one or two cases and ensure a case able to withstand a legal challenge, people familiar with the matter said. Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment while ByteDance did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nPressure for an EU investigation is also coming from the some of the big six companies themselves.\n\nAt least one has told the European Commission that it was not fair to have to play by the DMA rules while a rival flouts them, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nUnlike EU antitrust investigations which can take years to wrap, DMA enforcers have just a year to issue their findings.\n\n($1 = 0.9173 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith and Jamie Freed)",

        "title": "OpenAI’s success has put a huge target on its back",
        "content": "OpenAI is the world’s hottest startup. It not only set the stage for the generative AI explosion thanks to the launch of its ChatGPT in November 2022, but it’s also powering Microsoft’s (MSFT) push into the space via a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that gives the tech giant a roughly 49% stake in the company’s for-profit subsidiary.\n\nThe company is now valued as high as $86 billion, according to Bloomberg. And with its latest product, the generative AI video platform Sora, making waves, CEO Sam Altman and company are riding higher than ever.\n\nBut OpenAI’s success has also put a massive target on its back. The company is facing a slew of headwinds ranging from lawsuits and government investigations to increasing competition from established players like Google. And some of those could pose an existential threat to OpenAI as it’s currently constituted.\n\nLawsuits on lawsuits\n\nOpenAI’s latest trouble comes from a familiar place: co-founder Elon Musk. Last week, the Tesla CEO filed a lawsuit against the generative AI company claiming it is in breach of contract. Musk claims in the suit that OpenAI is in violation of its founding agreement by using its technology to grow its for-profit arm rather than for the benefit of humanity.\n\nMusk wants OpenAI to make all of its technologies public and to prevent it from making any money for Microsoft, which uses OpenAI’s models for its various AI Copilot offerings. After helping to found OpenAI in 2015, Musk left the company in 2018 over disagreements about the company’s future and, last year, founded an AI company of his own called x.AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman participates in the \"Technology in a turbulent world\" panel discussion during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024. (Markus Schreiber/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe New York Times is also suing OpenAI as well as Microsoft, claiming that the companies are benefiting from the use of the Times’ copyrighted material. The Times says OpenAI used its content without permission to train its models, which are now benefiting both the company and Microsoft. The Times wants OpenAI to destroy any content that was trained using its materials.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe paper isn’t the only media company looking to take on OpenAI. The Intercept, Raw Story, and AlterNet are also suing the firm, saying it used their data to train its models. The organizations are seeking damages and calling on OpenAI to delete any training data “from which author, title, copyright, and terms of use information was removed.”\n\nRemoving training data from OpenAI’s large language models could impact their overall performance.\n\nRegulators are circling\n\nOpenAI is also facing regulatory scrutiny in the US and abroad. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the midst of a probe into whether or not OpenAI misled investors. The inquiry followed the OpenAI board’s decision to fire Altman in November, saying he hadn’t been consistently candid with its members. OpenAI rehired Altman less than two weeks after he was removed.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is also looking into OpenAI and its dealings with Microsoft, as well as those of its rivals, as the entity examines the potential impact of major cloud providers investing heavily in generative AI companies. The FTC is looking at Amazon and Google’s investments in OpenAI competitor Anthropic.\n\nOverseas, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is seeking comments from the public with regards to whether OpenAI and Microsoft’s deal should be considered a relevant merger situation and what kind of impact that will have on competition in the market.\n\nThe European Commission, meanwhile, is looking into whether Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship is reviewable under the EU’s Merger Regulation.\n\nCompetition is growing\n\nOpenAI is also staring down increasing competition from some of its biggest rivals. On Monday, Anthropic announced its Claude 3 family of large language models. According to the company, its largest model, Claude 3 Opus, can take on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) is also aiming to take on OpenAI with its Gemini family of models. But the company flubbed the rollout of its Gemini image generator and pulled it off the market pending an update.\n\nApple (AAPL) is also looking to get into the generative AI market, with Tim Cook saying that the company is investing heavily in the technology. And while Apple is unlikely to launch an enterprise generative AI model to directly rival OpenAI’s GPT offerings, it could reveal on-device generative AI capabilities that will draw consumers’ attention away from ChatGPT and its ilk.\n\nBut OpenAI’s challenges aren’t necessarily a sign that the company is in any immediate danger. Lawsuits and regulatory actions can take years to wind their way through the courts if they even get that far. And with Microsoft in its corner, the company has an enormous war chest to pull from to fund its research into larger, more powerful AI models. But with the company sitting at the top of the AI mountain at the moment, it’s sure to face more challenges in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "When we talk about stocks that have been overlooked, it usually means that they haven’t been receiving a lot of buzz. It could also mean these stocks have underperformed their peers or the benchmark S&P 500, and likely have some catching up to do. When it comes to investing, it often pays to look at companies that others are overlooking.\n\nThe three stocks we’ve chosen for this article span a wide range of industries. We believe that despite how they have performed so far this year, there is a lot more upside to come. So whether it is a semiconductor titan, a growing crypto miner or an elevator manufacturer, it’s definitely worth looking at overlooked stocks and zig when others zag. Here are our top choices for overlooked stocks that should be on your radar for the rest of 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest chip fabrication company. What does that mean? It designs and manufactures semiconductors for other companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Currently, Wall Street analysts project a one-year target range of $125.77 to $160.00.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHow can one of the world’s largest companies be overlooked? Well, if you haven’t noticed, AI and chip stocks have completely taken over this market. Two of TSMC’s largest customers are NVIDIA and Arm Holding (NASDAQ:ARM). These stocks have returned 70.82% and 105.5% respectively to shareholders in 2024 so far. But without TSMC, none of these companies would be able to sell their high-powered chips. If demand for these chips is as high as these companies say it is, then TSMC has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nThere is also a bit of a dark cloud that hangs over this stock. Many investors have shied away from TSMC due to concerns over China. Nonetheless, with the stock trading at a friendly multiple of just 21x future earnings and a fairly reasonably 10x TTM sales, TSMC is a pick-and-shovel play for the hottest industry on the planet.\n\nStory continues\n\nCleanSpark Inc (CLSK) Bitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) is a Bitcoin mining company that utilizes sustainable and renewable energy sources. It has risen as of late due to the rally in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but we believe that this bull run is just starting.\r\n\r\nBut, how can a stock that has already returned 64% in 2024 be considered under-the-radar? That’s because we believe there are exponentially more gains to be made this year. Bitcoin miners tend to rise as the price of Bitcoin does. In April, the Bitcoin halving will effectively cut that output in half for miners. But CleanSpark is already prepared for this. The company is purchasing four, fully-operational Bitcoin mining facilities to account for the drop in revenue. Compared to the industry average post-halving cost-to-mine price of $47,117 per BTC, CleanSpark’s average price is just $28,093.\n\nWith analyst targets of more than $100,000 by the end of 2024, CleanSpark is a company that not many have heard of which can provide exponential returns during this crypto bull run.\n\nOtis Worldwide Corporation (OTIS) momentum stocks: a smartphone screen displaying the Otis Worldwide (OTIS) logo\n\nSource: rafapress/shutterstock.com\n\nOtis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS) is the world’s largest elevator manufacturing and maintenance company. The odds are high that we have all ridden in one of its elevators at some point in our lives. This is exactly the type of boring stock that compounds gains year after year. As of March, Wall Street analysts are putting OTIS’s one-year target range between an average of $95.40 to a high of $105.00.\r\n\r\nWe’re not going to try and sugarcoat it, this is a boring stock. How many of you even knew that Otis was a publicly traded company? The company only went public in 2020 after it was spun off from United Technologies. Since then, it has returned more than 111% to shareholders and has raised its dividend by an average of 19.4% each year. With an amazing profit margin also set to continue increasing in 2024, Otis is definitely a company that will lift the returns of any portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "SEC adopts landmark climate rule — here's what that means for public companies",
        "content": "For the first time, US public companies will be required to tell investors about their exposure to climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commissionapproved requiring US-listed companies to communicate how they are managing material risks related to climate change and how those risks affect their bottom lines. Large companies will also be required to disclose their direct emissions from their operations and energy use, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\n\"I think it's important for the US to have its own standards based on US law, based on the economics of our markets, based upon what investors here are using to make investment decisions, and I think today's action is that important step for our US capital markets,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said during the meeting. \"These roles will enhance the disclosures that investors have been relying on to make their investment decisions. Issuers and investors will benefit from the consistency, comparability, reliability of these disclosures.\"\n\nThe measure passed 3-2 along political lines following two years of review and over 24,000 comments on the proposal.\n\nNo Scope 3 standard\n\nThe SEC notably pared back the final ruling, trimming a provision that would have required companies to report their Scope 3 impact — that is, indirect emissions from suppliers and consumers.\n\nThe Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.\n\nSEC's exclusion of Scope 3 data is considered a win for many businesses given that indirect emissions make up the largest and fastest-growing category of emissions. The SEC voted in favor of climate disclosure requirements for public companies on Wednesday. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nScope 3 categories include emissions from purchased goods, employee commutes, projects financed, and the use of products sold, among others. In the oil and gas sector, Scope 3 emissions can account for up to 95% of emissions; in financial services companies, the figure is even higher, at up to 99%.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, the landmark ruling by Wall Street's top regulator sets mandatory requirements — detailed in the SEC press release — that provide greater consistency, comparability, and reliability in climate data so that investors and consumers can make more informed decisions.\n\n\"I think what's kind of most important is that the information begins to flow,\" Bryan McGannon, managing director at US SIF (The Sustainable Investment Forum), told Yahoo Finance. \"So even if it doesn't include Scope 3 information, investors are going to get, for the first time, companies reporting their climate risk.\"\n\nJosh Griffin, co-founder and chief policy officer at nZero, a climate data platform,told Yahoo Finance that companies are \"seeing that their customers want a better understanding, and it’s showing up in market choices. Companies that not only invest in technologies to reduce their emissions, but [also] are transparent about their efforts, are being rewarded by their customers. This is where these regulatory requirements from the SEC are so vital because they create consistency and shared expectations.\"\n\nWhat the SEC climate rule means for companies\n\nThe landmark rule will affect thousands of companies, many of which already provide this information publicly on a voluntary basis or to comply with other regulations.\n\nCompanies will now face four main types of disclosure requirements when they register with the SEC and in their annual reports: What their climate risks are, how they are adapting to those risks, how the board of directors is overseeing climate strategy, and how climate targets will affect the business.\n\nLarge non-exempt companies will also have to list their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Many already track that information: As of 2022, nearly all S&P 500 companies and 90% of Russell 1000 companies published sustainability reports, according to the Governance & Accountability Institute.\n\n\"There are fairly well established methods for being able to build out Scope 1 [data],\" Rob Fisher, the US ESG Leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. \"Scope 2, frequently, it's not overly complicated. There are many aggregation services ... that are able to get your scope two emissions.\"\n\nThe SEC expects large corporations such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Exxon (XOM) to begin reporting their climate risk-related information in their fiscal year 2025 and to report their greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal year 2026. They will also need to submit a limited third-party review of their emissions data by 2029 and a full audit by 2033. A man watches a plane pass by as he stands on the balcony of a building at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany, Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSmaller companies and emerging growth companies will have an additional two years to disclose their climate risks and will not be required to report their emissions, which provides space for new technological developments to evolve.\n\n\"The climate rule got issued in March 2022 was basically before the rise of generative AI,\" KPMG's Fisher noted. \"And now, you know, things have kind of gone crazy. … So, I think the intersection of AI and this new reporting requirement is quite interesting because we can do some things very differently now in how we address the rule this time around than we could last time.\"\n\nFisher noted that for \"most organizations, building out a Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas inventory is certainly not trivial, depending on the scope and size of the operation. But certainly ... the big thing is that the data generally resides inside the virtual four walls of the organization.\"\n\nHow prepared they actually are to meet these requirements is not entirely clear. A KPMG survey found that 4 out of 5 companies say they are ahead of their peers when it comes to sustainability reporting, yet nearly half still lean on spreadsheets to manage data instead of advanced data systems.\n\n\"The tools are more readily available and more seamless for companies to gather their Scope 1 and 2 emissions,\" nZero's Griffin said. \"Scope 3 still presents a lot of challenges because of jurisdictional issues, but the market for collecting such data has also grown quite a bit in the last 2 years.\"\n\nSEC went to 'great lengths'\n\nThe SEC's rule marks a step-up in climate disclosure requirements, and it's been a long time coming.\n\nSince 1971, the SEC has recommended that companies communicate the cost of complying with environmental regulations. In 2010, the agency went further to suggest that companies should voluntarily provide details about their exposure to climate risks, if material.\n\nIncreasing extreme weather events, scrutiny around inflated sustainability claims, and pressure from activists, investors, and governments only heightened the pressure for mandatory disclosures.\n\nBy 2021, the SEC began seeking feedback on the shape of climate disclosure policy. When it released its draft proposal in March 2022, it drew polarized responses from groups on both sides of the aisle that only intensified as ESG investing became a political lightning rod.\n\nAnd while the rule has been finalized, the issue is far from settled. Lawsuits against the SEC are virtually guaranteed, experts say, something Gensler has been preparing for.\n\nAlthough the removal of the Scope 3 rule may lessen the risk of litigation from the US Chamber of Commerce, American Farm Bureau Federation, and National Association of Manufacturers, it could provoke the opposite reaction from green groups.\n\n\"I think what has taken them long to come to the final rule was to make sure that what was in the final rule is as durable as possible to withstand litigation challenge,\" US SIF's McGannon said. \"I think they went to really great lengths to ensure that the rule would stand.\" A solar tower and panels operate at Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park near the COP28 UN Climate Summit, on Monday, Dec. 11, 2023, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nClimate regulations around the world\n\nCompanies have also been closely watching whether the SEC's rule would align with disclosure requirements that have gained traction around the world or else join what Fisher called a \"patchwork quilt\" of regulations that collectively raise compliance costs.\n\nOne benchmark is the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which took effect on Jan. 5, 2023. The EU law has a broader definition of materiality that includes human and environmental impacts as well as financial impacts. The EU also mandates reporting of Scope 3 emissions, which the SEC stopped short of.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong have also set climate reporting standards. And earlier this year, China hinted at joining them.\n\nThen there's California's climate disclosure law, signed by governor Gavin Newsom in October 2023, which made the state the first in the US to approve such a measure. It also set the stage for legislators in New York and Illinois to follow suit with their own climate disclosure bills.\n\nCalifornia's two climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, go much further by requiring disclosures from both private and public companies that do business in the state. Those with revenues over $500 million must publish their climate risk plans, and those with over $1 billion in revenue are required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe effect is that many large multinationals or companies with operations in California will be required to report Scope 3 emissions even if the SEC is not requiring them to do so.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Apple shares have been pressured by concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union.\n\nThe stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday, its sixth straight negative session.

Based on this, “this is the most oversold AAPL/QQQ has been since early 2018.”\n\nBespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a post on X that Apple is more than three standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, and that “it hasn’t been this oversold since March 16th, 2020 in the throes of the COVID crash.”\n\nEven with the stock’s recent weakness, Apple shares trade near 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average multiple of 19.\n\nDespite the selloff, options traders are showing few signs of fear, buoyed by the broader optimism about the biggest technology stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nImplied volatility for three-month options has picked up from recent lows, but is around the middle of the range for the past year.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in March, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. After oscillating between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all climbed to record highs in 2024.\n\nThough there have been select pockets of strength fueling this surge in the broader market, Wall Street's gains primary fall on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have powered the broader market higher\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to seven of the largest and most-influential businesses that have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over an extended stretch. These seven stocks are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAs noted, these stocks have run circles around the S&P 500 for quite some time. MSFT Chart\n\nBut what they've really brought to the table for investors is sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in various aspects of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the world's leading desktop operating system, while Azure accounts for a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spending, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Apple's ongoing innovation has given the iPhone a commanding market share lead among smartphones in the United States. The former largest company in the world also boasts the beefiest share repurchase program on the planet. Nvidia's has become the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for up to a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. Further, Amazon Web Services tops Microsoft's Azure as the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google is a practical monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure provider, and YouTube is the second most-visited social site. Meta Platforms oversees the top social media assets, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Meta's family of apps attracted close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the first automaker to build itself from the ground up to mass-production in over a half-century. It's also the only pure-play EV maker generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven companies could differ greatly. As we motor into March, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain hiding in plain sight, while another highflier is liable to contend with mounting headwinds.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in March: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven long-term outperformers listed above, the most-attractive Magnificent Seven stock for opportunistic investors in March is Alphabet.\n\nIf Alphabet can be faulted for anything, it's being a cyclical company. Last year, 76% of the company's $86.3 billion in net sales were traced back to advertising. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's practically a given that businesses would pare back their ad budgets. At the moment, a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators do signal a high likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, economic cycles aren't even. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, there have been two periods of growth that sustained for longer than a decade. Advertising-driven businesses like Alphabet (and Meta, since we're discussing the Magnificent Seven) are primed for long-term upside as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThere's no question that Alphabet's internet search segment Google is its foundation. A nearly 92% share of worldwide search makes Google the undisputed company businesses are going to seek out for ad placement in order to target consumers. More often than not, Alphabet should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut as I've noted in the past, the Alphabet growth story is about far more than just its dominant internet search engine. Google Cloud has gobbled up about 10% of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its relatively early stages, which suggests this segment can grow by a sustained double-digit pace.\n\nWhat's more, Google Cloud delivered its first year of operating profits in 2023 after multiple years of losses. Cloud services consistently boast higher margins than advertising, which suggests Alphabet's cash flow growth is set to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nYouTube is a beast, too. Daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds), which were introduced in 2021, have catapulted from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to more than 50 billion in early 2023. This should help the company draw in advertisers, as well as boost high-margin subscriptions to YouTube.\n\nLastly, Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. Since Alphabet reinvests a lot of what it generates from its operations, cash flow is the best metric to value the company. Investors can buy Alphabet shares right now for a little over 12 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which is a 31% discount to its trailing-five-year cash flow multiple. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in March: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is poised for continued glory. Among the seven most-influential companies driving Wall Street higher over the past year and change, it's semiconductor stock Nvidia that should be avoided like the plague.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has enjoyed ample competitive advantages in the AI arena. GPU scarcity has driven prices of its A100 and H100 chips to the moon, which in turn allowed the company to more than double its sales last year. While Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, the company is set to face headwinds galore.\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest problems is itself. As supply chain issues ease and Nvidia expands production of its A100 and H100 GPUs to meet more demand, scarcity of GPUs will decline. Price-driven scarcity accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's sales gains last year, as evidenced by cost of revenue declining through the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). As Nvidia expands production, it'll likely cannibalize its own margins.\n\nNvidia will also have competition coming at it from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices is stepping up the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel is set to begin fulfilling orders for its Gaudi3 AI-GPU later this year.\n\nThe real concern is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers are also developing AI data center chips of their own. This includes Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, which account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's sales. Not only is it highly unlikely that these four companies will sustain recent purchase activity from Nvidia, but the AI chips they're developing will lessen future reliance on the current AI kingpin.\n\nRegulators aren't doing Nvidia any favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of high-powered AI chips to China. This includes AI GPUs that Nvidia had developed specifically for the world's No. 2 economy after regulators initially clamped down on exports. Regulators could be costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nFollowing the money of company insiders is another reason to avoid Nvidia like the plague. While there have been plenty of sales, there hasn't been a single insider purchase in more than three years. Insiders only buy for one reason: they believe the stock will head higher. If they aren't adding, why should you?\n\nBut maybe the biggest concern for Nvidia and its shareholders is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption of new technology and innovation; and it appears to be happening in real time, once again.\n\nNvidia is valued at close to 34 times its trailing-12-month sales, which is a valuation reminiscent of Cisco Systems during the height of the dot-com bubble. This makes Nvidia an interesting story stock, but one to avoid like the plague for investment purposes in March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple's iPhone sales in China fell by nearly a quarter in the first six weeks of 2024 year on year, in the latest sign that the US smartphone giant is losing more ground in the country to a resurgent Huawei Technologies, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\n\nOverall smartphone sales fell 7 per cent year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, with Chinese brands Oppo and Vivo experiencing sales declines of 29 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, according to Counterpoint.\n\nApple's iPhone sales fell 24 per cent over the period, giving it 15.7 per cent of the Chinese market and ranking the US firm fourth after Vivo, Huawei, and Honor. Counterpoint said \"fierce competition\" and an \"unusually high sales base in January 2023\" were the main reasons behind the decline in iPhone sales.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei was the biggest winner in the period, with the Shenzhen-based giant achieving a 64 per cent jump in sales, giving it 16.5 per cent of the market. Honor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, saw a 2 per cent increase in sales, giving it 16.3 per cent of the China market.\n\nCounterpoint said Huawei benefited from strong demand for its flagship 5G-capable Mate 60 series, launched late last year with a powerful home-grown chip, the Kirin 9000S. Chinese netizens have hailed the smartphone as symbolic of China's ability to defy tough US sanctions.\n\nSome analysts say Apple has been slow to adopt generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools into its devices compared with domestic brands, as competition intensifies in the high-end market segment.\n\nChinese smartphone makers such as Honor and Xiaomi showcased their generative AI prowess at industry event MWC Barcelona 2024 in late February.\n\nStory continues\n\nXiaomi, which has 13.8 per cent of the Chinese handset market, recently launched its flagship photography-focused smartphone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, into the luxury segment with prices starting from 6,499 yuan (US$903).\n\nHonor showcased its Magic6 Pro with AI features at MWC Barcelona 2024. The Magic Portal function uses AI to understand user behaviour and streamline tasks, such as direction requests in map apps.\n\nApple-authorised retailers on the mainland have started offering steep discounts on the latest iPhone 15 series, in an effort to revive sales.\n\nIn promotional events on Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall and rival JD.com, the top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max, launched last September, can be bought for 8,849 yuan (US$1,230), roughly 1,150 yuan cheaper than the official list price.

        "title": "Europe's Digital Markets Act is forcing tech giants to make changes. Here's what that will look like",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Europeans scrolling their phones and computers this week will get new choices for default browsers and search engines, where to download iPhone apps and how their personal online data is used.\n\nThey're part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act, a set of European Union regulations that six tech companies classed as “gatekeepers” — Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — will have to start following by midnight Wednesday.\n\nThe DMA is the latest in a series of regulations that Europe has passed as a global leader in reining in the dominance of large tech companies. Tech giants have responded by changing some of their long-held ways of doing business — such as Apple allowing people to install smartphone apps outside of its App Store.\n\nThe new rules have broad but vague goals of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable.\" They are kicking in as efforts around the world to crack down on the tech industry are picking up pace.\n\nHere's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:\n\nWHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES?\n\nSome 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media platforms, will be in the DMA's crosshairs.\n\nThey include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and Android operating system, plus Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari Browser and iOS.\n\nMeta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's Windows and LinkedIn.\n\nThe companies face the threat of hefty fines worth up to 20% of their annual global revenue for repeated violations — which could amount to billions of dollars — or even a breakup of their businesses for “systematic infringements.”\n\nWHAT EFFECT WILL THE RULES HAVE GLOBALLY?\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a fresh milestone for the 27-nation European Union in its longstanding role as a worldwide trendsetter in clamping down on the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bloc has previously hit Google with whopping fines in antitrust cases, rolled out tough rules to clean up social media and is bringing in world-first artificial intelligence regulations.\n\nNow, places like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and India are drawing up their own versions of DMA-like rules aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.\n\n\"We’re seeing copycats around the world already,\" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. The DMA “will become the defacto standard” for digital regulation in the democratic world, he said.\n\nOfficials will be looking to Brussels for guidance, said Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London.\n\n“If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA to avoid fragmentation and the risk of taking a different approach that fails,” he said.\n\nHOW WILL DOWNLOADING APPS CHANGE?\n\nIn one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes installed on its mobile devices.\n\nThe company has long resisted such a move, with a big chunk of its revenue coming from the 30% fee it charges for payments — such as for Disney+ subscriptions — made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that “sideloading” apps will come with added security risks.\n\nNow, Apple is cutting those fees it collects from app developers in Europe that opt to stay within the company’s payment-processing system. But it's adding a 50-euro cent fee for each iOS app installed through third-party app stores, which critics say will deter the many existing free apps — whose developers currently don't pay any fee — from jumping ship.\n\n“Why would they possibly opt into a world where they have to pay a 50 cent per-user fee?” said Avery Gardiner, Spotify's global director of competition policy. “So those alternative app stores will never get traction, because they’ll be missing this huge chunk of apps that would need to be there in order for customers to find the store attractive.\"\n\n“That is utterly at odds with the very purpose of the DMA,” Gardiner added.\n\nBrussels will be closely scrutinizing whether tech companies are complying.\n\nEU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said this week that after 10 years on the job, “I have seen quite a number of antitrust cases and quite a lot of creativity built into how to work around the rules that we have.\"\n\nHOW WILL PEOPLE GET MORE OPTIONS ONLINE?\n\nConsumers won't be forced into default choices for key services.\n\nAndroid users can pick which search engine to use by default, while iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their go-to. Europeans will see choice screens on their devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.\n\nThe idea is to stop people from being nudged into using Apple’s Safari browser or Google’s Search app. But smaller players still worry that they might end up worse off than before.\n\nUsers might just stick with what they recognize because they don't know anything about the other options, said Christian Kroll, CEO of Berlin-based search engine Ecosia.\n\nEcosia has been pushing for Apple and Google to include more information about rival services in the choice screens.\n\n“If people don’t know what the alternatives are, it’s rather unlikely that many of them will select an alternative,” Kroll said. “I’m a big fan of the DMA. I am not sure yet if it will have the results that we’re hoping for.”\n\nHOW WILL INTERNET SEARCHES CHANGE?\n\nSome Google search results will show up differently, because the DMA bans companies from giving preference to their own services.\n\nSo, for example, searches for hotels will now display an extra \"carousel\" of booking sites like Expedia. Meanwhile, the Google Flights button on the search result display will be removed and the site will be listed among the blue links on search result pages.\n\nUsers also will have options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising based on their online activity.\n\nGoogle users are getting the choice to stop data from being shared across the company’s services to help better target them with ads.\n\nMeta is allowing users to separate their Facebook and Instagram accounts so their personal information can't be combined for ad targeting.\n\nThe DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other. Meta, which owns the only two chat apps that fall under the rules, is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can exchange text messages, videos and images.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks came under pressure as a trio of tech heavyweights fell, with traders wading through mixed economic data in the run-up to Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised. Egypt’s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in Reach Nikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden Rematch Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Trump, Biden Ride Super Tuesday Wins to Rematch Few Want\n\nEquities lost traction after a rally that has spurred concern about sky-high valuations — especially in megacaps, leaving the group vulnerable to big moves in the face of bad news. Apple Inc.’s iPhone woes in China deepened while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US roadblock in selling an artificial-intelligence chip to the Asian nation. And Tesla Inc. extended its rout as China shipments slumped.\n\nBullish positioning in US technology stocks is at the highest in three years — raising the risk of a pullback, according to Citigroup Inc.’s Chris Montagu. Long positioning in Nasdaq 100 futures is “extremely extended,” he said.\n\n“Trees don’t grow to the sky,” said Kenny Polcari at SlateStone Wealth. “What is starting to concern some investors is whether or not some of these tech companies that have gotten stretched can in fact live up to the ‘lofty valuations’ that investors have placed on them.”\n\nWall Street also weighed data showing the US service sector cooled — even as orders and business activity picked up. Caution prevailed, with Powell heading to Capitol Hill for his semiannual testimony before Congress, where the Federal Reserve chief is expected to reiterate the lack of urgency to cut rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1%, while the Nasdaq 100 slipped almost twice as much. Tesla extended a two-day selloff to 11%, while Apple suffered its fifth straight loss. Nvidia Corp. rose. Treasury 10-year yields fell six basis points to 4.15%. Bitcoin slid after a record-setting run that topped $69,000. Gold also hit an all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nNever miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.\n\nThe “Magnificent Seven” — comprising Apple, Microsoft Corp., Nvidia, Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla — have powered the S&P 500 to all-time peaks this year, partly fueled by the AI frenzy.\n\nThe rally has left strategists scrambling to lift their 2024 targets — while raising questions on whether tech is seeing a boom or a bubble.\n\nTo JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic, the dramatic rally in US equities and Bitcoin signals accumulating froth — conditions that typically precede a bubble when asset prices rise at an unsustainable pace. Meanwhile, David Kostin at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among those who argue big tech’s lofty valuations are supported by fundamentals.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group helped drive the Nasdaq 100 to its fourth consecutive monthly gain.\n\n“The AI craze is a modern gold rush, and the tech ‘picks and shovels companies’ are seeing earnings explode as companies buy chips and cloud space to fuel the boom,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. “But if AI doesn’t result in increased profitability for the rest of the S&P 500 over the coming years, then demand for AI chips will evaporate as will AI-related cloud demand.”\n\nWith generative AI set to be the growth theme of the decade, UBS’s Chief Investment Office continues to believe that US tech stocks should make up a substantial portion of investors’ equity allocations. However, the firm says investors with excessive exposure should consider broadening tech exposure to capture the next growth opportunities.\n\n“While we see further room for the current tech rally to run, we think investors should review and optimize their exposure to technology to protect against potential declines and benefit from opportunities beyond big tech,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\n“Although we see pockets of speculation and the tech sector could be due for a breather, we don’t see a bubble,” said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. “Valuations are rich on most metrics, but with tech, comparative earnings momentum tends to be a more important near-term driver. And profit trends remain strong and are at new highs.”\n\nThe three-year outperformance of the tech sector to the S&P 500 is just above 30%, Lerner said. This is roughly in line with the 30-year average and far from the peak of just above 250% seen in March 2000, he added.\n\n“Comparisons to the dot-com bubble should be expected given the concentration of gains in the tech sector and proliferation of excitement around a new technology,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird. “But from 1996 to 1999, the average three-year trailing return was 96%. We are not yet close to those levels. There’s room to run.”\n\nValuations, earnings trends and market sentiment all refute speculation that an AI-driven tech bubble has reemerged in US large caps, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.\n\n“Our theme universe of AI stocks shows sales generally supporting price gains, with multiples in the middle of their five-year range,” they wrote. “Unless fundamental shortfalls emerge, high-market-cap concentration for mega-cap tech and strong returns for AI may not present material risk to the S&P 500.”\n\nThe largest five companies in the S&P 500 trade at less than half the multiples of the “Four Horsemen” — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell Technologies Inc. — in March 2000, which surpassed 80 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis, according to BI.\n\nAdditionally, valuations appear to be relatively contained across accelerating technology themes — such as AI, future of finance, cloud and robotics — with most baskets trading at or beneath five-year average price-to-sales multiples, they said.\n\n“While we stand by our argument that US stocks are not in a bubble, the confluence of a prospective Fed easing cycle and an attention-grabbing new technology does raise the risk that one might form later this year and into 2025,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “The easiest way to sidestep this problem would be for the Fed to delay rate cuts as long as possible.”\n\nWhile stock prices are not part of the Fed’s official mandate, Colas says he’s wondering whether Powell will try to dampen the market’s recent enthusiasm by delivering a more hawkish than expected message this week.\n\n“The AI frenzy combined with expectations for rate cuts in 2024 renewed ‘bubbly’ investor behavior,” according to the GMO Asset Allocation team. “If the projected Fed cuts fail to occur or growth companies fail to deliver on aggressive expectations, growth investors will likely wind up disappointed.”\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc. gave a forecast for revenue and profit in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling strong customer demand for the company’s expanding suite of cybersecurity offerings. Nordstrom Inc. is forecasting muted revenue and comparable sales growth this year as sluggish demand at its high-end namesake stores offsets an improving outlook at its off-price Rack stores. Target Corp.’s fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, as the retailer continued its improvements in inventory management and said its decline in traffic slowed. Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger is “extremely confident” that the company will meet its goal of showing a profit in its streaming TV businesses in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. A Citigroup Inc. reorganization aimed at streamlining the bank and making it more competitive with its peers has gone swifter than expected, Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said, as she set out positive guidance for the year ahead. New York Community Bancorp climbed after the stock tumbled 43% in prior two sessions after a pair of rating downgrades. Zillow Group Inc. fell after short seller Spruce Point Capital Management said it was betting against the stock and highlighted challenges facing the company, including antitrust litigation targeting broker commissions in the US housing industry.\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\nCanada rate decision, Wednesday Eurozone retail sales, Wednesday US ADP employment, JOLTS job openings, Wednesday Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee, Wednesday Fed issues Beige Book, Wednesday Fed’s Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis) and Mary Daly (San Francisco) speak, Wednesday China trade, forex reserves, Thursday European Central Bank’s rate decision, Thursday US initial jobless claims, trade, Thursday President Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union address, Thursday Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, Thursday Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, Thursday Eurozone GDP, Friday US nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, Friday New York Fed President John Williams speaks, Friday ECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann speaks, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 1% as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.8% The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% The MSCI World index fell 0.8%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0858 The British pound rose 0.1% to $1.2705 The Japanese yen rose 0.4% to 149.92 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 7.9% to $62,170.83 Ether fell 4.7% to $3,415.67\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined six basis points to 4.15% Germany’s 10-year yield declined seven basis points to 2.32% Britain’s 10-year yield declined 11 basis points to 4.01%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $78.16 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.7% to $2,129.88 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Alexandra Semenova and Yvonne Yue Li.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database Nvidia Is the Latest Shiny Object to Spur Stocks to New Heights\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Apple is having a rough start to the year for its iPhone sales in China, where sales were down 24% year-over-year in the first six weeks, according to a new report from research firm Counterpoint.\n\nThe analysts said the drop can mostly be attributed to stiff competition in the market, especially from China's Huaweii, which saw sales of its smartphones surge 64% over the same period compared to a year ago. China's Huawei saw domestic smartphone sales surge 64% year-over-year in the first six weeks of 2024.\n\n\"Primarily, [Apple] faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi,\" Counterpoint senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang, said in a statement.\n\nAPPLE'S NEW MACBOOK AIR MODELS ROLLING OUT THIS WEEK\n\n\"Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,\" Zhang added.\n\nShares of the iPhone maker were down 3% Tuesday and have lost about 10% of their value so far this year, underperforming their big tech peers in the United States.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Apple beat analysts' estimates on sales and profits last quarter primarily due to strong iPhone sales worldwide – except in China.\n\nCounterpoint's report said Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone market dropped to 15.7%, putting it in fourth place, compared with second place in the year-ago period when it had 19% market share.\n\nAPPLE HIT WITH NEARLY $2B EU ANTITRUST FINE\n\nApple beat Wall Street estimates on sales and profits last quarter, powered by growth in its iPhone business worldwide — but notably reported a lag in sales in China.

        "content": "*\n\nUS services sector cools in February, ISM survey shows\n\n*\n\nTarget forecasts FY comparable sales above estimates\n\n*\n\nApple drops after China iPhone sales plunge\n\n*\n\nIndexes down: Dow 1.04%, S&P 1.02%, Nasdaq 1.65%\n\n(Updates with final prices after market close)\n\nBy Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\nMarch 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street three major indexes all retreated more than 1% on Tuesday, with weakness in megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc and the chip sector weighing most on the Nasdaq ahead of this week's crop of economic data and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nTuesday's economic data was a mixed bag showing slower U.S. services industry growth in February as employment declined while a measure of new orders grew to a six-month high, signaling underlying strength in the sector.\n\nThe Purchasing Managers Index report on Tuesday confirmed continued economic growth despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Fed since March 2022.\n\nAnother survey showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods dropped more than expected in January.\n\nSome strategists saw the technology sell-off on Tuesday as the result of profit taking for a sector which had recently rallied after rising 56% in 2023.\n\n\"Maybe some people are taking chips off the table, taking some profits in the high flying areas, in conjunction with what is probably justified nerves before Powell speaks and before we get the big slew of labor market data,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nTwo reports helped to create a risk-off tone, said Craig Fehr, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones in St. Louis.\n\nApple shares finished down 2.8% after a research report showed iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024 as Apple faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.\n\nAlso the chip sector was battered after Bloomberg News reported that Advanced Micro Devices hit a roadblock in its efforts to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market as Washington cracks down on advanced technology exports to Beijing.\n\nStory continues\n\nChip rivals fell in sympathy with the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which closed down 2%.\n\nFehr also attributed some of Tuesday's weakness to recent rallies. The benchmark S&P 500 had hit a fresh intraday record high on Monday before closing slightly lower.\n\n\"It's reasonable and even healthy to take some pit stops along the way. This market is, to a degree, stopping for a breather after what's been a very sharp run higher,\" he said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 404.64 points, or 1.04%, to 38,585.19. The S&P 500 lost 52.3 points, or 1.02%, at 5,078.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 267.92 points, or 1.65%, to 15,939.59.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P 500 industry indexes declined, with technology ending down 1.2% and consumer discretionary falling 1.3%. Energy, up 0.7%, was the biggest gainer followed by consumer staples, which rose 0.3%.\n\nAlong with Powell's testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday, investors are also anxiously awaiting more clues about interest rate policy from economic data, including the crucial non-farm payrolls report, due out on Friday.\n\nThe majority of traders see the first rate cut this year in June, as per CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nAmong megacap technology stocks, Tesla shares sank 3.9% after its European Gigafactory near Berlin halted production following a suspected arson attack.\n\nOn the bright side, Target shares rallied 12% after the retailer forecast annual comparable sales largely above estimates, betting on same-day services, product launches and a new membership program to boost spending.\n\nMicrostrategy shares tumbled 21% after the bitcoin development company announced a private offering for $600 million in convertible senior notes, with proceeds to be used to buy bitcoin.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 113 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 13.22 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.99 billion average for the last 20 sessions.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard Chang)",

        "title": "Apple Shares Are Tanking. Here Are Levels Traders Are Watching",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders are eyeing Apple Inc. after its stock slid below a critical psychological threshold on Tuesday as shares entered a technical correction for the first time since August this month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge Tech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets Wrap Gold Climbs to Record as Momentum Builds on Bets Over Fed Pivot Olivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised. America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop.\n\nThe shares, which failed to hold the $180 support level last week, traded for less than $170 at various points during Tuesday’s session. Breaking through that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities.\n\n“Apple is one of the most influential stocks so it may see a bounce from here in the short-run after being oversold,” Sohn said over the phone. “But traders may still look to fade it at $180 because its trend has deteriorated so much.”\n\nRead more: Apple Stock Gloom Deepens as Pressure to Show AI Progress Mounts\n\nShares of the Cupertino, California-based company have shed nearly 12% this year after closing at a record in December, erasing more than $300 billion in market value. That’s cost Apple its crown as the most valuable US company to Microsoft Corp., as some of its Big Tech peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. keep reallying.\n\nApple is facing a slew of issues, including regulatory scrutiny of its App Store, declining sales in China and investor concerns over its growth prospects. Its fourth-quarter outlook also raised worries due to tepid demand for its handsets and other gadgets.\n\nNaturally, short sellers are pouncing. Apple was the the stock market’s second-most profitable short position in February at $606 million in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Apple Shorts Eye Key $180 Level With Caution\n\nWith Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that technology shares broadly may face pressure in the coming months, even with Nvidia’s dominance. The iPhone maker continues to set new lows relative to the $252 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nThat said, Birinyi Associates found that Apple’s correlation to the S&P 500 isn’t as tight as some may think. On a scale where 1 means a perfect directional relationship and 0 indicates no relationship at all, Apple clocks in at 0.65 compared with 0.69 for Nvidia and 0.36 for the average S&P stock, according to Jeff Rubin, director of research at Birinyi.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, this means the US stock market can continue to churn higher as long as Apple’s stock doesn’t break its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\n“While this isn’t an intermediate-term concern, and there’s ample evidence that ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks can certainly carry markets higher without the aid of Apple,” Newton wrote in a note to clients. “I view all weakness in Apple over the next month as likely making this stock quite attractive.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "VUG vs. VGT: Which Tech-Heavy ETF Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "ETFs allow investors to diversify their capital without much effort. Fund managers either take an active approach and carefully monitor individual positions or align their funds with established benchmarks. Vanguard is one of the leading firms that specializes in these types of funds. This article will dive into two popular Vanguard funds, one of which is tech-heavy, while the other is tech-exclusive: the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).\n\nI am bullish on both of these funds, but it’s important to know the nuances of each fund before getting started. This article will examine their similarities and differences so you can decide which one makes sense for you.\n\nBoth Funds Have Performed Well in the Long Term\n\nBoth of these funds have been neck-and-neck over the past year. VGT is up by 48.2%, while VUG has gained 47.8%. There is a larger gap between the funds when looking at five-year performances. While VGT gained 166.1% during that time, VUG was only up by 121.6%.\n\nEven though VGT has been the clear winner over the past five years, it’s hard to complain about the performance of either of these funds.\n\nInvestors don’t even have to worry much about these funds’ expense ratios eating away the returns. Vanguard is well-known for having low expense ratios for its funds, and the brokerage firm certainly delivers for these picks. VUG has a 0.04% expense ratio, while VGT has a 0.10% expense ratio.\n\nHow Much Do You Like Microsoft and Apple?\n\nThere’s more to VUG and VGT than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, these two stocks are the largest positions in both funds by wide margins.\n\nVUG offers more portfolio diversification for assets outside of these two tech giants. Microsoft makes up 13.2% of the fund’s total holdings, while Apple consists of 12.2% of the fund’s total assets. More than a quarter of VUG’s total holdings are in those two stocks.\n\nVGT is even more lopsided toward those tech conglomerates. The fund has 20.5% of its total assets in Microsoft and puts 20.2% of its capital into Apple. Those two stocks make up more than 40% of VGT’s total holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nVUG has the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven within its top 10 holdings. However, VGT deviates from this trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the only other Magnificent Seven stock within the fund’s top 10 holdings, as you can see below.\n\nVUG Has Been Catching Up\n\nWhile the five-year returns imply VGT is the better pick, this is a classic case of past results not guaranteeing future success. Although VGT has a big lead for that time horizon, VUG has outperformed it over the past six months. VUG is also the year-to-date winner, with a 10.5% return compared to VGT’s 8.6% return.\n\nI believe this trend will continue for a few reasons. The first reason is Apple stock. Although shares are up by 320% over the past five years, they are only up by 14.4% over the past year. Apple stock is actually down by 4% over the past six months.\n\nMore than 20% of VGT’s portfolio is down by 4% over the past six months. That distinction only applies to roughly 12% of VUG’s total portfolio. Now, Apple can turn things around if the Vision Pro becomes the next big product, and I believe that product has the potential to deliver great returns. However, the rest of the company’s growth slowed down significantly and offers very limited upside other than the Vision Pro.\n\nAnother big reason VUG looks more enticing is the portfolio composition. With Apple’s growth slowing, investors have to pay more attention to the other stocks in these funds’ portfolios. While both funds have Nvidia as their third largest holding, the funds deviate from there.\n\nVUG takes the expected approach of loading up on the Magnificent Seven stocks. That’s proven to be a good long-term decision, and those corporations have plenty of runway, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for now.\n\nI also have an issue with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) being VGT’s 9th largest holding. That stock makes up 1.56% of the fund’s total assets but hasn’t budged by much over the years.\n\nCisco stock is down by 6% over the past five years. While its dividend puts the investment in the positive, that’s not the pick you want to see in a growth fund’s portfolio. VGT has better five-year returns, but I believe VUG is poised to perform better over the next five years.\n\nIs VUG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nVUG is rated as a Strong Buy based on 172 Buys, 35 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average VUG stock price target of $378.47 implies 12.5% upside potential.\n\nIs VGT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMeanwhile, VGT is rated as a Moderate Buy, with 231 Buys, 76 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VGT stock price target of $575.87 implies 11.5% upside potential. Nonetheless, analysts’ ratings suggest VUG will continue to extend its recent lead.\n\nThe Bottom Line on VUG vs. VGT\n\nComparing stock charts doesn’t always yield the correct answer of which fund is the better pick. That seems to be the case with these funds. VGT has the better five-year returns but was more reliant on Apple’s ascent. VUG still has significant exposure to Apple but is better prepared for a slowdown in that stock.\n\nIf Apple’s Vision Pro turns the stock into a winner again, VGT will outperform VUG, but that’s not guaranteed to happen. Both of these funds are heavily dependent on Microsoft and Apple, but it looks like VUG has better top 10 holdings than VGT.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Facebook's services are among those affected - Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nUsers of YouTube and Facebook experienced disruption this afternoon, with hundreds of thousands of users reporting problems.\n\nIssues began around 3pm, with the outage affecting Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google. The outages have been tracked by the website Downdetector.\n\nAt 5:19pm, Meta announced that the outage affecting its services was now over. Google told The Telegraph that it “saw a surge in traffic ... and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.”\n\nLondon-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.”\n\nBut the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, which are typically imposed by governments.\n\nAccording to a Google status website, there were also reports of problems with some of its services aimed at advertisers.\n\nIt is understood that the outages were not caused by a cyberattack.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.\n\nIts failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.\n\nLord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.\n\n05:42 PM GMT\n\nGoogle says it has ‘scaled up’ services to combat issues\n\nA Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:\n\nWe saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.\n\n05:37 PM GMT\n\nFacebook says outage over\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:\n\nEarlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services.

The official said:\n\nWe are aware of the incident and at this time we are not aware of any specific election nexus or any specific malicious cyber activity.\n\n05:21 PM GMT\n\nOzempic boom saved Denmark from recession, say analysts\n\nSurging demand for weight-loss drugs helped to save Denmark from recession last year, a leading bank has said. Hannah Boland reports:\n\nDanske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.\n\nThe stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.\n\nAnalysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”\n\nNovo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.\n\nThe company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.\n\nSales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.\n\nHigh levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc. The injectable drug Ozempic has contributed to Danish economic growth - David J.

Meanwhile, Google’s Ad Manager is experiencing “service disruption”, according to its official status page, while Google is “investigating reports of an issue” with its AdMob and AdSense services.

Shares in Wincanton fell 4.5pc to 596p.\n\nThe business was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate.\n\nToday its main business is running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose.\n\n04:14 PM GMT\n\nEvery little helps as Tesco hikes shop workers’ pay\n\nTesco is to increase store workers’ pay by 9.1pc in an act worth roughly £300m.\n\nIt is the latest supermarket group to lift pay levels for workers ahead of the rise in the national minimum wage in April.\n\nThe national minimum wage will increase from its current rate of £10.42 per hour to £11.44 on April 1.\n\nThe grocery giant, which employs more than 330,000 people across the UK, will raise the basic hourly rate for store workers from £11.02 per hour to £12.02.\n\nIt will also increase the pay of workers within the M25 to £13.15 per hour, from a current rate of £11.95 for those in inner London and £11.75 for those in outer London.\n\nTesco UK chief executive Matthew Barnes said:\n\nThis represents another significant investment in our colleagues, building on the last two years of investment.\n\nWe recognise the amazing work our colleagues do every day in serving our customers and we’re really proud to offer such competitive rates of pay alongside a great range of exclusive colleague benefits.\n\nIt comes days after rival Asda said it will increase its basic rate of staff pay to £12.04 per hour later this year.

Mr Lynch took the fraud office to court last month in an effort to force it to hand over correspondence with US authorities, information that he believes could help his upcoming US criminal defence.\n\nDetails of the settlement are confidential.

It meant that Apple fell from the country’s second biggest smartphone maker a year ago to fourth.\n\nApple shares fell by more than 2.5pc in early trading in New York and have now dropped to their lowest level since late October. So far this year shares have fallen 8pc amid growing concern about its Chinese business.\n\nHuawei’s smartphone division had been hit by US sanctions but breakthroughs in chip design mean sales have climbed 64pc in the last year.

Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.\n\nThere is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.\n\nThis sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.\n\nKey to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless.

Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the companies \"deliberately obscured\" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.\n\nThe 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.\n\nBut the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to \"participation in a venture\" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.\n\nCircuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.\n\nShe added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.\n\n\"Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,\" Rao wrote. \"We hold that it does not.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTerry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.\n\nThe decision provides \"a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,\" he said. \"We are far from finished seeking accountability.\"\n\nGoogle had no immediate comment.

        "content": "Some stocks have been sitting on the sidelines amid this hot AI-driven market rally. Only time will tell when the market’s gains will broaden and help the year-to-date (YTD) losers; value-focused investors have a lot to love about the “left-behind” cohort. AI works its magic in more than just firms building AI models or GPUs powering them. In this piece, we’ll look at three mostly misunderstood tech stock laggards to buy,\n\nFar too many folks are quick to discount or dismiss AI plans entirely. Of course, nobody wants to play from behind when it comes to next-generation technologies, like generative AI. However, it’s much better to play late than not at all.\n\nLet’s check out three YTD tech losers I wouldn’t count out yet. Maybe, just maybe, one of them can be the tortoise that eventually overtakes the many hares in the tech scene!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock seems to be rolling down a steep hill at full speed, with shares plunging 7% on Monday’s flat-ish day for broader markets. Year to date, TSLA stock is down almost 25%. That’s a drastic decline in just north of two months. And while electric vehicles (EVs) are the hot tech trend of yesteryear, this sell-off could prove a buying opportunity for those with the pain tolerance to buy the dip.\n\nIt’s hard to believe, but Tesla stock has shed around 54% of its peak value. As EV sales hit a speedbump, investors should keep their sights on the road ahead, not the rear-view mirror. The company is working hard on advancing its battery tech, self-driving capabilities and Tesla Dojo supercomputer.\n\nIn the meantime, Dojo and its impressive AI talent alone make Tesla stock worth watching on the way down as other investors begin to view the firm as more of an auto play than an AI company.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was under some serious pressure on Monday, shedding around 3% of its value at the worst part of the trading day before closing off by 2.5%. Year to date, AAPL stock is down around 6%, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, Apple got slapped with a stiff fine — close to $2 billion — from the European Union (EU) due to its music-streaming dominance. These anti-trust penalties come amid increased fear that Apple may be behind in the generative AI race.\n\nMy take?\n\nDon’t discount the words of Apple’s legendary CEO, Tim Cook. Investors shouldn’t discount its potential if he’s hinting at generative AI tech on the horizon. Additionally, Apple quietly launched new Macbook Airs with the latest and greatest Apple Silicon: the M3 chip. The company calls it “the world’s best consumer laptop for AI.”\n\nOverlook the Macbook Air launch, but I think it’s the start of many AI-driven things for the year.\n\nAt around $175 per share, Apple stock goes for around 27.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), a pretty reasonable multiple to pay for one of the planet’s most cherished consumer products companies (and underrated AI innovators).\n\nEven if Apple’s playing from behind, it’s still very much in the game.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software company with a less-than-ideal start to 2024, with shares down around 9% year to date. The company, which makes software products for developers, is innovating on the AI front to stay ahead in its corner of productivity software.\n\nGiven the productivity-enhancing powers of generative AI, AI has become a must for Atlassian. Though AI could pave the way for rival firms, I’d argue Atlassian’s wide economic moat may not be so quick to narrow.\n\nFrom incorporating AI-generated summaries to offering a wide range of AI apps on its own marketplace, Atlassian has a world of upselling opportunities as it looks to showcase what AI has to offer at the workplace. The company aims to “accelerate work” with its suite of AI tools. And thus far, I’d say the firm’s done a great job of staying at the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s move to shutter its electric car efforts and divert those resources to artificial intelligence projects might have emboldened traders a year ago. Instead, the stock’s slump has only deepened.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmerica Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop. Supreme Court Rules Trump Can Appear on Presidential Ballots Wall Street’s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge AMD Hits US Roadblock in Selling AI Chip Tailored for China\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based firm has revealed very little about its AI efforts, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook promising the company’s shareholders last week that Apple would “break new ground” in AI. Investor impatience is growing, with the stock slumping 9% this year, pulling its market value below Microsoft Corp.’s.\n\n“There’s been a real focus on how Apple hasn’t come out with some killer product in a very long time,” said David Klink, senior analyst of equity research at Huntington National Bank. “Obviously it’s been kind of a hard time for Apple holders to watch Nvidia and whatnot.”\n\nRead More: Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey\n\nApple’s pivot comes as iPhone sales remain sluggish, with sales in China plunging during the first six weeks of this year. Its biggest new product release in years, the Vision Pro headset, is a long way off from contributing to sales growth in any meaningful way.\n\nWall Street is becoming more skeptical of the megacap giant. Apple was recently removed from Goldman Sachs’ conviction list and Evercore ISI’s tactical outperform list. The company has the lowest ratio of buy ratings to holds and sells since 2020.\n\nRead More: Apple’s iPhone Struggles in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge\n\n“Forget the car, what matters most for this stock is the AI strategy launch,” Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote in a note dated March 4. “To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Apple’s move away from EVs has been broadly welcomed, analysts are looking for the company to release its own generative AI product. Samsung Electronics Co.’s updated Galaxy line of smartphones can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.\n\n“Samsung has a generative AI phone right now and is getting a lot of positive buzz about it, and Apple doesn’t yet,” noted Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “Apple doesn’t have some of the current momentum drivers and so it’s lagging a bit, so I think it’ll be a second half story if some of these new products actually get out the door.”\n\nStill, for bulls, the firm’s potential to capture public imagination with an AI enhancement means that investors should be patient. Melius analysts see new AI services driving users to upgrade their iPhones, kicking off a “supercycle” in 2025.\n\n“It’s time for a deep breath,” wrote Melius’s Reitzes, noting that 99% of Apple’s installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices “are never going to switch to Android — so a ‘comeback’ is likely.”\n\nAnd, long-time investors say that being a late mover is nothing new for Apple. Counting them out in the early innings of the AI cycle would be a mistake, according to Robert Conzo, CEO and managing director at The Wealth Alliance LLC.\n\n“Apple’s doing what Apple does best — it kind of waits, sits back and then sees how it’s going to position its products to take advantage of the AI craze,” he said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has erased more than $300 billion in market value since its shares closed at a record in December and has entered a technical correction for the first time since August. A disappointing forecast, shrinking business in China, hefty regulatory fines and a lack of new hit products caused the iPhone maker’s stock to drop more than 10% from its peak, underscoring the risks to its supply chain in particular.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US government roadblock in attempting to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market, according to people familiar with the matter, part of Washington’s crackdown on the export of advanced technologies to the country.\n\nChina pledged to harness the entire nation’s resources to speed homegrown scientific breakthroughs, reaffirming a central priority to become self-reliant in spheres from AI to chipmaking to wrest technological supremacy from the US. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is leading a financing round of at least $600 million for Chinese AI startup MiniMax, spearheading its second major deal in the space this year as it unleashes capital in pursuit of growth RapidSOS, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to help emergency response teams, raised a $75 million investment led by BlackRock Inc. funds. Nio Inc.’s annual loss widened last year as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker faced fierce competition in the world’s biggest EV market. Nearly half of India’s internet users watched movies, television shows, news and sports on streaming platforms owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walt Disney Co. before they merged to form a media giant, according to Virgina-based data analytics firm Comscore.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nCrowdStrike HashiCorp\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Challenger brand Nothing is taking on Apple with a  $350 smartphone that could cure your tech addiction",
        "content": "Nothing, the upstart tech brand with a cult following, has just launched a budget version of its much-hyped Nothing Phone (2), the Nothing (2a) in India.\n\nWith 2.7 million sales and more than half a billion dollars in revenue since its launch, according to its CEO, the London-based brand is positioning itself as a cheap alternative to Apple and Samsung for smartphone-wary consumers with its latest cut-price model.\n\nNothing launches latest smartphone\n\nThe first Nothing Phone (1) was released in 2022 to great fanfare as its makers made the unusual promise of creating a phone that would offer customers an escape from the growing specter of screen time that increasingly captures users.\n\nNothing is building a smartphone line that encourages users to be more mindful of their screen time. In other words, it’s a phone built for tech-savvy buyers hoping to optimize their time.\n\nIt launched the Nothing (2) last year building upon the hype of its first product launch. \"We're not trying to be Apple 2023. We're trying to be the Apple of the 1980s,\" Nothing CEO Carl Pei told Forbes last year.\n\nNothing’s strategy has caught the attention of both customers and investors. In addition to its half a billion in sales, Nothing managed to raise $96 million for U.S. expansion last year.\n\nFor its third iteration, the Nothing (2a), the group says it is doubling down on the more popular elements of its Nothing (2) while offering a cheaper alternative to its predecessor’s £499 ($USD) price tag.\n\nNothing lifts the lid on plastic cut-price phone\n\nDuring an awkward presentation, in which cofounder Akis Evangelidis stumbled over the pricing of the phone as he tried to market it in three different currencies—U.K. pounds, euros, and Indian rupees—the group unveiled its sleek new smartphone.\n\nIt should be obvious from its £319 ($405 USD) starting price that Nothing’s modus operandi is simplicity at every stage of the user experience, something that filters through to its design.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the latest launch for the Nothing 2(a) event, designers credited Massimo Vignelli, the creator of a simplified iteration of the New York subway map in the 1970s, as their inspiration for taking complex features of a classic smartphone and breaking them down.\n\nThe latest phone is built from recycled plastic and metals, offering a less sleek alternative to the Nothing (2)’s glass and metal exterior.\n\nIts camera sits unusually in the middle of the top of the phone, rather than to the side like its older models and traditional smartphones.\n\nAs with the Nothing Phone (2), the group uses Android’s operating system, Android 14, in its latest model.\n\nNothing boss betting on India\n\nNothing’s CEO Carl Pei has built a reputation as a tech influencer as much as a boss, helping him get on the good side of the traditionally culty tech sector with videos that look like third-party reviews that publicize Nothing’s products.\n\nLast year, Pei even managed to recruit long-running YouTube superstar Casey Neistat to post an in-depth review of last year’s Nothing 2 that involved Pei and Neistat taking the phone on a literal roller coaster ride.\n\nHe will be hoping that recognition can help him take on a Steve Jobs–type cult of personality that could pull curious shoppers to the brand.\n\nIndeed, the group’s choice of India for its launch is likely a sign of its hopes that the cut-price Nothing (2a) model can encroach on Apple’s growing market share in the country.\n\nThe smartphone will begin at a price of £319 for its entry-level 128-gigabyte storage model. A pricier model with 265 GB will be available to U.S. buyers for $349 through a sign-up form on Nothing’s website.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nJim Cramer yet again grilled market naysayers in his latest program on CNBC, calling them “non-believers” who he believes only got encouraged by the recent market declines. Cramer said first the bears warned everyone about the inflationary cycle after the pandemic, then they “hated” the market amid the regional banking crisis, upping their calls for a hard landing following the Fed’s rate hikes.\n\nJim Cramer's Message to the \"Nonbelievers\"\n\nJim Cramer said all along these bears “failed to celebrate the market’s incredible victories” and they “ignored” the “end of high inflation.”\n\nJim Cramer also said that initially the market bears complained about the concentration of market gains in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, which include companies like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), but later ignored when the gains started to “bifurcate” to the broader market including small-cap and mid-cap stocks which Cramer believes are still “cheap.”\n\n“What the heck is wrong with these people,” Cramer said about market skeptics.\n\nIs AI a Bubble? Cramer's Take\n\nJim Cramer also said that while market doubters called AI a bubble, they ignored crypto which Cramer believes was an “obvious bubble.” Cramer said many believe crypto is a hedge against inflation but when inflation was very high crypto performed “horribly.”\n\nNonetheless Cramer admitted that crypto’s “relative worth” against the US dollar is “palpable” and it “makes sense” that people are investing in crypto ETFs to hedge against inflation.\n\nJim Cramer also talked about AI and how some people are calling it a bubble. Cramer said while there are some companies in the industry that are “over inflated” not all AI companies are bubbles. Cramer reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said the stock is undervalued. Cramer said you have to have a historical context to understand and analyze Nvidia. He said that last year NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was apparently overvalued based on the Wall Street’s earnings estimates. Cramer said the company’s 2024 earnings estimates set by Wall Street analysts are still low and that’s why he believes the stock has more room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is undisputed that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the king of AI,” Cramer said.\n\nIn the end, Cramer recommended investors to build up their cash piles and be ready to buy when there’s a pullback. Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Stock Recommendations\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched the latest 'Lightning Round' segments of Jim Cramer's recent programs and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors.

Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nJim Cramer has been bullish on Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) in the past but recently he called the huge runup in the stock price of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) a sign of market “froth.” However, during his latest Lightning Round program on CNBC Cramer recommended investors to buy “some” Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) stock right now and wait for the lockup expiration period to buy some more. Cramer thinks Softbank would sell Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares on lockup expiration and said that would the “best” time to buy the stock.\n\n10.

Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer called Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) a “winner” in one of his latest programs like it was a no-brainer. Cramer said the reason why Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) does not receive a lot of attention is because it’s a “very boring company.” Cramer said this is an inexpensive stock and reiterated that he thinks the stock is a “winner.”\n\nCommercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) shares have gained about 5% in 2024 so far through March 5.\n\nDuring its latest earnings call the company talked about guidance:\n\n\"We expect shipment volumes within our North America Steel Group to decline sequentially due to normal seasonality during the winter months. Margins on steel products are likely to experience some further compression during the second quarter. However, recent price announcements on rebar, merchant bar, and wire rod should support an inflection point in the coming months. Downstream product margins should exhibit good stability sequentially. Conditions in Europe are expected to remain challenging, but adjusted EBITDA excluding energy rebates should improve from the levels of the past two quarters. Financial results for our Emerging Businesses Group are anticipated to follow a typical seasonal pattern with some slowing of activity in Q2.\n\nLooking beyond the second quarter, which is CMC’s seasonally slowest period, we expect robust spring and summer construction activity driven by the increased impact of rising infrastructure investment, which should support an already healthy demand backdrop. Both the North America Steel Group and the Emerging Businesses Group should benefit from anticipated strong activity levels. Regarding the Europe Steel Group, supply-side adjustments and the impact of increasing levels of residential and infrastructure construction should drive sequential improvement in financial results beginning with the spring construction season.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nIn addition to Commercial Metals, Jim Cramer is also bullish on  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Brilliant Buys in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been some of the top performers in the market in recent years. This group consists of some of the largest companies listed in the U.S. markets. They are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOf the seven, I think only four are great buys right now. So, where does the split occur?\n\nI'm not a buyer of these three right now\n\nMicrosoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits.\n\nApple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year.\n\nThese two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.\n\nNvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four.\n\nThese four are much more attractive\n\nThat leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy. For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy.\n\nMeta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point.\n\nLastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.\n\nSome of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough.\n\nBut if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "The United States' economy is consumer-driven: Approximately 68% of America's gross domestic product comes from consumers. That means investors seeking ideas can look for inspiration at the products and services their family and friends use daily.\n\nFamed investor Warren Buffett has made consumer-facing companies a big part of the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company. The following four fantastic stocks make up almost 60% of the entire portfolio.\n\nAs Buffett has done with Berkshire Hathaway, investors can confidently buy and hold these stocks for the long term.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIt's hard to start this list with anything other than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), considering the stock is 44% of Berkshire's entire portfolio. It didn't start that large, but the stock has done very well since Buffett bought it in 2016.\n\nHe has sold very little over the years, letting his winners run instead. Buffett has gone as far as calling the iPhone maker the best business Berkshire owns.\n\nHe has a point. There are more than 2 billion iOS users worldwide, and those customers have proven to be loyal, upgrading their devices and subscribing to billions of dollars' worth of subscription services.\n\nUntil that changes, Apple is poised to generate lots of profit and to continue repurchasing shares and paying dividends.\n\n2. American Express\n\nConsumer spending drives the economy, but consumers don't always spend their cash. Credit cards have become a cultural staple, and American Express(NYSE: AXP) is one of the most recognizable names in the industry.\n\nNot only does American Express lend money to its borrowers, but it's also a payment network, charging merchants on transactions that run on its network. Buffett has owned the stock since the late 1990s, and it's currently 9% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nNotably, American Express' brand power seems to be holding up as spending power transitions from older generations to millennials and Gen Z. Management has stated in recent earnings reports that young users are a rapidly growing customer demographic, setting up the company for years of continued success.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is arguably Buffett's most famous investment. There are countless photos of him enjoying a Coke product over the years.\n\nHe has owned the stock since the late 1990s, and his son even sat on the company's board of directors for several years. Coca-Cola is Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest position at 6.4% of the portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola is a tried-and-true grinder. It sells beverages worldwide, and its steady growth comes from several levers, including population growth, new products, and price increases.\n\nCoke is a legendary dividend stock that has paid and raised its payout annually for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King, true investment royalty that's poised to continue enriching shareholders over the coming decades.\n\n4. Diageo\n\nYou might not recognize Diageo's (NYSE: DEO) corporate name, but if you're 21 or older in the United States, you've probably enjoyed its products. The beverage maker owns several global spirits and alcohol brands, including Guinness Beer, Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray, Baileys, Captain Morgan, and Crown Royal.\n\nDiageo isn't a prominent position for Buffett. At \"only\" $34 million, it's a rounding error in Berkshire's portfolio. He bought the stock early last year, one of Berkshire's most recent adds.\n\nThe company somewhat reminds me of Coca-Cola. It's another slow and steady grinder that holds stellar brand power and pays a dividend. Alcohol is a cultural staple, and many of Diageo's brands go back centuries.\n\nIt's a company you can probably expect to be around 100 years from now, which might be why it appealed to Buffett. It will be interesting to see if he expands his Diageo stake over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds details, background in paragraphs 3-10)\n\nBy Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24% year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint, as the U.S. company faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant's chief competitor in China in premium smartphones, Huawei, saw unit sales rise by 64% in the period, according to the report.\n\nApple's share of the Chinese smartphone market dropped to 15.7%, putting it in fourth place, compared with second place in the same period of 2023 when it accounted for 19% of the market.\n\nHuawei rose to second place as its market share expanded to 16.5% from 9.4% a year earlier.\n\nThe overall smartphone market in China shrank 7%, the report said.\n\nApple \"faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi,” said Counterpoint's senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang.\n\nApple began subsidizing certain iPhone models by as much as 1,300 yuan ($180.68) last week through flagship stores on Tmall, Alibaba's major marketplace platform.\n\nIt had already offered iPhone discounts of up to 500 yuan on its official sites last month.\n\nHuawei has seen a resurgence in its premium smartphone sales since it released its Mate 60 series in August after struggling for years with U.S. restrictions on the exports of key components to the company.\n\nHonor, the smartphone brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, was the only other top-five brand to see unit sales increase during the first six weeks of the year, up 2%. Chinese brands Vivo, Xiaomi and Oppo dropped 15%, 7% and 29% respectively. (Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Kirsten Donovan)",

Momentum is carrying the market and positive thinking is carrying the market.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 97.89 points, or 0.25%, to 38,989.49, the S&P 500 lost 6.09 points, or 0.12%, to 5,130.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 67.27 points, or 0.41%, to 16,207.67.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq had kicked off March by hitting an intraday record high on Friday, also closing at its highest level for two straight days, as the artificial intelligence-driven tech rally continues to steal the spotlight on Wall Street.\n\nThe S&P 500 has also been on a winning streak recently, jumping over 21% with four straight months of gains through February. BofA Global Research lifted its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,400, from 5,000, representing a 5% upside from current levels.\n\nPowell is due to testify before lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday, with analysts assuming the Fed chief to stay in wait-and-watch mode on policy after a recent escalation in inflation.\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer rallied and shoe maker Deckers Outdoor rose ahead of their inclusion in the S&P 500 index.\n\nShares in Macy's jumped after real-estate-focused investing firm Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management raised their offer for the department store chain.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Ankika Biswas and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nJust as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.\n\nApple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\n\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make its last-ditch argument, according to those reports. Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.\n\nThe stock of Apple was down nearly 3% during morning trading, following the decision by the European Commission.\n\nThe EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nThose practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules. EU Commission vice president Margrethe Vestager addresses the media Monday at EU headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.\n\nThrough provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.\n\n\"Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\" the commission said in a summary of its findings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.\n\n\"The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,\" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services. An Apple store in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,\" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.\n\nApple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get \"limitless access\" to Apple's tools, free of charge.\n\nThe US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\nAny DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best consumer electronics stocks. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the consumer electronics industry, head over to 5 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nConsumer electronics are widely used in households, with televisions featuring larger screens gaining popularity, while electrical components are becoming more compact. Companies are focusing on creating high-performance, user-friendly devices to meet the growing demand. This trend, along with technological advancements and digitalization, is expected to drive the demand for electronic items and household appliances. The global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion in 2022, $773.40 billion in 2023, and is projected to grow to $1,239.40 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.97% during the forecast period from 2024-2030, as perFortune Business Insights. The increasing popularity of smart homes is driving the adoption of smart appliances worldwide. These appliances come with features like voice assistance, bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, offering greater convenience. As people's income levels rise, they are investing more in housing and equipping their homes with advanced technological products. The introduction of innovative household products is expected to further boost consumption. Governments worldwide are also supporting the growth of the electronics industry. For example, India aims to reach a $300 billion electronics manufacturing and export market by 2025-26, encouraging the development of technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and machine learning.\n\nAnalysts expect the US consumer electronics industry to rebound in 2024 after two years of decline, as reported by Investor’s Business Daily. The Consumer Technology Association forecasts a 2.8% increase in retail sales, reaching $512 billion this year, compared to a 3.1% decrease to $498 billion in 2023. This turnaround is attributed to a refresh cycle for personal computers, smartphones, and other devices purchased during the COVID crisis. The surge in remote work, distance learning, and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic led to increased purchases of consumer electronics and digital services. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence features is expected to drive upgrades of PCs, smartphones, and other devices in 2024, according to Richard Kowalski, senior director of business intelligence for the CTA. He commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“AI is already incorporated in many devices and services. Think about the natural language processing in our digital assistants, computer vision in our vehicle safety systems and health tracking algorithms in our smartwatches.”\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 contributed to consumer awareness and interest in generative AI, as per Brian Comiskey, CTA's director of thematic programs. Comiskey anticipates augmented reality and virtual reality headsets to be growth drivers in consumer electronics this year. The Consumer Technology Association predicts that consumer software and services revenue will outpace hardware sales, growing by 3.8% to $163 billion. This segment is led by entertainment software and services, including audio, video, and gaming. On the other hand, consumer electronics hardware sales are expected to increase by 2.3% to $349 billion, reversing a 5.4% decline in 2023.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show 2024 was a showcase of cutting-edge technology and a glimpse into the future of tech. According to Forbes, Artificial intelligence and machine learning took the spotlight, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introducing new GenAI-powered Alexa experiences. Intuition Robotics unveiled a more advanced version of its eldercare robot, ElliQ, using AI to engage elderly users in activities that promote cognitive and social wellness. LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LPL) showcased a smart home robot with two-legged mobility and user recognition, integrating seamlessly with smart appliances. Healthcare technology featured the Motion Pillow by Motionsleep, which uses AI to detect snoring and adjust head position, improving sleep quality. In entertainment, ultra-high-definition displays and immersive audio systems offered cinematic experiences at home. LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LPL) launched the Signature OLED T 4K transparent wireless TV, along with innovative kitchen appliances, pet tech, and laptops, highlighting the diverse applications of technology. CES 2024 showcased the rapid evolution of consumer electronics and technology.\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best consumer electronics stocks to buy, which include Apple Inc.

They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.”\n\n6. GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\n\nGoPro, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GPRO), compared to 19 funds in the last quarter. D E Shaw held a significant position in the company, comprising 3.6 million shares valued at $12.51 million.\n\nLike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) is one of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy. It ranks 6th on our list.\n\nHere is what Roubaix Capital has to say about GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:\n\n“Companies like GoPro (GPRO) should benefit from the consumer rebound, but also have their own unique drivers of value over the next 2+ years. In the case of GPRO, the company launched its newest action camera, the GoPro9, under the umbrella of a new business model. The company offers a discount on the camera when customers purchase a subscription agreement that comes with additional services and benefits. The uptake of the subscription has been strong to date and offers the company a line of sight to a higher margin and more predictable revenue stream. The stock’s low double digit earnings multiple remains undemanding. We have seen this type of transformation play out in numerous situations in software, hardware and even retail companies such as RH. We see GPRO following suit and expect a return to travel later this year to be another reason for consumers to buy a new camera as they head back out on vacation.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States That Don’t Tax Retirement Pension Payouts 12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour 25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Retail, known for its consistent growth, is one of the best markets for long-term investment. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. The global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed immense success in the industry, with leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, Apple has the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite having a significantly smaller product range than its rivals.\n\nHowever, it's hard to consider Apple's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) also exists. The company is the world's second-biggest retailer (only after Walmart) and is the No. 1 name in e-commerce. Additionally, Amazon's diverse business model has seen it gain a powerful position in tech, with a leading 31% market share in the $626 billion cloud market. AMZN Chart\n\nThis chart shows Amazon's stock significantly outperforming Apple's over the last year. Meanwhile, various growth catalysts in retail and tech will likely keep the company on its current trajectory.\n\nSo forget Apple and buy this unstoppable growth stock instead.\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive turnaround\n\nAn economic downturn caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% in 2022. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery since then, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\n\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and its free cash flow skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple didn't fare as well amid macroeconomic headwinds, with its revenue dipping 3% to $383 billion in fiscal 2023, while its free cash flow rose 10%.\n\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. The retail giant has shown it can successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds, making its shares an attractive long-term buy. Meanwhile, its considerable cash reserves indicate it has the financial resources to continue expanding and investing in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon stock could enjoy nearly 70% upside in the near future\n\nIn dozens of countries, Amazon dominates e-commerce, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2028. The tech company will likely continue profiting from the sector's tailwinds for years.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.\n\nMoreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to expand at a CAGR of 37% through 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nAmazon has entered the market by adding a range of AI tools to AWS and unveiling a new AI shopping assistant called Rufus on its retail site.\n\nThe tech giant is on an exciting growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflect it has significantly more potential than Apple. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon's EPS could hit nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Apple's may reach close to $8 per share. When multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 42 and Apple's 28), you get a stock price of $294 for Amazon and $218 for Apple.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Amazon's share price rise 68% and Apple's 20% by fiscal 2026. Combined with a reliable business model and solid positions in e-commerce and AI, Amazon is a no-brainer growth stock to buy over Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Tech giant Apple has been fined 1.8 billion euros (£1.5 billion) by regulators in Europe for not allowing music streaming apps like Spotify to tell customers they can subscribe for cheaper if they do not use Apple’s App Store.\n\nThe European Commission said that Apple had abused its dominant position in the market for distributing music streaming apps, and had broken EU antitrust rules in the process. Apple said it would appeal the decision.\n\nThe iPhone-maker said: “The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast.”\n\nSwedish music giant Spotify filed a complaint to the EU in 2019 which claimed that Apple limits choice and competition by charging a 30% fee on purchases made through the App Store.\n\nSpotify called this an unfair “tax” which benefits Apple Music, the tech giant’s own music platform which does not get charged the same fees.\n\nSpotify also said that it is not allowed to tell customers there are cheaper ways to subscribe outside the App Store.\n\nApple said that it had a “key role supporting Spotify’s success” over the years.\n\n“We’ve even flown our engineers to Stockholm to help Spotify’s teams in person,” it said.\n\nBut the European Commission appeared to agree with Spotify on Monday saying: “Apple bans music streaming app developers from fully informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app and from providing any instructions about how to subscribe to such offers.”\n\nThis could “negatively affect the interests of iOS users,” who will not be able to make informed decisions and may paid “significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions”.\n\nCompetition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: “For a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store.\n\nStory continues\n\n“They did so by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem.\n\n“This is illegal under EU antitrust rules, so today we have fined Apple over 1.8 billion euros.”\n\nApple said: “Apple has been a part of Europe for over 40 years, and today, we support more than 2.5 million jobs across the continent.\n\n“We’ve helped markets thrive, promoting competition and innovation at every turn — and the App Store is an important part of that story.\n\n“So while we respect the European Commission, the facts simply don’t support this decision. And as a result, Apple will appeal.”",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Tuesday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for breaking the bloc's competition laws by unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over rivals.\n\nApple banned app developers from \"fully informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services outside of the app,\" said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer.\n\nThat is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Apple behaved this way for almost a decade, which meant many users paid “significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions,” the commission said.\n\nThe 1.8 billion-euro fine follows a long-running investigation triggered by a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five years ago.\n\nThe EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including a series of multbillion-dollar fines for Google and charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market. The commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple's mobile payments service.\n\nThe commission's investigation initially centered on two concerns. One was the iPhone maker's practice of forcing app developers that are selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.\n\nBut the EU later dropped that to focus on how Apple prevents app makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app.\n\nThe investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their apps, including links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options.\n\nThe fine comes the same week that new EU rules are set to kick in that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set of do's and don'ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of hefty fines.\n\nThe DMA's provisions are designed to prevent tech giants from the sort of behavior that's at the heart of the Apple investigation. Apple has already revealed how it will comply, including allowing iPhone users in Europe to use app stores other than its own and enabling developers to offer alternative payment systems.\n\nThe commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple’s mobile payments service, and the company has promised to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals in order to resolve it.",

        "title": "Qualcomm Stock Is No Nvidia, But It’s Still a Buy",
        "content": "There’s no denying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the premier artificial intelligence (AI) stock. Trading just under $2 trillion, NVDA stock is worth more than the next five chipmakers combined. Over the past decade, an investment in the graphics processing units (GPU) maker returned almost 10 times more than the S&P 500. It doesn’t appear there is any letup in Nvidia’s growth either. Shares are up 60% in 2024 and we’re only two months into the year. The funny thing is, as recently as 2019 industry peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was worth more than its rival. QCOM stock had a $93 billion market capitalization compared to $86 billion for Nvidia. Of course, today the tables are reversed and QCOM stock hasn’t even doubled in value whereas NVDA is up 23-fold.\n\nThe divergence can be laid at the business choices they made. Qualcomm focused primarily on chips for smartphones while Nvidia, well, history shows where it went. Gaming GPUs turned into bitcoin mining and then to data centers and today into artificial intelligence. At each phase, the complex and demanding needs of the sector were met by Nvidia’s advanced chips.\n\nWhile Qualcomm may be a good investment (it is), can it ever hope to catch up to its rival ever again?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTough comparisons\n\nQualcomm reported strong fiscal first quarter results last month. Revenue rose 5% to $9.9 billion primarily due to 16% growth in its handset chip business. Sales there hit $6.7 billion. Computer chips for automobiles grew nearly twice as fast but it is Qualcomm’s smallest business with just $598 million in sales. The Internet of Things business suffered a 32% decline in sales to $1.1 billion.\n\nA few weeks later, Nvidia reported its own earnings and it’s a tough comparison for Qualcomm. For example, Nvidia’s data center business alone doubled Qualcomm’s entire sales effort as segment revenue surged 409% year over year. You can’t call Nvidia’s gaming revenue de minimis at $2.9 billion but it pales in comparison to data centers. Qualcomm’s operating earnings were a hefty $3 billion but they still fell well short of its rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is already clear the smartphone chipmaker has little chance of ever catching up to Nvidia. Unless there is some cataclysmic event that causes data centers and AI to crash and burn, Nvidia’s lead atop the chip market is fully sealed.\n\nBetter value but not a better opportunity\n\nYet don’t ignore the opportunity that QCOM stock represents. It has a somewhat better valuation profile than its rival. Qualcomm trades for just 14 times next year’s earnings estimates and 17 times the free cash flow (FCF) it produces versus 27 and 73 times, respectively, for Nvidia. Qualcomm is not sporting bargain-basement valuations but they are more attractive.\n\nYet that could be because Nvidia is expected to grow earnings at a 36% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) while Qualcomm’s earnings CAGR is just 8%. Solid but not earth-shaking. That’s because the market believes this AI boom is going to go on for an extended period while the smartphone upgrade cycle tends to be cyclical.\n\nThe winding down of Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 ramp weighed on Qualcomm’s performance but that is expected to change soon. Samsung with its Galaxy S24 smartphone should provide the next large ramp higher for the smartphone chipmaker as well as the ongoing recovery in China’s Android market. The automotive market is also picking up while its licensing business is supremely profitable.\n\nStill a good stock\n\nQualcomm won’t — and can’t — replace Nvidia though as a more reasonably priced stock it still represents a good, long-term investment. There are many paths to a profit and not everyone will be the whirlwind adventure Nvidia is. But you shouldn’t compare such singular events to the wider universe of stocks. QCOM stock is a solid company in its own right and should be seen on its own merits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four linchpins of Berkshire Hathaway’s business.\n\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap\n\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple’s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\n\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It’s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\n\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It’s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple’s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\n\nStory continues\n\nCriteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock\n\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\n\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\n\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”\n\nAlphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\n\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\n\nWill Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best single digit stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our coverage of affordable stocks and how they, like all other stocks such as small cap and large cap stocks, benefit and suffer from the broader macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In.\n\nStocks can broadly be classified into three categories based on their market capitalization. Each of these represents firms whose shares operate with different dynamics within the broader market climate. The three primary stock categories are small, mid, and large caps, with the passage of time that has seen trillion dollar valuations the likes of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also created new categories commonly called mega cap stocks.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of computing products across the financial industry has made stock trading easier, leading to thousands of firms in categories such as micro and nano cap stocks. These stocks, which include firms whose shares trade in the single digits, are on the more 'affordable' end of the spectrum in literal terms. Single digit stocks are a small upgrade over the broader category of well known stocks that are called penny stocks. Typically, these stocks refer to firms whose shares trade below $5, and when we consider the general benefits and drawbacks of investing, single digit stocks, and penny stocks follow the same rules.\n\nBoth offer a higher potential for larger percentage returns via share price appreciation. Similarly, since penny stocks and single digit stocks belong to companies that receive little media coverage, the potential of scammers exploiting unwitting investors is high. This is because during the initial stage of a 'pump' during a typical scam, the shares of a single digit or penny stock appreciate much faster than the media can respond to determine if the performance is driven by underlying fundamentals or other legitimate tailwinds. Then, as more investors pile on, should the price drop, then most people end up losing their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, where there's risk there's a reward, and one key advantage that single digit stocks have over penny stocks is that since they also include firms whose shares trade between $5 and $10, the opportunities from profiting also increase with the growing comfort of a heftier share price. Additionally, another key benefit that is rather exclusive to single digit stocks is that they can often involve the shares of well established and sizeable foreign entities who also make their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) available for trading on American stock markets.\n\nThis trend is present predominantly in the banking sector, with foreign or ex-US banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG), and Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN) being apt examples. Each of these is a major player in the financial systems of their countries, with a role similar to U.S. banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\nTherefore, investing in single digit stocks offers a chance of stability as well as profit taking. Continuing with our example of single digit banking stocks, MUFJ's shares are up by a respectable 16% year to date, despite the fact that Japan's economy, like other developed peers such as the United Kingdom and Germany, is not performing well. Similarly, even though Britain is officially in recession territory, Lloyd's stock has shed just 6% over the past twelve months and had the shares not dropped in January, then just like the British economy, the stock would also be nearly flat in growth terms.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best single digit stocks, it's important to also keep in mind recent stock market and economic news. With NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s blockbuster earnings out of the way, investors will now focus on interest rates and U.S. GDP growth - both of which are quite interlinked. Starting with the latter, S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), ahead of its flagship S&P 500 crossing the coveted 5,000 point barrier and setting a new record, also upgraded its forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2024. The ratings agency now believes that the American economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, for a significant upward revision over the previous estimate of 1.5%. As this would hint on its own, the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes also show that the central bank is worried about cutting rates too soon rather than too late.\n\nSo, with single digit stocks offering the promise of returns and stability, we decided to look at what stocks hedge funds are buying. Some notable picks are Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG). 12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close up of hands counting a vast stack of money in a bank vault.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best single digit stocks to buy, we ranked the 60 most valuable single digit stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of December 2023. Out of these, the single digit stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best single digit stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\n12. Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 32\n\nGarrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) is an American car parts manufacturer that sells performance products like turbos for cars and air compressors for industrial use.

The largest Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)  shareholder in our database is Howard Marks's Oaktree Capital Management courtesy of its $426 million stake.\n\nAlong with, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MQ)'s top line to grow by 20%.\n\nBy the end of 2023's December quarter, 32 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Marqeta, Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ).

(NASDAQ:NWL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 33\n\nNewell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) is a diversified consumer goods firm that sells products like coffee and cleaning items. Unlike Marqeta, whose shares soared in 2024, Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL)'s fell to record lows in February 2024 after its full year earnings guidance disappointed investors.\n\nAs of December 2023 end, 33 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had held a stake in the firm.

Leonard Green's Leonard Green & Partners was the biggest investor since it owned $1 billion worth of shares.\n\n8. BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 34\n\nBGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC) is an American brokerage that deals in a wide variety of investment products and securities. It's one of the more interesting stocks on our list of the best single digit stocks since while the shares soared after BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC) announced record earnings results in February 2024, they ended up reversing all the gains a week later.\n\nDuring December 2023, 34 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research held a stake in BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC).\n\n7. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 36\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) is a Canadian gold company with operations in the U.S., Canada, and other countries.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was removed from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s list of top buys after underperformance in its stock amid concerns over weak demand for its key products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a Dive BofA’s Subramanian Is Latest on Wall Street to Boost S&P 500 Target Haley Casts Doubt on Nominee Pledge After Trump’s Power Play Crafts Retailer Joann Is Planning a Bankruptcy Filing That Would Hand Keys to Lenders Fed’s Powell to Double Down on ‘No Rush to Cut’ Message\n\nThe iPhone maker had ranked in the 20-25 member “Directors’ Cut” version of Goldman’s conviction list since it was unveiled last June. Its share price is little changed in that span while the S&P 500 Index has jumped almost 22%. Apple dropped 0.6% Friday after its removal from the list.\n\nApple has lagged its Magnificent 7 peers even more dramatically, trailing all but Tesla Inc. Concerns of a prolonged iPhone sales slump have been the main culprit, particularly as China’s economic troubles continue.\n\nGoldman said its Directors’ Cut list is reviewed monthly, with stocks being removed if they are “no longer a top investment idea”. Analyst Michael Ng maintains a buy rating on Apple on the belief that “the market’s focus on slower product revenue growth masks the strength of the Apple ecosystem and associated revenue durability & visibility,” the broker’s report said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Robotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best battery stocks to invest in before they take off. If you want to skip our covrerage of all the latest developments in the battery and electric vehicle industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off.\n\nThe global battery industry, 'powered' by lithium is significantly more important in 2024 than it was in 2014. This is because of the success of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in successfully executing electric vehicle mass production has demonstrated to investors that investing in clean energy stocks can yield favorable results and that electric vehicles have the full potential of being a reality instead of something only in the realm of science fiction.\n\nYet, just as they do on a smartphone or a laptop, batteries also remain one of the weakest links of modern day electric cars. Smartphones, even those from the multi trillion dollar consumer technology behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), see their batteries degrade over time, even as their other components such as the display or processors are able to perform for years. Similarly, the battery of an electric car made by Tesla or other electric vehicle stocks such as Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) is not only one of the most vulnerable components of a car but also one that can be in short supply if there are any fluctuations in the global lithium industry.\n\nNaturally, this means that the global battery industry is not only one of the most valuable in the world but also that it has steady growth ahead of it should the world's plans to phase out internal combustion vehicles bear fruit. Estimates show that the global lithium battery industry was worth $54 billion in 2023, but global macroeconomic troubles left in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic have also shaken up the sector by quite a bit. While previously investors of battery stocks had to keep a close eye on China to ensure that the supply chain of their industry was functioning smoothly, as of February 2024, Canada was the world's preeminent battery supply chain according to Bloomberg's data. This is the first time in history that China has been displaced from the top spot, and it follows a growing global shift towards sustainable and ethical battery sourcing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat does this mean for battery stocks? Well, this is good news for battery stocks that trade in U.S. exchanges in particular, since not only will American automakers be able to rely on Canada for their battery needs, but tax credit incentives under the Biden-Harris Administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) might also extend to batteries and materials sourced from Canada.\n\nHowever, even though Canada's rising prominence in the global lithium battery supply chain is a tailwind for battery stocks, they have also entered 2024 on an unstable footing. Their primary high growth market, i.e. electric vehicles, has struggled to operate in a high interest rate and inflation era, so much so that the fourth quarter of 2024 saw electric vehicle king Tesla displaced by the Chinese conglomerate BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF). Tesla's Q4 2023 deliveries stood at 484,507 vehicles, while BYD was able to clock 526,409 in sales for its cheaper electric cars. The duo's tryst is a great example of the cutthroat Chinese market which has seen Tesla and BYD reduce their prices and sacrifice margins to gain market share even if their products make fewer cents on the dollar.\n\nThis turmoil in the electric vehicle industry is also present in the global lithium market. Lithium and battery stocks such as Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) are down by 31% and 19.29% respectively as lithium prices drop by more than 70% on the back of the simultaneous effects of softer demand and rising supply. The lithium and battery stock price drops come just as U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) might also become a battery stock as it is interested in extracting lithium in Arkansas as part of its bid to become one of the world's biggest lithium suppliers by the end of the decade.\n\nSo, as the global battery industry starts to evolve in 2024 and respond to changing macroeconomic conditions, we decided to see which battery stocks are finding favor from hedge funds. Some notable picks are EnerSys (NYSE:ENS), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). 12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off\n\nA close-up of a lithium-ion battery surrounded by a network of silicon nanowires.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best battery stocks to buy, we ranked the U.S. listed battery stock holdings of the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF, and Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF by their year to date share price performance. Then, the stocks that were down year to date were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and the top stocks were selected as the best battery stocks.\n\nFor these best battery stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off\n\n12. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.

        "title": "Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $10,000 in Apple Stock When Warren Buffett First Bought It",
        "content": "Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was a \"better business than any we own.\" And he has put his money where his mouth is through the years.\n\nApple ranks as Berkshire's biggest holding by far. It makes up a whopping 44.3% of the conglomerate's portfolio. Like many investors, Buffett has made a lot of money from his investment in the technology giant. Here's how much you'd have if you invested $10,000 in Apple stock when Warren Buffett first bought it.\n\nBuffett's Apple-buying spree\n\nBerkshire first initiated a position in Apple in the first quarter of 2016. Buffett and his team at first bought roughly 39.2 million shares of Apple.\n\nThe buying continued into the second quarter of 2016. Berkshire increased its stake in Apple by more than 55%. After remaining on the sidelines in the next quarter, Buffett accelerated things considerably in Q4, boosting Berkshire's position in Apple by nearly 277%.\n\nDuring 2017, Buffett scooped up more shares of Apple in each quarter. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned close to 162.6 million shares of the iPhone maker.\n\nAlthough Buffett kept on buying more Apple stock into the third quarter of 2018, he slammed on the brakes near the end of the year and trimmed Berkshire's position by 1.1%. The legendary investor also sold relatively small amounts of the stock in 2019 and 2020.\n\nBuffett returned to buying Apple again in 2022, adding incremental shares in three of the four quarters that year. He also bought more shares in 2023 Q1. However, Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple by a little over 1% in 2023 Q4. Today, Berkshire owns nearly 905.6 million shares.\n\nWhat a $10,000 investment in Apple then would be worth now\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple is now worth nearly $164.3 billion. Of course, the conglomerate invested billions of dollars in the stock over the last eight years. If you had invested $10,000 in Apple when Buffett first bought it, you'd have much less but would have still enjoyed a tremendous return.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe don't know exactly what price Buffett paid for Apple back in the first quarter of 2016. Let's assume, though, that he bought the shares at the highest closing price of $27.39 during the period, to be conservative. (Note: This price is adjusted for splits. Apple conducted a 4-for-1 stock split on Aug. 28, 2020.)\n\nIf you bought $10,000 worth of Apple shares at that price and didn't sell any shares along the way, your investment would today be worth close to $66,250. At the stock's peak in late December 2023, your shares would have been worth a little over $71,000. AAPL Chart\n\nNote, however, that this total doesn't include reinvesting dividends. Apple paid dividends of at least $0.205 (on a split-adjusted basis) every quarter. Your total amount would have been even greater had you reinvested those dividends.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nCould you grow an initial $10,000 investment by more than 6.6 times over the next eight years with Apple? Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. Two primary factors would make such a return difficult.\n\nFirst, Apple's growth rate is slowing quite a bit. In the company's latest quarter, for example, revenue increased by only 2% year over year. Although Apple's services business continues to deliver solid growth, product sales continue to generate more than four-fifths of total sales.\n\nSecond, Apple's valuation is now high. Shares trade at 28 times forward earnings. That's an especially steep forward-earnings multiple for a company that isn't growing revenue rapidly.\n\nApple arguably remains the best business that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns. However, at least for now, it's probably not the best stock in Buffett's portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Since March 1, 2021, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares have climbed almost 50%. That gain is more than double the increase in the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same period. And it continues an impressive track record of this tech behemoth outpacing the broader market.\n\nEven today, Apple shares aren't too far off their all-time high, as the artificial intelligence (AI) craze is still in full effect. But investors have their sights on the longer term.\n\nWhere will this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock be in three years?\n\nStill a hardware company at heart\n\nLaunched in 2007 for the first time, the iPhone is the single product that made Apple the global cultural and business icon that it is today. We're 17 years past that point, and the popular smartphone still generated 52% of the company's 2023 revenue. At the end of the day, Apple is still an iPhone business.\n\nOf course, numerous other products are offered, like the iPad tablets and MacBook laptops, as well as the Watch and AirPods. Combined, hardware accounted for 78% of fiscal 2023's revenues. But it's not a big growth driver anymore, as that sales figure was down 6% compared to the year before.\n\nA finger can be pointed to the current macroeconomic climate, as higher interest rates and worries about a recession might discourage consumers from spending more on discretionary purchases. And the fact that newer devices have fewer game-changing updates makes it easy to delay buying the latest product introduction.\n\nSome Apple supporters might have hoped that the business would stay on course with its plan to launch an autonomous vehicle. However, this project was recently scratched. The global car market is a massive industry that could've moved the financial needle for Apple, but I guess we'll never know what could've been.\n\nIf we look to 2027, there's no question in my mind, though, that the iPhone will remain Apple's bread and butter.\n\nA growing business line\n\nAstute readers will quickly realize that there's another part of the Apple empire that is quickly ascending to become more important. I'm talking about services and subscriptions, including services like iCloud, Pay, Card, TV+, Fitness+, and Music. This segment raked in $23 billion of sales in the latest fiscal quarter (the first quarter of 2024 ended Dec. 30), up 11% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile still a small part of the business, services have greater growth potential than hardware. And they are far more profitable, carrying a stellar gross margin of 73%.\n\nFrom a purely competitive standpoint, services are what create the dominant Apple ecosystem. The business has 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, a number that gets larger with each passing quarter. This helps drive more and more of the high-margin and recurring revenue that comes from services and subscriptions. And it keeps consumers engaged and loyal.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I still expect products, particularly the iPhone, to carry the weight three years from now. But this up-and-coming segment shouldn't be ignored.\n\nGetting in the way of outsized returns\n\nIn order to become one of the world's most valuable corporations, it's not surprising that a business has to be kind to its shareholders. And Apple is no exception. The stock is a huge winner, likely making many millionaires over the years.\n\nHowever, if we view things with a fresh perspective today, shares aren't cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2. That's a sizable premium to its trailing 10-year average. This indicates the optimism that Apple investors have.\n\nIf Apple was staring at a significant growth opportunity in the years ahead, that valuation might make sense. This just isn't the case. Consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at an annualized clip of 4% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026.\n\nConsequently, there's a good chance the stock will underperform the Nasdaq Composite Index over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "From artificial intelligence to renewed excitement in cryptocurrencies, there are a lot of phenomenal growth stories driving markets right now.\n\nBut as Warren Buffett just wrote in his 2023 annual letter to shareholders -- \"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\"\n\nThis word of caution doesn't mean that the factors driving the market are all wrong. It's just that when it comes to investing, it's vital to avoid hopping on a popular trade to make a quick buck. In the long run, a better approach is to focus on owning a piece of a quality business that can grow in value over time.\n\nHere's why Lululemon(NASDAQ: LULU), Moderna(NASDAQ: MRNA), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Ford (NYSE: F), and Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) have what it takes to compound, and why each stock is worth buying in March. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStretch into the spring\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Lululemon Athletica): Lululemon Athletica will announce its official fourth-quarter earnings update sometime in March, but investors don't have to wait until then to buy this stellar growth stock. The athleisure giant already offered some tantalizing hints about its growth trends to close out fiscal 2023, saying in early January that both sales and profits will land ahead of management's previous forecast. \"We are pleased with our performance during the holiday season,\" CFO Megan Frank said in a press release.\n\nExecutives are now calling for Q4 sales to rise by about 14%, translating into a nearly 20% spike for the full year. For context, most Wall Street pros are looking for Nike to grow by just about 1% in 2024.\n\nLululemon is also stretching higher with respect to profit margins, meaning investors can expect to see much higher annual earnings over time. Gross profit margin is near 60% of sales, and operating profit has been holding above 20% of sales for the past two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the downside, shares don't appear cheap heading into the March earnings update. You'll have to pay nearly 7 times annual sales for Lululemon's business, while you could own Nike for half that premium. There's a good chance Lululemon will earn its higher valuation by continuing to report fast growth and rising profits in 2024 and beyond. Those sales gains should come from its push into international markets and to demographics outside of its core female audience. Look for a steady flow of innovative product releases to support higher margins over time.\n\nIf you're risk-averse, you might want to just watch the stock for a potentially lower price to arrive. Yet Lululemon still looks attractive heading into the spring shopping season.\n\nIt's time to give this biotech stock another shot\n\nKeith Speights (Moderna): Let me acknowledge right out of the gate that Moderna doesn't look like a promising pick at first glance. Shares of the biotech company have plunged 80% below the peak set in mid-2021 and have fallen close to 30% over the last 12 months. Moderna's revenue continues to sink due to declining demand for its COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHowever, I think it's time to give this biotech stock another shot (pun fully intended). Why? Moderna appears to be on the threshold of a major comeback.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a PDUFA date of May 12, 2024, for an approval decision on Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine mRNA-1345. This RSV vaccine should be a commercial success if approved, considering its solid efficacy and pre-filled syringes, which save doctors and pharmacists time.\n\nModerna also hopes to launch mRNA-1345 in Australia and Germany later this year. It plans to expand into additional markets in 2025.\n\nThanks largely to the anticipated boost from its new RSV vaccine, Moderna thinks it will return to sales growth next year. The company expects to reach breakeven in 2026. But mRNA-1345 isn't the only potential growth driver on the way.\n\nModerna intends to file for regulatory approvals of its seasonal flu vaccine mRNA-1010 this year as well. Its pipeline features several other late-stage programs, too, including a combination flu/COVID-19 vaccine, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that's refrigerator-stable, cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine mRNA-1647, and cancer vaccine mRNA-4157. Moderna is partnering with Merck to test mRNA-4157 with blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda in treating melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\nI predict Moderna will make much more money by the end of this decade than it does now and be highly profitable. For long-term investors looking for a great turnaround story, this biotech stock could be right up their alley.\n\nApple's best qualities are underappreciated by the market right now\n\nDaniel Foelber (Apple): The simplest reason to buy Apple stock is that it is an above-average company trading at nearly the same valuation as the S&P 500. That's a 27.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the index and 28 for Apple.\n\nThere are a few reasons why Apple isn't getting the same market premium as other tech stocks. The simplest is its near-term growth prospects. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nAs you can see in the chart, the forward P/E ratios of some of the higher-flying big-tech-related stocks are significantly lower than the current P/E. In Nvidia's extreme case, earnings are expected to double in a single year, which is why the forward P/E is about half of the current P/E. With Apple, the two metrics are almost identical.\n\nIf you're a short-term trader, there's no reason to buy Apple stock now. And it's important to remember that stock prices can take wild swings based on sentiment and emotion.\n\nBut if you're a long-term investor, which is a far more successful method for compounding wealth over time, there's a lot to like about Apple that the market may be discounting right now.\n\nIts recent quarter featured slowing growth in China, which is concerning. But North America, emerging markets like India and South Korea, and other parts of the world are doing well. Apple's high-margin services segment continues to be a key part of the long-term growth story.\n\nApple also has very little debt net of cash relative to its size. And it generates plenty more money than it needs to run the business. This is a company that bought back over $20 billion of its own stock last quarter. On average, that's over $222 million spent on stock buybacks per day!\n\nThere are very few companies out there with that level of financial muscle to deploy at will.\n\nApple is a phenomenal business with a powerful brand, streamlined vertical integration, a rock-solid balance sheet, and plenty of capital it can use to accelerate growth if it wants to. The valuation makes sense relative to the market, and that's why Apple is worth buying in March.\n\nFord is a no-brainer stock to buy now\n\nNeha Chamaria(Ford Motor): After a pretty volatile 2023, Ford stock has picked up some slack lately, rallying nearly 18% in the past three months, as of this writing. Labor strikes, rising costs, high interest rates, and an electric vehicle (EV) business losing billions of dollars even as fears of a global industry slowdown loom large were some of the bigger reasons why investors stayed on the sidelines on Ford stock last year. As it turns out, the latest developments at Ford have renewed investors' faith in the legacy automaker, and I believe this is a great time to buy the stock for the long haul.\n\nDespite all the challenges, Ford grew its revenue by 11% in 2023 and turned a net profit of $4.3 billion, versus a net loss of $2 billion in 2022. Ford also declared a supplemental dividend for the first quarter as its adjusted free cash flow of $6.8 billion surpassed targets.\n\nEven so, CEO Jim Farley emphasized how Ford is \"nowhere near\" its earnings potential yet, and he believes the company is well-positioned for growth this year. One of the key drivers should be Ford Pro, the company's commercial vehicles division, which generates substantial recurring revenue from hardware, software, and services businesses. In 2024, Ford expects Ford Pro to generate the highest earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of around $8 billion to $9 billion among all its three divisions, with Ford Blue -- its gas-and-hybrid vehicles segment -- coming in a close second. Its EV business, Model e, could lose as much as $5.5 billion in EBIT in 2024.\n\nFord knows EVs are a challenging market, so it now wants to cut down capital spending on EVs until the time is right and focus instead on the higher-margin Pro and Blue businesses. This move alone reflects Ford's agility, and it is commendable that the company is still projecting flat to 15% growth in adjusted EBIT this year despite the massive expected losses in EVs. So Ford continues to grow despite challenges and is making the right moves to boost its earnings, making it a great stock to buy now for 2024 and beyond.\n\nWhy Roku's recent stock drop signals buying the stock in March\n\nAnders Bylund (Roku): Roku's recent stock drop is an inviting investment opportunity in my eyes.\n\nThe media-streaming technology expert's fourth-quarter earnings report inspired a 24% stock price drop the next day and a 33% decline three days later. Market reactions like these usually follow a disappointing earnings report with weak results and a gloomy near-term market view. But none of those bearish components showed up in Roku's report.\n\nThe headline results were roughly in line with Wall Street's consensus estimates, with a 2% upside surprise on the top line. But the crucial category of ad buyers in the media and entertainment (A&E) industry is not springing back to generous marketing campaigns, limiting Roku's growth prospects over the next quarter or two.\n\nThen Walmart threw more cold water on Roku's stock chart with the acquisition of smart TV buyer Vizio. If that deal is approved and completed, it'll take away an important software customer from Roku's roster and boost Vizio's business prospects with a deep-pocketed parent company. So Roku's stock took another dive as investors absorbed the implications of a Walmart-Vizio combination.\n\nBut Roku's bears are jumping to the wrong conclusions.\n\nYou see, Roku's modest revenue growth and negative earnings in recent quarters resulted from management's calculated choices. While other media-streaming hardware and software providers battled the inflation crisis by raising their prices, Roku held its price tags steady to attract more users instead.\n\nSo the user count grew from 60 million to 80 million active customers in two years, knee-deep in the inflation bog. Using cheap hardware as a loss-leader marketing trick worked wonders, and I think it's a smart investment. Sustained earnings can wait, as long as Roku is focused on building the largest possible user base for a lucrative long-term future.\n\nLong story short, I found Roku's fourth-quarter report inspiring, and the price drop that followed simply opened the buying window a little bit wider. As for the Walmart plus Vizio threat, Roku is no stranger to tackling larger and richer rivals. Meanwhile, connected TV security expert Pixalate reports that Roku's share of the ad market on North American smart TVs rose from 50% in February 2023 to 55% one year later. It's not even a close race.\n\nSo I bought more Roku shares after the price drops in February and might come back again in March. Do your own research and see where you stand on this stock's bull-to-bear scale -- but the time to act is now if you agree with my analysis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Are Warren Buffett's Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Picks",
        "content": "Famed investor Warren Buffett isn't known as a technology guru; his reputation comes from opportunistically buying and holding longtime blue chip stocks in Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company, which is worth nearly a trillion dollars today.\n\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is sneakily invested very heavily, I might add, in artificial intelligence (AI). The top four AI stocks by position size represent nearly half the total portfolio!\n\nSo, feast your eyes on Buffett's top four AI stocks:\n\n1. Apple\n\nWarren Buffett isn't afraid to let a winning investment become a large piece of Berkshire's portfolio. Look no further than iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The stock, which Buffett first bought in 2016, has grown to 44.2% of the portfolio. Nonetheless, Apple is a bonafide AI stock, and Buffett has only sold minimal shares despite sitting on tremendous unrealized gains today. Why? Buffett has credited fierce customer loyalty, quipping that people would give up their second car for an iPhone.\n\nTech companies, Apple included, are investing in AI and combining it with their consumer-facing products. Apple has already implemented AI into the iOS experience for creature comforts, like Siri assistance, facial recognition, content recommendations, and more. However, Tim Cook recently shared at an event that Apple is prioritizing investments in generative AI. It recently shut down its electric car project and will shift employee resources to Apple's AI division. Buckle up for the future.\n\n2. Moody's\n\nCorporate credit and analytics firm Moody's(NYSE: MCO) is more similar to Buffett's known style. Berkshire has owned Moody's stock since 2000, and it has been a very successful investment over the years. It's a much smaller piece of Berkshire's portfolio at 2.5%, but then again, Moody's is a much smaller company than Apple. Berkshire's stake represents 13.5% ownership in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoody's analyzes data to rate corporate credit and sell market research. Artificial intelligence is a natural progression for a company like Moody's. The business possesses invaluable data from decades of operations and uses OpenAI and Azure to build models for that data. Moody's evolution to more tech-driven data analytics is critical to maintaining its stellar reputation in the financial markets. Moody's has grown revenue for 64 consecutive quarters, a testament to the company's durability.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nTech giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock Buffett got into late; he didn't add shares to Berkshire's portfolio until 2019. However, the stock has more than doubled since then, showing that it's hardly ever too late to invest in great businesses. Amazon has built a reputation as an innovator. After becoming the dominant e-commerce company in America, Amazon has since built a leading cloud platform and streaming service and is now leaning into AI.\n\nLike Apple, Amazon is using generative AI in its consumer-facing businesses. E-commerce customers can view a product, and AI will summarize buyers' product reviews into shortened summaries to save time. In AWS, Amazon is amassing massive resources, including Nvidia chips and its own, to give cloud customers the tools to build AI applications. Amazon's ability to tie AI into its business could support long-term growth in e-commerce and cloud -- industries with gas left in the tank.\n\n4. Snowflake\n\nData cloud and analytics company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) is a unique Buffett AI stock in that it's the only one Berkshire Hathaway has been invested in since day one. The holding company participated in Snowflake's public offering in 2020 and has held the stock since. It's also the smallest position of the companies on this list and represents just 0.3% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nSnowflake could become an enormous company in the AI era. The company's cloud platform stores and organizes data, allowing customers to easily search and integrate it with third-party apps, all through the cloud. Additionally, Snowflake operates a data marketplace where customers can share data and buy access to third-party data sets to combine with their own.\n\nData is fundamentally the building block of AI as it's all trained on data. That makes Snowflake a potentially crucial party to AI moving forward, and it's noteworthy that Berkshire jumped into the stock early.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Work-From-Home Stocks Still Going Strong",
        "content": "Despite experiencing ups and downs in 2023, work-from-home stocks continue to offer significant upside in our changing economy. The pandemic-induced remote work shift saw an average worker spending over 60% of their workdays from home in 2020. And, in 2023 it hit 25%, which remains firmly entrenched. So, this suggests it will stay this way or increase, marking a substantial fivefold increase from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\n\nWork-from-home stocks encompass companies providing tools, technologies, and services that support and enhance the remote working experience. True, some of these stocks have retreated from their peak values as global conditions return to normalcy. Yet, they still present considerable growth potential. This is especially true as employment trends continue to evolve. It’s an indicator that work-from-home options are here to stay.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on the verge of reaching an unprecedented market capitalization of $4 trillion next year. This achievement is at least partially fueled by work-from-home product popularity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut new inroads into augmented reality (AR) in the workplace could accelerate Apple’s rapid growth. The company already posted notable success with its Vision Pro headsets. They sold around 200,000 units despite the hefty price tag of $3,499. This initial success is expected to spur further sales. As the product demonstrates its work-from-home value and production scales, it reduces costs.\n\nOf course, concerns exist that Vision Pro could start to undercut sales of other Apple products. In particular, tablets and iPads are already experiencing declining sales. Apple finds itself at a critical juncture. It anticipates the stabilization of Vision Pro sales while assessing whether its AR reality technology will be a passing trend. Also, it could be a transformative product changing the way we work like the iPod was in the early 2000s. Regardless of the outcome, Apple currently stands as the leading AR stock. It offers investors a prime opportunity to engage with this burgeoning market through a tried and tested blue-chip company.\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpending the day seated and immobile at your computer does a disservice to your well-being. Researchers often compare prolonged sitting’s health implications to smoking, suggesting a significant impact on life expectancy. While the accuracy of this comparison remains a topic of debate, the consensus is clear.\n\nBeing active and mobile is far preferable to remaining sedentary in an office chair for hours on end. Yet, for the work-from-home segment, sitting is a fact of life. Many look for comfort and optimized posture, and few companies match the caliber of seating solutions Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) offers.\n\nSteelcase specializes in premium, corporate-level office furnishings. Imagine a business tasked with equipping a series of cubicles or conference rooms. Steelcase represents the high-end option in this market. With the rise of remote work, more work-from-home employees choose Steelcase for its robust product lineup. It enhances their home offices with top-tier, comfortable seating options.\n\nOver the last five years, Steelcase navigated challenging times indeed. The shift toward remote working altered its foundational business model and interest rates increased, forcing significant cost reductions. Yet, for those eyeing potential under-the-radar investments within the remote work sector, Steelcase presents a compelling option. This will be especially true if it pivots to serve the growing home office market more directly.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) upwork (UPWK) logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs remote work expands, many work-from-home staffers turn to side gigs for extra income. Further, some even leave their traditional jobs to venture into freelancing full-time. Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) is a work-from-home stock perfectly aligned with this trend.\n\nFrom a user perspective, some of Upwork’s decisions and initiatives tend to be confusing and frustrating. But, from an investment viewpoint, Upwork’s position in the freelancer/client marketplace is unparalleled. It commands over 50% of the total market share in the vast freelancing industry. Further, they attract a clientele that generally offers higher pay than that found on platforms like Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR).\n\nUpwork navigated the changing economic landscape with agility, achieving increased profitability to ensure its survival. The company celebrated its third-ever profitable quarter in its latest earnings report, beating analyst expectations by posting a $0.20 EPS. Furthermore, the gross service volume has remained consistent since early 2021. It’s a testament that Upwork’s business model is resilient even during economic downturns.\n\nYet, the most significant challenge facing Upwork is expanding its enterprise client base. Growth in this segment has seen a slowdown recently. Possibly, this is due to large corporations reducing their freelance budgets or hiring talent directly. However, if Upwork adjusts its enterprise services to attract and retain big clients more effectively, the potential for growth could be immense.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Tony Robbins shares one reminder for those caught up in the 'Magnificent 7' bubble",
        "content": "To those caught in the still-inflating \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stock bubble, it's a worthy endeavor to remember there are 493 other potential equities to invest in within the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nIndustrials, healthcare, and more are there for the picking!\n\nAnd outside of the S&P 500, there could be great investing opportunities in private equity, Treasurys, and hey, maybe even classic cars, if that's your thing.\n\nPut it all together, and this is what's known as diversification— a tried-and-true wealth-building approach tested by millionaires and billionaires alike, life and business strategist Tony Robbins touted.\n\n\"I would just say maintain diversification. We all heard it a million times,\" Robbins told Yahoo Finance at its New York City headquarters (see video above).\n\nThe six-foot-six author, who recently released \"The Holy Grail of Investing,\" says it's a reminder served up by longtime friend and vaunted investor, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. By diversifying, an investor can better reduce correlations between investments — and bring down the potential risk.\n\nKnown for his ultra-high-energy seminars, Robbins, who has a reported net worth of more than $600 million, warned against the AI hype bubble.\n\n\"I am concerned about it as well,\" Robbins said about investors' infatuation with Magnificent Seven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThe diversification reminder couldn't come at a better time as the Magnificent Seven trade has become hyper-correlated and is mostly moving in a singular direction — up and to the right.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven now makes up some 30% of the S&P 500's market cap, in part powered by a hearty reaction to AI chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report a week ago. Said market reaction has Wall Street analysts tripping over themselves to ratchet up profit forecasts, essentially feeding more upward momentum in the group's stock prices.\n\nStory continues Life and business strategist Tony Robbins (left) reminds investors that diversification is important in an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (right). (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the past three months, Magnificent Seven earnings estimates have been revised higher by a lofty 7%, with its margins going up by 86 basis points, said Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nThe average Magnificent Seven stock is up 14% this year, according to Yahoo Finance calculations. Nvidia has led the way with a 60% advance, while Tesla (TSLA) has dropped 23%.\n\nOver the past year, two of the Magnificent Seven companies have seen triple-digit-percentage gains — Nvidia at 239% and Meta (META) at 184%. The S&P 500 is up a very respectable 29% during that time.\n\nSome on the Street are finally beginning to call a timeout on the Magnificent Seven, with reasonable explanations that a reasonable investor should ponder.\n\n\"Elevated expectations and concentrated positioning create a high bar for the Magnificent 7 to beat,\" strategists at JPMorgan Asset Management contended in a new client note. \"AI will be investable for the long-haul and its beneficiaries will include far more than chipmakers.\"\n\nThey added that a soft economic landing and declining interest rates later this year stand to \"bode well for a catch up\" by sectors and companies left behind in last year's rally.\n\nAn argument could be made that not every Magnificent Seven member delivered blowout fourth quarters and outlooks to justify their stock's near-record valuation. Tony Robbins quote\n\nApple's (AAPL) performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), it missed estimates on ad revenue, the core of its business. Tesla's quarter and its Elon Musk-led earnings call were littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — in the near term — that all its AI efforts are going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta's quarter was okay — but it also jacked up its 2024 capital expenditures a ton, which could weigh on margins and cash flow.\n\nThe quarters out of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia have been universally seen as huge.\n\n\"I've done everything in my life by saying success leaves clues. Find the best in the world. Figure out exactly what they do, do the same thing, and your chances of success go up a hundredfold,\" Robbins said.\n\nThe best investors in the game stay diversified — and not by buying seven tech companies that, at times, compete for the same customers.\n\nGive it a thought.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks With Rock-Solid Moats to Buy Now",
        "content": "Stocks have roared higher over the past year, and much of that gain is thanks to the \"Magnificent Seven.\" I'm not talking about the Western that hit the silver screen back in 1960 or a newer version that made it to theaters in 2016, though. The seven I'm talking about are a group of industry-leading companies, all developing cutting-edge technology, with names you'll probably recognize: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nAll of these stocks, with the exception of Tesla, have climbed in the double or triple digits over the past year, helping the indexes rise in this new bull market. There are many reasons to like the Magnificent Seven, from their growth track records to their investments in hot technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese players also stand out for their moats, or competitive advantages. A moat is particularly important because, if it's strong enough, it can help a company hold onto its leadership for the long haul -- and that can result in lasting earnings growth. Two Magnificent Seven stocks, in particular, offer rock-solid moats -- which is one of the reasons they should be on your buy list. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet is the company behind a tool you may use daily: the Google search engine. When most of us need to find out about something, our first reflex often is to \"Google\" it. Advertisers know this, and that's exactly why they flock to Alphabet to advertise their goods or services on Google. These advertising dollars make up the lion's share of the company's revenue -- 75% of it in the recent quarter -- and that's likely to continue, thanks to Alphabet's terrific moat.\n\nThe company's competitive advantage in search is that most of us turn to Google Search as part of our daily routine. And this has helped the platform steadily hold a more than 90% share of the search market. This dominance also has reinforced Alphabet's competitive advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's moat may be about to get even stronger because the company is investing in AI, a technology that can make search even better. The company introduced Gemini, its most powerful AI tool ever, late last year and recently launched the next-generation model -- Gemini Ultra.\n\nAlphabet is testing Gemini in search, and the results have been very positive -- making the process faster -- and generative AI is improving search results in many ways. For example, Google can address more complex questions and offer a broader range of links corresponding to your query.\n\nAll of this should keep people coming back to Google for their search needs -- which means advertisers should stick around, too. On top of this, Alphabet has developed AI tools to help advertisers create their campaigns. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai says the company has seen \"a lot of interest\" here.\n\nToday, Alphabet shares trade for 20x forward earnings estimates. This is an absolute steal for a Magnificent Seven stock with such a fantastic moat.\n\nApple\n\nApple may be a word you pronounce every day in your household -- not referring to the fruit but, instead, to the company that makes so many leading consumer products from the iPhone to the Mac. Owners of Apple products tend to stick with them, regardless of price increases or the offerings or rivals. As a result, this technology giant has enormous brand strength.\n\nThis brand strength is Apple's moat, and so far, it's been rock solid over the long term. In the smartphone market, Apple has held a place among leaders, and last year, rose to the top of the rankings with the iPhone. For the first time ever, the company became the world's No. 1 player in the smartphone market, with a 20% market share, according to research firm IDC.\n\nThe total installed base of Apple's devices recently reached a new record high of 2.2 billion worldwide. Not only did the iPhone's active user base reach a record, but Apple announced an all-time high of iPhone upgraders during the quarter -- which shows that users keep returning to Apple.\n\nBut this doesn't mean Apple's growth is limited to current customers. The company also continues to attract new users to its products. For example, in the recent quarter, about half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those particular products -- and two-thirds of Apple Watch customers were first-time buyers. Apple's brand strength helps it hold onto longtime customers and bring in new ones.\n\nThis strength has helped Apple increase earnings in the triple digits over the past decade -- and grow return on invested capital. That means Apple's investments have been wise ones, and the company has benefited from them. AAPL Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nToday, Apple shares trade for 27x forward earnings estimates. This is a very reasonable price for a company that's delivered so much growth over the long term -- and promises more to come, thanks to its rock-solid moat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Only 7 Tech Stocks You Should Be Watching Now",
        "content": "Wagering on tech stocks involves investing in the vanguard of AI innovation, a sector poised to redefine our digital future. As businesses globally harness the power of AI to push the boundaries of what’s possible, tech stocks emerge as gateways to participate in the next revolution in tech. The fascination with these stocks continues to grow as AI unfolds its transformative power across multiple industries, signaling a new era of digital evolution.\n\nThe shift towards AI-driven technologies marks a major step-change reminiscent of the internet’s explosive growth in the mid-90s. Moreover, Wedbush Securities disagrees with the AI bubble argument, pointing to a foundational shift in the tech sphere, with AI at the forefront. Hence, it’s arguably the best time for investors eyeing tech stocks to back companies shaping an AI-driven future in our daily lives and work.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) never ceases to amaze with its innovative prowess and evolving ability. Due to its pioneering advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout 2023, MSFT stock saw an incredible 58% uptick in value. That wasn’t merely a fleeting success, as it looks to layer AI into its timeless software suite.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, Microsoft’s impressive financials are already benefitting from its AI investments. That shows in its recent quarterly showing, where it posted a stellar $890 million top-line beat and a 16 cents per-share earnings beat. The integration of ChatGPT-like functions into Bing and the Office365 suite, along with the launch of Microsoft 365 Copilot, points to a massive growth runway ahead for the firm. Additionally, the estimates of direct and indirect sales boosts from AI products, including a potential $10 billion incremental annual sales from Copilot, underscore Microsoft’s growth prospects. Given these dynamics, MSFT stock remains one of the top tech stock picks, offering immense upside potential ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a storied player in enterprise software and cloud services, is making significant inroads in the AI space. Its focus on AI cloud infrastructure is a game-changer, likely to increase cost efficiencies for its clients significantly. The company’s latest quarterly showing underscores this direction, with cloud revenues surging 25% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.8 billion, marked by a notable 52% jump in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nMoreover, it is expanding its AI cloud positioning by expanding its global footprint with the construction of 100 new data centers for Microsoft while enhancing 66 existing ones. Its enriched AI portfolio, accessible through its cloud marketplace, is a testament to its forward-looking approach towards democratizing AI tools for businesses globally. With such dynamic growth and strategic positioning, Tipranks’ analysts point to an 11% upside in ORCL stock from its current price while assigning a Moderate Buy rating.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNew York-based global payments giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) wrapped up another impressive year, thriving on the back of rising interest rates. Demonstrating robust financial health, it recently posted its fourth-quarter (Q4) results, with an 11% bump in sales from the prior year and a remarkable 23% surge in net income to $1.93 billion. That performance is a testament to the resilience of consumers, who remained unfazed amid non-essential cutbacks. Hence, for fiscal year 2023, American Express notched a record sales figure of $60.5 billion, achieving 14% growth in EPS to $11.21, buoyed by higher retail credit card rates and consumer spending.\n\nConsequently, the firm announced a generous 17% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 70 cents per share. Looking ahead, the management remains optimistic, projecting a revenue growth of 9% to 11% for fiscal 2024, with anticipated EPS ranging between $12.65 and $13.15. That outlook underscores American Express’ strategic positioning for sustained growth and long-term profitability.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a powerful AI, and it presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Picking up from where it left off last year, Meta Platforms continued to shine in 2024, marked by four consecutive quarters of top-and-bottom-line beats. In its most recent quarter, it announced its first-ever dividend and $40.1 billion in sales, which surpassed estimates by $940.6 million.\n\nFurthermore, Meta’s maverick CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is deeply invested in AI. His investment in the sphere is shown by Meta’s development of its in-house Artemis AI chip and board additions like Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) Hock E. Tan and John Arnold. Also, his competitive stance is further illustrated in his challenge to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the lucrative metaverse-gear space, highlighting the Quest 3 VR headset’s affordability and superiority over Apple’s pricier Vision Pro VR headset. That move not only showcases Meta’s competitive positioning but also its ambition to lead in the adoption of AI and the metaverse.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a bellwether in the streaming sphere, which continues to outperform in a competitive sector. With an array of content that spans movies, TV shows and documentaries, the streaming giant has maintained its growth trajectory despite competitive pressures. Introducing new players during the pandemic did little to shake its stronghold. Instead, Netflix continues to expand its subscriber base at a healthy pace.\n\nIn its Q4 earnings report, Netflix posted a commendable 13% YOY increase in total revenue and subscriber numbers. Moreover, in the past four consecutive quarters, it has beaten earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. However, in Q4, it fell short by 11 cents, on its bottom line.\n\nNevertheless, its growth trajectory mirrors its results during the pandemic’s peak, mainly due to the company’s successful crackdown on password sharing. NFLX stock is up over 40% in the past six months alone, and its exciting content lineup positions it for further gains.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco.

The company recently unveiled AI-driven products, such as its Einstein Copilot. The Einstein Copilot is the company’s new generative AI-powered conversational assistant, developed to enhance every Salesforce application.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s financial performance speaks volumes, with its Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.29, besting analyst estimates by two cents. Also, revenue saw a healthy 10.9% YOY increase to $9.29 billion, surpassing forecasts by $70 million. Notably, subscription and support revenues climbed to $8.75 billion, marking a 12% YOY growth.\n\nMoreover, the company initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share and a significant increase in its share repurchase program by $10 billion. As we advance, the company sets its full-year fiscal 2025 sales guidance between $37.7 billion and $38.0 billion, indicating an 8% to 9% growth YOY.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

Consequently, AMZN is up roughly 11% this month and 30% in the past six months.\n\nAmazon’s success lies in its diversified business model, which covers multiple tech verticals, including advertising, cloud computing, subscription services and other areas. That diversification has yielded substantial sales from its eCommerce operations and its cloud computing juggernaut in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is leveraging AI to solidify its leadership in the cloud sector. With its massive internal reserves, Amazon is looking to go full-steam ahead with its commitment to AI innovation through advanced computing chips, including Graviton4 and Trainium2. AWS continues to shine financially, with its sales up 13% YOY to $24.2 billion and advertising revenue growing 27% to $14.7 billion. Also, its eCommerce segment witnessed a 14% increase. Hence, Amazon’s dominance in the market is clear, offering tremendous upside to investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Will Apple Acquire Rivian? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks it Should",
        "content": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are among the bedrock technologies of the sustainability movement. Unsurprisingly, most legacy car manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen, have experimented with battery-powered vehicles.\n\nBut beyond traditional automakers, some big tech companies have shown an interest in entering the EV market. For the last several years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has reportedly been working on an EV of its own. In a lot of ways, this makes sense. Apple has a long history of innovation, specifically when it comes to consumer electronics. However, just this week, news broke that Apple is abandoning its in-house EV effort, dubbed Project Titan.\n\nDoes this mean that Apple is giving up on its EV ambitions for good?\n\nWall Street's interesting idea\n\nGene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management is one of Wall Street's most respected technology analysts. And while Project Titan appears to have been consigned to the dustbin of tech sector history, Munster just floated an interesting idea.\n\nDuring a discussion on CNBC Tuesday, Munster put forth the notion that Apple should acquire Rivian. This is interesting for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Rivian has demonstrated some success in the highly competitive EV landscape. However, the company seems to be stuck in a \"one step forward, two steps back\" paradigm. In other words, every time it seems to be turning over a new leaf, fresh problems arise. Image Source: Getty Images\n\nApple and Rivian are both in need of growth\n\nOn one side of the equation, you have Apple, a company whose flagship consumer electronics business is struggling. The company's revenue has been in consistent decline as consumers wait longer between upgrades of products such as iPhones, iPads, laptops, and wearable devices.\n\nWhile Apple's Services business is accelerating nicely, that growth has not been enough to offset the lagging hardware sales. As such, Apple is in need of additional growth drivers.\n\nOn the other side of the equation sits Rivian. In 2023, it produced 57,232 vehicles -- an increase of 135% year over year. While that's encouraging, it's not all smooth sailing from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management shocked investors when it guided for essentially flat production in 2024.\n\nApple and Rivian both share a similar problem: In an economic environment defined by interest rates higher than consumers have dealt with in years and the ripple effects of recent high inflation, demand for luxury consumer goods is simply not that strong.\n\nWith both companies desperate to accelerate growth and get investors excited, are Apple and Rivian a match made in heaven?\n\nShould Apple acquire Rivian?\n\nOn the surface, I completely understand Munster's proposal.\n\nFor Rivian, a deal with Apple could be transformative. As part of Apple, it would immediately gain access to a larger team of engineers and technologists, and would have the luxury of Apple's bankroll. Apple, meanwhile, would gain access to the EV market and add yet another product to its sticky ecosystem.\n\nApple currently has more than $73 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Rivian's market capitalization is around $11 billion.Given those parameters, it's clear that Apple could acquire Rivian in an all-cash deal at a pretty generous premium, and still have plenty of change left over.\n\nBut a closer look at Apple's history with regard to making acquisitions puts the possibility of such a hypothetical deal becoming reality in a different light.\n\nApple's largest purchase ever was its $3 billion deal for headphone company Beats Electronics in 2014. Across its 10 largest acquisitions, Apple has spent roughly $7.4 billion.\n\nThose data points make one thing clear: Apple rarely pursues big-ticket acquisitions. So while the idea of it acquiring Rivian is interesting, and while such a deal could even make strategic sense for both companies, I see it as highly unlikely. Large-scale acquisitions have not been part of Apple's DNA, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple-authorised retailers are offering steep discounts on the latest iPhone series in China, in a fresh round of promotions aimed at reviving sales there, as the Californian tech giant faces stiff competition from domestic brands, such as Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max, launched last September, is selling for 8,849 yuan (US$1,230) on Alibaba Group Holding's e-commerce platform Tmall and rival JD.com, roughly 1,150 yuan cheaper than the original price.\n\nAlibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

While iPhone models in the past few years had only incremental upgrades, their Android counterparts have been making technological strides.\n\nNone of the iPhone models are foldable phones, which are becoming increasingly popular among high-end users in China.\n\nApple has also been slower than rivals in incorporating generative artificial intelligence functions into smartphones, although CEO Tim Cook told shareholders this week that the company will disclose its AI plans later this year.\n\nThe iPhone is contending with structural changes in the sector, such as the emergence of a new paradigm in premium mobile phone design, according to a research note in January by Kuo Ming-chi, an analyst at TF International Securities known for his accurate assessment of the Apple supply chain.\n\nThose transformations will lead to a continuous decline in iPhone shipments in the Chinese market this year, he said.\n\nApple reported a nearly 13 per cent drop in revenue from Greater China - which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan - in the December quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Chinese smartphone giants Honor and Xiaomi show AI's vast market potential at MWC Barcelona to challenge Samsung, other global rivals",
        "content": "Chinese smartphone makers, led by Honor and Xiaomi, flexed their generative artificial intelligence (AI) prowess at this year's edition of MWC Barcelona to challenge Samsung Electronics and other major rivals, but it remains to be seen whether they can successfully pull off this ambitious undertaking globally, according to industry analysts.\n\n\"China is a test field for generative AI, and various smartphone features are still in the trial-and-error stage,\" said Lucas Zhong, a Shanghai-based analyst at tech research firm Canalys. But he indicated that the mainland's handset makers are \"more radical\" than their global peers in exploring the potential of generative AI - algorithms like what ChatGPT uses to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations and videos.\n\nAt the four-day MWC Barcelona, the world's biggest mobile communications industry trade show that concluded on Thursday, Honor showcased a string of AI features on its latest 5G Android smartphone, the Magic6 Pro. This handset's Magic Portal function harnesses the power of AI to understand user behaviour and streamline tasks, such as quickly recognising addresses in a text message to direct users to Google Maps.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The handset's AI Album Search function employs natural language processing that enables users to locate specific images within their collections based on a prompt describing them, while AI Portraits can create novel compositions derived from pre-existing images.\n\nXiaomi's new artificial intelligence-enabled Ultra 14 smartphone model.

Photo: Xiaomi>\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreased AI integration in Chinese smartphones shows how a new tech arms race in the industry is heating up, several weeks after Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S24 handsets with AI features based on Google's Gemini technology.\n\nAI was also a major theme at this week's MWC Barcelona, which had its venue festooned with prominent signages of \"AI\" and \"intelligence\". There were also plenty of product demonstrations, from telecommunications network operators and equipment makers to smartphone vendors, that touted the market potential of AI.\n\nAt the current stage, generative AI features on smartphones will not be a determining factor for consumers in their purchase decisions, \"at least not in 2024\", according to Ethan Qi, an associate director at Counterpoint Research.\n\n\"Currently, it is still hype,\" Qi said. \"When we're past the bubble period in two or three years, consumers will see the actual distinctions between an AI phone and what they have now, which would prompt them to upgrade their handsets.\"\n\nStill, the latest AI-enabled devices from Chinese vendors have given this emerging market segment an early start. China last year shipped 5 million AI-capable smartphones, more than any other market worldwide, according to data from Canalys.\n\nMainland smartphone makers have rushed to deepen their commitment to using generative AI on their devices, as all major vendors have each launched their own large language model (LLM) - the technology used to train ChatGPT and similar AI services.\n\nCounterpoint has forecast global shipments of generative AI-enabled (GenAI) smartphones to reach more than 100 million units this year, up from about 47 million in 2023, and rapidly expand to 552 million by 2027.\n\nGenAI handsets, a subset of AI smartphones, use generative AI technology to create original content, rather than just provide preprogrammed responses or perform predefined tasks.\n\nMWC Barcelona attendees check out Honor's stand displaying the new Magic6 Pro smartphone on February 26, 2024. Photo: Agence France-Presse alt=MWC Barcelona attendees check out Honor's stand displaying the new Magic6 Pro smartphone on February 26, 2024. Photo: Agence France-Presse>\n\nBut AI services solely trained on Chinese-language LLMs could lose their edge when these are brought to overseas markets, Counterpoint's Qi said.\n\n\"Different countries have various market-specific requirements for LLMs, from privacy to content generation,\" Qi said. \"Chinese smartphone vendors may need to rely on partnerships with overseas GenAI [system] providers and vie for exclusive capabilities from these partners to offer their consumers a better experience than their rivals.\"\n\nIn the case of Honor, the company's platform-level AI and industry-first intent-based user interface would need input from various software developers owing to how the app landscape overseas differs from the one in China, according to Canalys' Zhong.\n\nTesting AI functions in China, the world's largest smartphone market, before bringing these overseas can provide some insights, Zhong said. But there is still a question mark on whether that would be enough for Chinese AI handset vendors to succeed outside their home market.\n\nSo it is not yet certain how Honor can localise its devices' AI functions by convincing overseas partners to open up their application programming interface and join the company's ecosystem, he added.\n\nChina's major smartphone makers are up against innovative tech powerhouses such as Samsung, which pledged to expand AI capabilities across the firm's product portfolio at MWC Barcelona.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has abandoned its decade-long effort to build an electric car to focus on building its generative AI capabilities, according to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday.\n\nOn the same day, Apple chief executive Tim Cook told the company's annual shareholders meeting that details of its generative AI plans would be disclosed later this year.\n\nWhile Apple's slow pace in generative AI is not threatening enough to affect the US tech giant's global market share, iPhone sales face mounting pressure in mainland China because of a weak macroeconomic environment and the strong comeback of Huawei Technologies in the 5G handset segment. This week, Apple-authorised retailers on the mainland started offering steeper discounts on the latest iPhone 15 series.\n\nTelecoms equipment giant Huawei, one of the biggest exhibitors at MWC Barcelona, only showcased a limited number of smartphone models, including its luxurious Mate 60 RS Ultimate Edition handset that is only available on the mainland.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company, which nearly occupied an entire hall out of eight exhibition halls at MWC Barcelona, did not display its flagship Mate 60 Pro smartphone - powered by its home-grown Kirin 9000S processor that defied US tech restrictions - at the trade show. The popular model has helped US-sanctioned Huawei regain ground on the mainland, despite stiff competition from Apple and other Chinese Android handset vendors.\n\nWhile Huawei remained \"resolutely committed\" to the overseas market, the firm currently has no plans to bring the Mate 60 Pro outside China, the head of international media at Huawei's consumer business group, James Warren, said on the sidelines of MWC Barcelona this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Apple Inc. is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to spend its $73 billion war chest. From the Vision Pro to the Apple Car, it's rolling out new products and producing the next generation of consumer technology. Last week, it was reported that its decade-long Apple Car project is coming to an end. But it looks like the trillion-dollar titan has a new focus: artificial intelligence.\n\nIn a bold move toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem, Apple is setting the stage to unveil a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This initiative, part of iOS 18, signifies a significant leap in Apple’s AI strategy, showcasing a new version of Siri enhanced with generative AI capabilities. The upgrade promises a range of new functionalities, aiming to revolutionize user interactions with Apple devices​​.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth. This $0.25 per share Boston startup is fixing a glaring problem with today's online advertising and is currently crowdfunding.\n\nApple’s AI ambitions extend beyond Siri. The company is reportedly planning to introduce an AI-based tool for completing lines of software code, akin to Microsoft Corp.‘s Copilot. Microsoft continues to be a magnate in the AI space. It has invested billions in OpenAI in a profit-sharing agreement that has also helped power the company's suite of AI-based tools.\n\nThis tool, expected to be integrated into Apple’s Xcode software, could simplify the development process by automatically completing code blocks, potentially transforming how developers work on the Apple platform. In addition to code completion, Apple is exploring AI features for automating Apple Music playlists and enhancing its business presentation software. These advancements indicate Apple’s broader goal to infuse AI across its product range, enhancing user experience and productivity​​.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett funded early-stage startups and made millions. You don't need to be a well-connected billionaire to do the same.\n\nApple’s approach to AI development is characterized by strategic partnerships and technological innovation. The company has been in talks with major publishers for rights to train its generative AI systems using their content, aiming for multiyear agreements. This step underscores Apple’s commitment to refining its AI capabilities through access to vast data sets, ensuring that its AI tools are both powerful and informed by a wide range of information sources​​.\n\nA technical breakthrough has also been reported, with Apple AI researchers developing a method to deploy large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other devices with limited memory. This innovation could bring sophisticated AI functionalities directly into the pockets of millions of users, overcoming previous constraints related to device capabilities. Such advancements highlight Apple’s focus on not just integrating AI into its devices but doing so in a way that is accessible and seamless for everyday use​​.\n\nAs Apple gears up for these AI-driven enhancements, the anticipation grows not only among its user base but also within the broader tech community. The upcoming WWDC is poised to be a landmark event, potentially setting new standards for AI integration in consumer technology. Apple’s strategic investments in AI research and development, coupled with its efforts to ensure ethical and responsible use of AI, reflect a vision that extends beyond mere technological leadership. The company aims to redefine the intersection of AI and user experience, promising a future where Apple devices are not just tools but intelligent companions in the digital age.\n\nRead Next:\n\nOne startup funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and Homeland Security aims to solve this specific nuisance in a spectacular fashion, and you can invest in it today.

        "content": "Friday, March 1, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Intel Corp. (INTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +24.0%). The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. It expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nApple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+181.1% vs. +73.1%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption.\r\n\r\nPeople reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Intel have gained +65.9% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +163.3%. The company is focusing on establishing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and has expanded global production capabilities under its IDM 2.0 (integrated device manufacturing) strategy.\r\n\r\nIt remains on track with its 5N4Y (five nodes in four years) program in order to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel has launched AI chips for data centers and PCs to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector and ubiquitous edge environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, weak demand trends and sluggish recovery in China are affecting its revenues. Macroeconomic challenges, inventory adjustments and intense market volatility are straining margins. Stiff competition in the server, storage and networking markets has hurt its long-term growth potential to some extent. For the first quarter of 2024, Intel has offered muted guidance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

        "title": "Spotify accuses Apple of scare tactics over new EU competition rules",
        "content": "Spotify has accused Apple of trying to “scare everybody about privacy and security” over its complaints about complying with new EU competition laws.\n\nThe music streaming platform’s global director of competition policy said Apple’s warnings about having to make the iPhone less secure in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) equated to the saying “the only way to have privacy and security is to allow a monopolist to continue to abuse monopoly power”.\n\nAvery Gardiner also claimed Apple’s new system does not comply with the DMA as it requires developers to sign up to new business terms and pay new developer fees in order to use alternative app stores and payment systems.\n\nThe DMA, which comes fully into force later this month, requires the biggest tech platforms to give consumers more choice, and in Apple’s case means allowing users to download apps onto their device from outside the App Store for the first time, as well as allowing alternative payment methods in the store. Avery Gardiner claimed Apple’s new system does not comply with the DMA (PA)\n\nOn Friday, Apple published details on how it plans to do this, and new security features it was putting in place to prevent malicious apps from reaching iPhone handsets as the platform opened up, but warned it could not eliminate the risk entirely under this new system for EU users.\n\nBut Ms Gardiner, Spotify’s competition policy lead, said the notion that security and privacy could only come from Apple’s own App Store was “just not true”.\n\n“If Apple were the only way to keep things private and secure, why haven’t Android users left Android in droves for Apple over concerns about privacy and security? They haven’t,” she told the PA news agency.\n\n“This has been their tactic globally – scare everybody about privacy and security.\n\n“Tell them that the only way to have privacy and security is to allow a monopolist to continue to abuse monopoly power. I understand why they’re doing it, but it’s not truthful.”\n\nMs Gardiner also criticised the iPhone maker over its proposed new business terms for developers as part of its DMA changes, which developers can opt not to sign up to, but would be unable to use the alternate app stores or payment method tools as a result.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Apple’s own documents, although the new terms will see developers pay a reduced commission of either 10 or 17% – down from between 15 and 30% – there will be an additional 3% “payment processing fee” to use Apple’s payment system.\n\nA new “core technology fee” will also be in place which will charge developers 0.50 euros for each new user per year over the one million user threshold.\n\nThe tech giant says with the choice of existing or new business terms, 99% of EU developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe Apple, and less than 1% would pay the core technology fee.\n\nBut Ms Gardiner said Apple’s approach did not comply with the DMA, and suggested the European Commission could launch a new investigation into the tech giant under the new rules.\n\n“Apple has announced a set of proposed rules that do not comply with the DMA,” she said.\n\n“At the most basic level, the idea that you have to opt in to an onerous new fee structure in order to avail yourselves of the rights granted to you by the European Parliament is bizarre.\n\n“The DMA is really clear: App stores have to let developers communicate offers free of charge. Those are the words. It doesn’t say ‘as long as you opt into an onerous new fee structure that would impose a massive tax on you’.\n\n“It is on its face, not compliant with the DMA, and the commission is going to need to open an investigation unless Apple changes its tune.”\n\nShe added that the fees were a “very clever design” to “evade the entire purpose of the DMA” by incentivising developers to not sign up to the new system which would enable alternative app store use.\n\n“And that means that alternative app stores will never achieve the scale that they would need to be commercially viable, because most of the large free apps would face an impossible financial penalty if they opted in,” she said.\n\n“So that means that those alternative app stores will never reach scale, and never impose the competitive pressure on the (Apple) App Store that the DMA is designed to facilitate, so it’s a clever way to frustrate the very purpose of the DMA, and I think the commission is going to see it for what it is.”",

        "content": "(0:30) - Should You Buy More of The Magnificent 7? (8:00) - If Warren Buffett Buys Apple, Should You Buy Too? (32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four lynchpins of Berkshire Hathaway’s business.\n\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap\n\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple’s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\n\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It’s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\n\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It’s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple’s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\n\nCriteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock\n\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\n\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a “moat.”\n\nAlphabet’s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\n\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\n\nWill Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast for Tracey’s analysis of Alphabet’s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 1, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nThese 3 Companies Posted Record-Breaking Quarters\n\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\n\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "(Adds detail, paragraphs 3-9)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - A number of government agencies in the European Union and elsewhere have voiced concerns about security risks as Apple opens up its iPhones and iPads to rival app stores to comply with EU tech rules, Apple said on Friday.\n\nUnder the Digital Markets Act (DMA), from March 7 Apple will be required to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant, which on Jan. 24 detailed the changes to bring its App Store in line with the EU rules, said \"sideloading\" - installation of applications on a mobile device without using its dedicated app store - has sparked concerns from both EU and non-EU government agencies and users.\n\nAllowing the practice is among reforms that some lawmakers hope will help open up the market for apps.\n\n\"These agencies - especially those serving essential functions such as defense, banking, and emergency services - have reached out to us about these new changes,\" Apple said in a guidance paper.\n\nIt said the agencies wanted assurances that they would be able to prevent government employees from sideloading apps onto government-purchased iPhones and that several said they planned to block sideloading on every device they manage.\n\n\"One EU government agency informed us that it had neither the funding nor the personnel to review and approve apps for its devices, and so planned to continue to rely on Apple and the App Store because it trusts us to comprehensively vet apps,\" Apple said.\n\nThe company did not provide details on the number of concerned agencies and the countries where they are located.\n\nFirms such as Fortnite creator Epic Games and Spotify Technology, have for years said that Apple's commissions and restrictions impede their businesses.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Jason Neely and Tomasz Janowski)",

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nDell forecasts upbeat fiscal 2025 on AI server demand\n\n*\n\nGoldman Sachs removes Apple from conviction list\n\n*\n\nNYCB plunges as loan review disclosure adds to CRE exposure concerns\n\n*\n\nFutures: Dow off 0.11%, S&P down 0.08%, Nasdaq flat\n\n(Updated at 7:05 a.m. ET/1205 GMT)\n\nBy Amruta Khandekar and Johann M Cherian\n\nMarch 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were muted on Friday after a rally in the previous session, driven by enthusiasm about the potential for artificial intelligence and an inflation reading that strengthened bets of interest rate cuts by June this year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record high on Thursday, spurred by gains in AI-linked stocks such as heavyweight chip designer Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices, which hit an all-time peak.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the key driver of the AI-led rally on Wall Street this year, were up 0.9% in premarket trade, while those of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 2.6% after a 9% surge in the previous session.\n\nThe Wall Street rally found further support as the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report came in-line with expectations on Thursday and showed annual inflation growth was the smallest in three years.\n\nStill, some analysts pointed to signs of stubborn price pressures posing a threat to prospects of rate cuts in the first half of the year.\n\n\"Inflation is still sticky and bumpy. We know that the Federal Reserve won't be able to cut the interest rate anytime before summer,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\nAdding to the risk-off mood on Friday, New York Community Bancorp slumped 25.5% after the regional lender said it had found \"material weaknesses\" in internal controls related to its loan review and revised its fourth-quarter loss 10 times above the previously stated numbers.\n\nShares of other regional banks Zions Bancorp and Keycorp fell 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 7:05 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 41 points, or 0.11%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.08%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.25 points, or 0.02%.\n\nAll three indexes clocked their fourth straight monthly gains on Thursday, while the S&P 500 notched a fresh closing high as euphoria around AI and a strong fourth-quarter earnings season propelled stocks to new heights in February.\n\nInvestors now await data on manufacturing activity and consumer sentiment as well as remarks from Fed officials including Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly later in the day for further clues on the interest rate path.\n\nAmong other stocks, cybersecurity firm Zscaler shed 7.5% as the company reported higher operating expenses in the second quarter.\n\nDell Technologies jumped 22.3% after the personal computer maker forecast annual revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates, betting on demand for its AI servers.\n\nAutodesk gained 8.7% as the company's annual revenue forecast exceeded expectations on resilient demand for its design software products.\n\nApple slipped 0.8% after brokerage Goldman Sachs removed the iPhone maker's stock from its conviction list.\n\nEverbridge surged 24.1% after private equity firm Thoma Bravo increased its offer price for the software firm, valuing it at about $1.8 billion.

        "content": "Apple has warned that complying with new EU competition laws will make the iPhone less secure than it currently is, as the tech giant published new details on how its new approach will work.\n\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) is set to come into effect shortly, and requires tech giants to give consumers more choice.\n\nAs a result, Apple will be required to allow users to switch alternative app stores and download apps outside of Apple’s own App Store for the first time, as well as allow alternative payment methods.\n\nThe iPhone maker has published a new whitepaper, laying out how it will introduce new features to protect users from cyber attacks, malware and other risks under this new system, but the company has said it cannot eliminate the risks entirely.\n\nUntil now, only apps approved by Apple to appear in its App Store have been accessible for download on the iPhone, and purchases made in the App Store must be done through Apple’s own payment system – a so-called “walled garden” which Apple argues allows it to keep users and their data completely secure.\n\nIn its new report, Apple warns that because it is being required to change its “uniquely successful approach” used to “protect users’ security and privacy”, it will “not be able to protect users in the same way”.\n\n“To keep offering users the most secure, most privacy-protecting, and safest platform — in line with what users expect from Apple — we’ve designed and implemented new safeguards that will help to protect and inform them,” the whitepaper says.\n\n“While the changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap between the protections that Apple users outside of the EU can rely on and the protections available to users in the EU moving forward, we are working tirelessly to make sure iPhone remains the safest of any phones available in the EU by reducing the risks introduced by these necessary changes—even though we cannot entirely eliminate such risks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder its new system, Apple says it will introduce a new baseline review programme for all apps, regardless of whether they will be distributed via the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.\n\nApple says it will electronically sign each app that is distributed in the EU once it has been checked and cleared for “known malware and security threats, generally functions as advertised, and doesn’t expose users to egregious fraud”.\n\nHowever, the company confirmed that these new checks will not cover app content.\n\nAnd it warned this could see content it does not allow inside the App Store appear within its iPhone operating system in the EU.\n\n“This means Apple won’t be able to prevent apps with content that Apple wouldn’t allow on the App Store — like apps that distribute pornography, apps that encourage consumption of tobacco or vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol, or apps that contain pirated content (or that otherwise steal ideas or intellectual property from other developers) — from becoming available on alternative app marketplaces,” the whitepaper said.\n\nBut the US tech giant did pledge to “ongoing monitoring” of apps to detect and remove any malicious applications it uncovers.\n\nUnder the new system in the EU, Apple will also begin showing users pop-up, on-screen alerts when they are about to leave the App Store to download an app or make a payment outside of the store and Apple’s payment system.\n\nThe company said this would allow users to make “educated choices about the apps they download”.\n\nApple said it had been contacted by consumers, governments and government agencies both inside and outside the EU asking for assurance and clarity on the safety of the platform under the new rules.\n\nA number of other tech firms have previously accused Apple of maintaining a monopoly of the app market by not allowing rival app marketplaces or payment methods on the App Store.\n\nThe European Commission argues that the DMA offers more and better services for consumers to choose from, and increases opportunities to switch providers if they so wish, which will ultimately lead to fairer prices and boost innovation in the sector.",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -A number of government agencies in the European Union and elsewhere have voiced concerns about security risks as Apple opens up its iPhones and iPads to rival app stores to comply with EU tech rules, Apple said on Friday.\n\nUnder the Digital Markets Act (DMA), from March 7 Apple will be required to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant, which on Jan. 24 detailed the changesto bring its App Store in line with the EU rules, said \"sideloading\" - installation of applications on a mobile device without using its dedicated app store - has sparked concerns from both EU and non-EU government agencies and users.\n\nAllowing the practice is among reforms that some lawmakers hope will help open up the market for apps.\n\n\"These agencies - especially those serving essential functions such as defense, banking, and emergency services - have reached out to us about these new changes,\" Apple said in a guidance paper.\n\nIt said the agencies wanted assurances that they would be able to prevent government employees from sideloading apps onto government-purchased iPhones and that several said they planned to block sideloading on every device they manage.\n\n\"One EU government agency informed us that it had neither the funding nor the personnel to review and approve apps for its devices, and so planned to continue to rely on Apple and the App Store because it trusts us to comprehensively vet apps,\" Apple said.\n\nThe company did not provide details on the number of concerned agencies and the countries where they are located.\n\nFirms such as Fortnite creator Epic Games and Spotify Technology, have for years said that Apple's commissions and restrictions impede their businesses.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Jason Neely and Tomasz Janowski)",

        "title": "Is Apple the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" are some of the most dominant businesses in the world. As a result, their shares, which have soared in price in recent times, are in many investors' portfolios.\n\nAt its current market cap of $2.8 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) doesn't need an introduction. The maker of popular hardware and software products is a financially lucrative enterprise. And its stock has climbed 316% in the last five years, crushing the returns of the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nApple is also Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far. But is it the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now?\n\nLow growth, high price\n\nApple isn't putting up growth numbers like it used to. Revenue increased by 2.1% in its fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, but dropped in each of the four previous quarters. On average, Wall Street analysts expect sales to rise at an annualized clip of 4.2% over the next three fiscal years.\n\nThat's hardly any reason to get excited. In fact, it puts Apple dead last when compared to the other Magnificent Seven businesses. The other six are forecast to post much faster top-line growth, according to consensus analyst estimates.\n\nBlame it on macro headwinds or consumers no longer feeling the need to upgrade to the newest Apple device as often. But investors are probably smart not to expect double-digit percentage revenue gains from Apple anymore.\n\nHowever, the stock trades as if strong growth is a foregone conclusion. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.2 is a huge premium compared to its trailing-10-year average of 21. This is a stock that's best kept on the watch list for now, in my opinion.\n\nDigital ad giants\n\nOf all the Magnificent Seven stocks, I believe two stand out as the best to buy right now. I'm talking about the giants in the digital ad market: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nGrowth isn't a concern for these internet enterprises. Alphabet reported revenue of $307 billion in 2023, up 8.7%, while Meta's sales climbed 15.7% to $135 billion. Because the global digital advertising industry has many years of expansion ahead, these two businesses are poised to remain major beneficiaries. Combined, they command nearly 60% of the worldwide digital advertising market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that both Alphabet and Meta possess powerful competitive advantages, the most notable of which are their network effects. Alphabet's Google Search and YouTube are incredibly popular internet services that get better with more information, content, and users, as are Meta's various social media apps -- a situation that makes things extremely difficult for their smaller rivals.\n\nIn the last five years, Alphabet and Meta have averaged operating margins of 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively. Plus, they both produce ridiculous amounts of operating cash flow, giving them the financial resources to invest aggressively in artificial intelligence capabilities, while at the same time repurchasing a lot of their outstanding shares.\n\nInvestors are being asked to pay forward P/E multiples of just 20.3 for Alphabet and 24.1 for Meta. By that metric, they are the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, which makes them no-brainer investments in my book.\n\nWhile Apple is surely one of the highest-quality companies in the world, its current setup doesn't position it favorably to deliver market-beating long-term returns. Based on their attractive business characteristics and compelling valuations, Alphabet and Meta are the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSave your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?\n\nAfter an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.\n\nIf the decision was an admission of defeat — Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette — it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"\n\nScuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\nOthers have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.\n\nAnd leaving the automotive ambitions in the software realm means never having a 3,000-pound dented, muddy, and — most of all — rusty product sullying the world's cleanest brand on the road. Or on a lawn. As long as the updates keep coming it will be forever new.\n\nApple took so long to walk away from the expensive gamble that the tardiness looks like timeliness. New entrants have upped the competition in the electric vehicle market, sparking price wars and squeezing margins.\n\nEven Tesla, the EV king whose anti-Detroit rebellion inspired Apple's vehicular ambitions, has hit roadblocks. Slowing demand projected in 2024 has darkened the company's outlook. And without Big Tech's sprawling operations that span multiple sectors, Tesla has fewer business lines to rely on. The stock is down nearly 20% so far this year. As improbable as Tesla’s rise has been, its long-term success still hinges on largely unproven autonomous technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe astonishing growth of Magnificent Seven winners, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT), further presses the question of why Apple would chase Tesla when the early days of developing AI tools have been so promising.\n\nMusk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.\n\nBut there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.\n\nAt the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "On Feb. 2, Dr. Aarish Syed Ishaqi arrived at the Apple store on New York’s Fifth Avenue early in the morning—around 5:30a.m.—to pick up the much-anticipated Apple Vision Pro.\n\nIshaqi, a self-described “crazy Apple fan” and small shareholder in the company, had pre-ordered the $3,500 mixed reality headset to add to his collection of Apple products. But he still wanted to be first in line to pick up the Vision Pro—and he was. Later that day, Ishaqi’s face would be plastered across the internet and TikTok as he emerged from the store with a big grin and a box, posing for photos and videos amid a cheering throng of Apple employees as he triumphantly held his trophy aloft.\n\n“It was pretty surreal,” Ishaqi says, noting he met Apple CEO Tim Cook at the New York opening, his third encounter with the Apple boss in the last 12 months.\n\nCook has billed the Vision Pro as a “revolutionary device” for Apple’s product lineup. And while the company has explicitly kept expectations modest for this first version of the device, positioning it primarily as something for super-fans and developers, Apple’s ultimate goal is for the Vision Pro to create an entirely new product category for its business, similar to the iPhone.\n\nThe big question is whether the Vision Pro will fare any better than past generations of virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, from Meta’s Quest 3 to the ill-fated Google Glass, which have struggled to catch on outside of niche audiences such as gamers. Early reviews of the Vision Pro have marveled at its capabilities, but flagged shortcomings like the strain it can place on a wearer’s eyes and neck after long durations, and the limited number of apps currently available. Perhaps most worrisome for Apple are reports that many consumers have returned the Vision Pro after playing with it for a few days, deciding it wasn’t what they expected or that it wasn't worth the not-insignificant price they paid for it.\n\nSo Fortune tracked down the person who may be the most famous Vision Pro user: Ishaqi, the first person in New York to get their hands on the device and the unofficial poster-boy for the Apple Vision Pro. What does he think of his purchase after several weeks? How often does he wear it? Has he returned it? Has it changed his life? His reality?\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s what Ishaqi told us.\n\nHe expected some hiccups with a first-generation product\n\nIshaqi, who lives in New Jersey, carted the device back for his whole family to try. (“It was a pretty heavy box,” he says) His sister and both his parents all tried it on. His sister and mother, in particular, said they had a slight neck strain while wearing it, and Ishaqi agreed it is “a bit heavy.”\n\n“The whole weight is on the front of your face. It's unbalanced,” he said, though he noted it didn’t personally bother him much. Dr. Aarish Syed Ishaqi wearing the Apple Vision Pro. Courtesy of Dr. Aarish Syed Ishaqi\n\nSo far, Ishaqi has used the Vision Pro primarily for entertainment: To watch movies and play games like the immersive game Synth Riders on Apple Arcade. Ishaqi describes using the device as like having your own “personal theater” with extraordinarily crisp imagery—although the battery life is limited (it has lasted him about three to four hours, he says, which he hopes will improve over time). His other main complaint was that the dark scenes in some movies he watched had a glare, with a reflection in the lenses.\n\n“These are the downsides that I've seen,” he says, though he notes he expected some hiccups with a first-generation product and expects Apple will improve the product over time.\n\nAs a doctor doing oncology research and pursuing a medical career, Ishaqi is animated about the potential he sees with certain medical applications, including Insight Heart and Surgical AR Vision, which offer 3D medical animation technology.\n\n“It is a first gen product. So there are some quirks, but the potential is pretty crazy… It is a breakthrough in my opinion,” he says.\n\nSo was it worth it?\n\nIshaqi says he was a bit nervous that he wouldn’t like the Vision Pro technology. After all, he had tried on Meta’s Quest 3 headset, but struggled with distortion issues. He says his hands would become wavy through the lenses when he moved them up and down.\n\n“It is a bit annoying,” Ishaqi says of the Quest. “With Apple, there was zero such issue.” Overall, he's very impressed with the technology compared to what else is in the market.\n\nStill, Ishaqi admits that he uses his Vision Pro less frequently than he expected when he bought it. He didn't expect it to be so heavy to wear or to be so isolating. When there's company over, Ishaqi says it feels odd wearing the headset even though a Vision Pro wearer can see everyone around them by adjusting the so-called pass-through feature. And using it in a public setting, like on the train or at the library, attracts stares — not least because of the in-the-air hand gestures involved.\n\n“So far, I haven't used it much,” Ishaqi told me. The Vision Pro is mostly strapped on and switched on for watching videos, which he says ends up being about one hour a day on average.\n\nWhen I asked Ishaqi whether it was worth it, he said it depends.\n\n“For someone like me? Yes,” he says. “But I don't think someone really needs it. Like I said, it's a great experience, but $4,000 just for movies—I think it is a bit much.”\n\nIf the technology becomes cheaper and lighter in the next few years, and as app developers continue to introduce more applications, Ishaqi says it will make more sense for the average consumer, and that “everyone's going to have this,” he says.\n\nAs an early adopter, Ishaqi has no plans to return the Vision Pro. He’s glad he bought it. And besides—the 14-day return window has lapsed.\n\nMore Apple Vision Pro coverage from Fortune:\n\nA working parent’s review of the Apple Vision Pro\n\nTim Cook pitches Apple’s new Vision Pro headset as a must-have for businesses despite augmented reality’s checkered history in the workplace\n\nIf Apple can’t make smart goggles happen, nobody can.

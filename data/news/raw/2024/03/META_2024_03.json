        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten AI stocks that will skyrocket. If you want to skip our overview of the AI industry and all the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nIf we were to rewind the hands of time to 18 months back, not a lot of people would be hyped up about artificial intelligence. For the general public, the term would belong squarely to the realm of science fiction, and for those in the industry, AI becoming a worldwide phenomenon would appear to be a thing of the distant future.\n\nYet, with the first quarter of 2024 now over, AI is neither exclusively in the realm of science fiction and it is already a global phenomenon. The ball that started to roll with the debut of ChatGPT to the public in late 2022 and early 2024 has now sent chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by a whopping 518% since the close of 2022. At the same time, dozens of companies claiming to use large language models to help users with their daily lives are now live. They are joined by others that are selling video and image generation software for an industry whose computing needs are thought to sit in billions, if not trillions of dollars.\n\nThese computing needs are also at the center of a fundamental shakeup in the semiconductor industry. Before we get to that though, it's important to understand what AI really is. In layman's terms, AI is a set of mathematical formulae that seek to generate conclusions to queries or problems based on patterns that have been gleaned through training from an existing data set. The more voluminous and relevant this data set is, the better an AI system is, and voluminous data sets require large amounts of semiconductor chips called AI accelerators and GPUs for their processing.\n\nWhile the software end of AI is quite diverse, the hardware end can prove to be a bigger bottleneck simply due to the nature of chip fabrication. Making chips is neither cheap nor easy, and therefore, only a handful of companies in the world are capable of manufacturing high end semiconductors. In fact, only the American Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) are capable of making advanced AI chips. Out of these, only TSMC has been able to rapidly mass produce the latest chips, while Intel is catching up with its technology roadmap and Samsung fails to capture market share to stand its ground with TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis complexity and cost of manufacturing semiconductors is also why we regularly see unbelievable funding estimates for AI. In fact, the latest such bit comes from the The Information in form of a project that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI are working on. According to the details, the two plan on building a $100 billion U.S. based artificial intelligence supercomputer. The price tag is unsurprising since a single NVIDIA Blackwell GPU - one of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the world - costs between $30,000 to $40,000 according to fresh statements by NVIDIA chief Jensen Huang.\n\nSpeaking of Mr. Huang, even before the AI fever, he has advocated new technologies through which 'software will end up writing software' regularly during his technology conferences and earnings call reports. Now, with AI a permanent part of investor vocabulary, Huang's vision also appears to be coming to fruition. This is through the well known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed startup Cognition Labs considering raising funding for a valuation of a whopping $2 billion. Cognition Labs seeks to develop an AI based tool to write code.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of AI stocks that could skyrocket, another major player in the AI race has been the Menlo Park, California based social media firm Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Before AI, Meta was one of the worst performing mega cap stocks on the market as investors remained unconvinced about its foray into the metaverse. However, it's a Wall Street AI darling now, with the shares up 129% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners had to say about Meta in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nMeta Platforms was a leading contributor to performance for the quarter – and the year. Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform’s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios.\n\nSo, wondering about which AI stocks will skyrocket? We shared our #1 AI stock pick that is trading at a steep discount with our premium subscribers, but there are other investment newsletters that have different stocks in mind. In this article we will take a look at what other investment newsletters think about the best way to bet on the future of AI. 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\nA high-tech robotic drone, showcasing the company's advancements in unmanned aerial systems.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the AI stocks that will skyrocket, we ranked AI stocks covered by multiple investment newsletter websites dating back as far as November 28th, 2023 by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023.\n\nFor these AI stocks that will skyrocket, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\n10. GSI Technology, Inc.

        "title": "Here's How Much Dividend Income You'd Make by Investing $70,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "You don't buy growth stocks primarily to receive income. Many of these stocks don't pay dividends at all. However, that doesn't mean you can't earn dividend income from growth stocks.\n\nThe biggest growth stocks on the planet right now are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Can you count on sitting back and having dividends pour in with these stocks? Yes -- at least with some of them. Here's how much dividend income you'd make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nA dividend divide\n\nThere's a clear \"dividend divide\" among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Although they all arguably make enough money to pay dividends, only four actually do so.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) initiated its dividend program in 2003. Since then, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) technically began paying quarterly dividends decades ago. However, the company ended its dividend program in 1995 and didn't resume distributing dividends until 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple has consistently increased its dividend payout.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most surprising dividend stock in the Magnificent Seven. The big chipmaker first declared a quarterly dividend in 2012. Nvidia increased its dividend regularly for several years but has maintained a steady payout since late 2019.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the newest Magnificent Seven dividend payer. The social media company initiated its dividend program earlier in 2024.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Tesla don't currently offer dividends. That could change in the future for two of the three, though. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that Amazon and Alphabet could begin paying dividends, perhaps as soon as this year.\n\nCounting the money\n\nSo how much dividend income could you make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks? If you bought $10,000 of each stock, the total would be just under $170. The following table breaks down how much in dividends each stock would contribute:\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $71.00 Apple 0.56% $56.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $41.00 Nvidia 0.018% $1.80 Amazon N/A $0.00 Alphabet N/A $0.00 Tesla N/A $0.00 Total $169.80\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nOf course, if you were truly seeking dividend income you probably wouldn't buy shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. Let's crunch the numbers assuming you invested $70,000 split equally across the four dividend payers in the Magnificent Seven ($17,500 in each stock). The following table shows how much you'd make:\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $124.25 Apple 0.56% $98.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $71.75 Nvidia 0.018% $3.15 Total $297.15\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nWould most income investors be happy with an annual dividend income of less than $300 from an initial investment of $70,000? Probably not.\n\nLimited magnificence\n\nThe magnificence of the Magnificent Seven stocks is limited. None of them offer attractive dividends. The best dividend payer in the group, Microsoft, still has a dividend yield of barely over half of the yield of the S&P 500.\n\nDividends are an afterthought if you're investing in the Magnificent Seven. Buy these stocks for their growth prospects. Many other stocks are more magnificent if you want solid dividend income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is a No-Brainer Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- have driven the market higher in recent months. This group of standout technology stocks led the S&P 500 to a new record high, confirming we're in a bull market.\n\nThe excitement doesn't end here. Bull markets generally favor growth stocks, so these players could continue to thrive in the months and possibly years to come.\n\nIf you want to get in on the Magnificent Seven story, you don't have to buy shares of every one of these top companies, however. Adding even one or two to your portfolio could offer you a significant boost over time.\n\nBut which one to choose? Today, social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) makes a no-brainer buy -- even after its nearly 40% gain this year -- for the following three reasons. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. A commitment to artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nMeta is investing heavily in AI with the idea of making the technology available through all of its products and services down the road. It's already starting, with features like Meta AI, an advanced conversational assistant available on the company's social media platforms. This is possible thanks to the company's large language model Llama, and Meta is now training the latest version -- Llama 3.\n\nMeta sticks by its open-source software infrastructure, meaning its available for public use. This is a smart move as it may help the company perfect its technology (thanks to feedback) and become an industry leader as more and more people use its platforms.\n\nThe tech giant aims to have 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) on board by the end of the year to power its AI ambitions and has said AI will be the company's biggest investment area in 2024.\n\n2. A solid moat that drives profit\n\nAI could significantly lift Meta's profit down the road, but right now, the company's social media applications -- including Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- are in the driver's seat. The company's moat, or competitive advantage, is so strong it's likely these apps will continue to generate revenue growth over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvertisers flock to reach people by advertising on these apps, creating a solid revenue stream for Meta. The company's competitive advantage is that its apps are broadly used worldwide, and because of that, it's very difficult to switch to another platform. After all, many of your contacts may not be on that other platform. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's apps every day.\n\nMeta also benefits because its social media apps appeal to a broad range of people, from young to old. These people use these apps for both leisure and professional use. The company's AI developments may prompt users to spend more time on the apps -- making advertisers even more eager to spend their budgets there.\n\n3. Shares are dirt cheap\n\nMeta has grown earnings over time, thanks to the strength of its social media platform, which keeps advertisers coming back. Long-term prospects look promising for both the social media business and the addition of AI to the picture.\n\nAnalysts predict double-digit growth annually for the company over the coming five years, and Meta's revenue has steadily climbed through the years, reaching record levels. That makes today's valuation of 24x forward earnings estimates look dirt cheap, offering investors a great entry point.\n\nIt's important to remember that estimates used in the calculation are for next year, so this is a rather short-term view. This picture doesn't consider earnings potential further down the road -- at a time when Meta's AI projects may really take off.\n\nAll of this means that right now is the perfect time to get in on this Magnificent Seven stock. It has plenty of room to run, even after recent gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024.\n\nChina Loses 155 Billionaires\n\nThe three largest economies in the world including China, India, and the United States lead with the highest number of billionaires in 2024. China and the US have no competition when it comes to paving the way for millionaires to become billionaires due to large markets and growth potential. India is not behind too and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. China, India, and the US will be the top three largest economies in the world by 2100. China will be the leading economy followed by India and the US. According to the Hurun report for the Global Rich List 2024, the United States added the most billionaires, introducing 109 new billionaires to the list. India was the second best country, adding 84 new people to the list of billionaires. Though foreseeable, China caught most off guard and lost 155 billionaires due to the economic distress and property market crisis.\n\nChina’s economy is going through a systemic slowdown. As we mentioned in our article about 36 countries with deflation or dangerously low inflation, China is suffering from low inflation and it could lead to deflation. China had a successive series of declines in its consumer price index (CPI) during 2023, which started falling in January 2023 and continued till July 2023. The CPI plunged from 104 points in January 2023 to 102.7 points in July 2023. China’s bigger issue is its property market crisis. China's real estate development dropped by 9.6% and home sales fell by 6.5% in 2023. More than 50 real estate companies have defaulted on debt due to the property market crash in China. Real estate giant, The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) is one of the many companies facing default. On March 22, Reuters reported that Chinese authorities are looking into PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for its potential role in The China Evergrande Group’s (OTC:EGRNQ) $78 billion fraud. In addition, the Chinese authorities have fined The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) and Chairman Hui Ka Yan 4.2 billion yuan and 47 million yuan, respectively. The company and chairman have been fined for accounting and bond issuance fraud.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaires Benefiting from AI\n\nGlobally, billionaires increased by 167 to a total of 3,279 in 2024, as per the Hurun report. New York claimed the first spot for the first time in seven years with 119 billionaires choosing to live there followed by London with 97 billionaires. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a main cause for the rise of billionaires as half of new billionaires were driven by AI. Around 10% of the billionaires were from financial services, followed by 8% in consumer goods and 7% in food and beverages. Here is what Hurun’s chief researcher, Rupert Hoogewerf, said:\n\n“AI has been the major driver for wealth growth, generating over half of all the new wealth this year. Whilst Jensen Huang has grabbed many of the headlines as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) broke through the $2 trillion mark and catapulting into the Hurun Top 30 as a result, the billionaires behind Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have seen significant surges in their wealth as investors bet on the value of generated AI.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the real deal with a massive success in AI. In the last six months, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has soared over 100% due to its success in AI, as of March 29. On March 18, the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, during the NVIDIA GTC 2024 Keynote announced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. This platform is built on purpose to power the new era of AI computing. The NVIDIA Blackwell GPU will be used in the automotive industry and will be integrated into the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized car computer to support generative AI applications and immersive in-vehicle experiences.\n\nMark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has jumped 12 places to fourth spot among the world’s richest people. Zuckerberg has a net worth of around $170 billion, as of March 29, 2024. A year ago in 2023, Zuckerberg’s net worth was around $90 billion. In the last six months, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares have soared over 185%, as of March 29, driven by the AI hype. On February 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $5.33, beating consensus estimates by $0.39. The revenue came in at around $40.11 billion, surpassing estimates by $940.64 million. Here are some of the comments from the company’s Q4 2023 earning call:\n\n“This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse. And last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products.\n\nNow moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with.”\n\nWith this context, let’s take a look at the countries with most billionaires in 2024. 25 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024\n\nA crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024, we took the data from the Hurun Global Rich List 2024.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit.\n\nThe advantages of international mobility and a second country where one could live and work has gained much prominence over the years. While immigration and citizenship laws across countries have become friendlier (check out our article on 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World), acquiring citizenship or permanent residency requires substantial time-- other than for direct citizenship by investment programs-- and energy. However, another way to live and work in a country can be easily obtained through a residence permit.\n\nResidence Permit: An Overview\n\nA residence permit is basically a document that provides the holder a right to live in a specific country for a specific period of time. The residence permit allows one to live, buy property, cross border, do business, take advantage of medical facilities, and enroll in educational institutions, among others. There are multiple ways of getting a residence permit, which includes marriage, work, study, or investment. The need for international diversification in terms of both human force and foreign direct investment has propelled countries to recognize the need for making special provisions for investors, businessmen and highly qualified and skilled individuals.\n\nIt is thus, no wonder that the issuance of residence permit have registered an increase over the years. In European Union countries, for instance, 3.7 million first residence permits were issued in 2022 to non-EU citizens, a 26% increase (+753445 permit) from 2021. While there are various ways to obtain a residence permit -- with “Employment Reasons” taking the larger share (42%) of all first residence permits for EU countries in 2021 -- the investment route (Golden Visa) is by far the easier and quicker option.\n\nThe global demand for investor visas have sustained an upward trend with more than 165,000 people opting for them from the US, UK, Canada, and EU countries during the years 2008-2022. One of the popular investor visas include the US EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program that has been operating for more than 30 years. From 2010-2019, the US approved 81,125 investor visas, which is higher than the combined visas issued by Canada, UK, and Portugal. A rise in the trend for European Golden Visas have also been noted. Greece, for example, recorded a 63% increase in the demand for their residence permit programs—from January to May 2023, 3,900 Golden Visa applications had been submitted as compared to 1,444 in 2022. Canada, through their Start-Up Visa, also allowed 175 new permanent residents in August, 2023, a 29.6% increase from July, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped Countries: A Prosperous Investment Avenue\n\nDeveloped countries like the US, Canada and EU states have prosperous economies that foster investment. America is the world’s largest national economy and a global leader in trade. Home to some of the top companies in the world like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc., the US investment environment is bound to attract investors and entrepreneurs. Other regions around the world, like Europe, can also boast of growing economies. With a population of about 743.5 million in 2022, twice that of the US, Europe is home to not just a large number of people but also hosts some of the largest economies in the world. Germany, for example had a GDP of $4.26 trillion in 2021, fourth worldwide with regard to nominal GDP. The 27 country European Union economic block accounts for about 14% of the world’s total trade in goods. The total value of goods and services produced in the region also amounted to €14.5 trillion in 2021. Given such statistics, the proliferation of many top-notch multinational companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) etc. into the area is not surprising.\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG), for instance, just recently cemented their European AI investments by announcing a €25M (US$26.98m) investment that is geared towards improvement in AI skills across the region. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: APPL) on the other hand, invested an additional €1 billion to expand Silicon Design Centre, earlier last year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), has also made a recent commitment to expand their cloud infrastructure to meet the demand in Europe.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit. 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to compile our list of 16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit, we base our method on residence permit received by investment as the easiest way. For this we first select Residency Programs being offered and then pick out the popular or leading Residency by Investment Programs by scouring web as well as our article. We then look at their minimum cost and application processing time and rank them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We take a weighted average for the two metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) allotted to cost and the lower to time (0.4). We present our list in a descending order of rank.\n\nNote: The figures for the approximate US Dollar amounts are based on the current exchange rate and are therefore subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n16 Easiest Countries to get a Residence Permit\n\n16. Malta\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 7\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 22\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 13\n\nOne of the popular countries for investor looking to either gain a residency or citizenship, Malta is also one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. An economically and politically sound country, the country has much to offer investors. The high quality of life to tax advantages, all have contributed to the country’s popularity for residency and investment schemes. According to the requirements of the program, the investor must have at least €500,000 (approximately US $545,000) worth of assets, €150,000 (approximately US $163,500) of which should be invested in liquid financial assets. In addition, other stipulations of the program demand property acquisition or lease as well as economic contribution to Maltese economy and donation to a non-governmental organization.

Costa Rica\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 6\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 23\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.8\n\nCosta Rica is yet another of the countries that provides easy access to residence permit. With only a US $150,000 investment-- in either property or business -- under the Investor Visa Program, one can find a way to settle down in the country. Forestry projects, however, requires only $100,000 investment. The initial residence permit issued is for two years which is then also renewable, provided the investor maintains the investment. The application process time is a bit higher than other programs, taking about 9 months.\n\n14. Cyprus\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 13\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 12.2\n\nWhile searching for a country where the residence permit can be obtained easily, Cyprus would appear as a viable option.

Canada\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 1\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 26\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 11\n\nCanada’s Start-Up Visa Program is not only the best Golden Visa program that has been attracted many an investors, but is also one of the easiest for getting a residence permit. This is primarily due to the non-existent cost of the program. Here the applicant is not required to make an investment themselves but can provide backing of accredited external investors. A C$200,000 (approximately US $148,000) commitment from a designated Canadian venture capital funds, a C$75,000 (approximately US $55,500) commitment from part of a designated Canadian angel investor groups, or a confirmation that the start-up is part of a designated Canadian business incubator program are the different options available. The application process time however, is somewhat higher in comparison to other applications.\n\n11. Panama\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 5\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 19\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.6\n\nFor people wishful to seek residence in Panama through a quick and easy way of investment, have the choice of two different visas; their Golden Visa known as the Qualified Investor Visa and their Active Investor Visa. Under the qualified investor visa the minimum investment amounts to US $100,000 in a company that has a forest registry with the Ministry of Environment. This will allow a temporary residence of two years and the application processing time is 4 months for the forestry application. Panama also offers an Active Investor Visa known as Panama’s Business Investor Residency Permit. To qualify for this scheme this investor must invest US $160,000 in a new or existing business in Panama, creating at least five full-time jobs for Panama citizens and where the investor is involved on a daily basis with the business.\n\n10. Spain\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 16\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.4\n\nA hot-spot for most expats, tourists and investors, Spain’s Golden Visa Program is set to attract foreign direct investment into the country whilst creating ease and efficiency for the investors. They have the choice to select one of the four available investment options which includes property investment, bank deposit, business and bond investment. The lowest possible investment calls for a €500,000 outlay (approximately US $545,000) in real estate on the open market. The application process is completed in about a month after which the investor is granted a temporary residence permit.\n\n9. Greece\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 10\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 10.4\n\nEurope’s one of the most popular Golden Visas, Greece provides the investors with an opportunity to make investments in various forms of avenues, ranging from as low an investment as €250,000 (approximately US $272,000) in the purchase of real estate, to as high as €800,000 (approximately US $872,000) in either corporate or government bonds. The residence permit can be renewed after every five years. The application processing time amounts to 2-4 months.\n\n8. Mauritius\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 4\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 11\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 6.8\n\nPeople wishful of gaining easy residency permit might divert their attention to Mauritius’ Residency by investment programs.

Upon applications approval which is about 2-3 months, the investor is eligible for permanent residency permit which is valid for 20 years and also renewable as long as the investment is maintained. For those whom this figure might seem a bit steep, another less costly option—the Active Investor Visa-- is also available whereby, by investing US $50,000 in a Mauritius business, a person can get residency permit. The residence permit is renewable upon expiry, contingent upon the business meeting certain performance standards.\n\n7. Italy\n\nMinimum Investment Cost Rank: 10\n\nMinimum Application Process Time Rank: 2\n\nInsider Monkey weighted Average: 6.8\n\nFor investors Italy can not only become a lucrative choice for investment due to the large EU market, but can also become one of the easiest countries to get a residence permit. There are various investment options with varying amounts required, but the minimum one demands a €250,000 (approximately US $272,000) in innovative start-ups. The country provides residence permit after 1-2 months that are needed to process the application.\n\n6.

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n“I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel’s semiconductor “fabs” in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.”\n\n10. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 27: 94.08%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 10th on our list of the best growth ETFs.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n8.

With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

        "title": "Georgia joins states seeking parental permission before children join social media",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia could join other states in requiring children younger than 16 to have their parents’ explicit permission to create social media accounts.\n\nLawmakers on Friday gave final approval to Senate Bill 351, which also would ban social media use on school devices and internet services, require porn sites to verify users are 18 or over and mandate additional education by schools on social media and internet use. The House passed the measure 120-45 and the Senate approved it 48-7.\n\nThe bill, which Republican Sen. Jason Anavitarte of Dallas called “transformative,” now goes to Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto.\n\nA number of other states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Utah passed laws last year requiring parental consent for children to use social media. In Arkansas, a federal judge in August blocked enforcement of a law requiring parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts.\n\nSome in Congress also are proposing parental consent for minors.\n\nState Rep. Scott Hilton, a Peachtree Corners Republican, argued the state should do more to limit social media use by children, saying it's causing harm.\n\n“Every rose has a thorn, and that’s social media in this generation,\" Hilton said. \"It’s great for connectivity and activism, but it has reared its ugly head on mental health.”\n\nBut opponents warned the bill would cause problems. For example, Rep. David Wilkerson, a Powder Springs Democrat, said that the ban on use of social media in schools could ban teachers from showing educationally valuable YouTube videos.\n\n“If we do pass this, we’ll be back fixing this next year, because there are too many issues with this bill,\" Wilkerson said.\n\nThe bill says social media services would have to use “commercially reasonable efforts” to verify someone's age by July 1, 2025.\n\nServices would have to treat anyone who can't be verified as a minor. Parents of children younger than 16 would have to consent to their children joining a service. Social medial companies would be limited in how they could customize ads for children younger than 16 and how much information they could collect on those children.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo comply with federal regulation, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms, but children have been shown to easily evade the bans.\n\nUp to 95% of teens aged 13 to 17 report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use them “almost constantly,” the Pew Research Center found.\n\nThe Georgia bill also aims to shut down porn sites by requiring submission of a digitized identification card or some other government-issued identification. Companies could be held liable if minors were found to access the sites, and could face fines of up to $10,000.\n\n“It will protect our children,\" said Rep. Rick Jasperse, a Jasper Republican who argues age verification will lead porn sites to cut off access to Georgians. In March, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Texas law, leading Pornhub to cut off access to Texans.\n\nThe Free Speech Coalition, which represents adult film makers, says the bill would be ineffective because users could mask their location and because people would be forced to transmit sensitive information. They also argue it's unconstitutional because there are less restrictive ways to keep children out and discriminate against certain types of speech. The coalition has sued multiple states over the laws.\n\nThe ban on school social media excludes email, news, gaming, online shopping, photograph editing and academic sites. The measure also requires a model program on the effects of social media and for students in grades 6-12, and requires existing anti-bullying programs to be updated.\n\nThe move comes after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in May that social media hasn’t been proven to be safe for young people.\n\nMurthy called on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take “immediate action to protect kids now\" and asked tech companies to share data and increase transparency and for policymakers to regulate social media for safety the way they do car seats and baby formula.\n\nMeta, the parent of Facebook and Instragram, announced in 2022 it was taking steps to verify ages. Meta says it provides “age-appropriate experiences” for teens 13-17 on Instagram, including preventing unwanted contact from unknown adults.\n\nDozens of U.S. states, including California and New York, also are suing Meta Platforms Inc., claiming the company harms young people and contributes to a youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.\n\nFlorida recently passed a law banning social media accounts for children under 14 regardless of parental consent and require parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds.",

The companies “capitalized on their knowledge that the developing child brain is particularly vulnerable and prone to manipulation by their social media products,” the district said.\n\nSimilar claims have been made by hundreds of US school districts, who are demanding social media companies pay for the cost of addiction to their platforms.\n\nNew York City sued the same companies in February, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Meta was sued by the attorneys general of more than 30 states in October. A month later, a judge in Oakland, California, ordered Meta, Google, TikTok and Snap to face hundreds of suits blaming them for hooking young people on their platforms.\n\nRead More: NYC Sues Social Media Platforms Over Teen Mental Health\n\nSpokespeople for Meta and Bytedance didn’t immediately reply to emails requesting comment on the Canadian suits. Tonya Johnson, a spokesperson for Snap, said its platform works differently than some of the others.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Snapchat opens directly to a camera – rather than a feed of content – and has no traditional public likes or comments,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.”\n\nAccording to the Canadian school boards, about half of Ontario students aren’t getting enough sleep in part because they’re hooked on the platforms, and psychological distress and body dysmorphia are commonplace. That’s forced the schools to spend millions on hiring social workers, youth counselors and other staff.\n\nIn its claim, the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board said it’s frequently the target of anonymous social media accounts “that target either students and/or staff with false allegations, hateful and/or derogatory content” that companies often fail to remove. Anonymous accounts are also the cause of more frequent bomb and shooting threats directed at schools, as well as vandalism that’s fueled by viral TikTok challenges, the board said.\n\nPeel Region is a suburban part of greater Toronto that includes the city of Mississauga.\n\nThe case is Toronto District School Board v.

        "content": "Meta will be sunsetting Facebook News in early April for users in the U.S. and Australia as the platform further deemphasizes news and politics. The feature was shut down in the U.K., France and Germany last year.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the News tab curated headlines from national and international news organizations, as well as smaller, local publications.\n\nMeta says users will still be able to view links to news articles, and news organizations will still be able to post and promote their stories and websites, as any other individual or organization can on Facebook.\n\nThe change comes as Meta tries to scale back news and political content on its platforms following years of criticism about how it handles misinformation and whether it contributes to political polarization.\n\n“This change does not impact posts from accounts people choose to follow; it impacts what the system recommends, and people can control if they want more,” said Dani Lever, a Meta spokesperson. “This announcement expands on years of work on how we approach and treat political content based on what people have told us they wanted.”\n\nMeta said the change to the News tab does not affect its fact-checking network and review of misinformation.\n\nBut misinformation remains a challenge for the company, especially as the U.S. presidential election and other races get underway.\n\n“Facebook didn’t envision itself as a political platform. It was run by tech people. And then suddenly it started scaling and they found themselves immersed in politics, and they themselves became the headline,” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy who studies tech policy and how new technologies evolve over time. “I think with many big elections coming up this year, it’s not surprising that Facebook is taking yet another step away from politics so that they can just not, inadvertently, themselves become a political headline.”\n\nRick Edmonds, media analyst for Poynter, said the dissolution of the News tab is not surprising for news organizations that have been seeing diminishing Facebook traffic to their websites for several years, spurring organizations to focus on other ways to attract an audience, such as search and newsletters.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I would say if you’ve been watching, you could see this coming, but it’s one more very hurtful thing to the business of news,” Edmonds said.\n\nNews makes up less than 3% of what users worldwide see in their Facebook feeds, Meta said, adding that the number of people using Facebook News in Australia and the U.S. dropped by over 80% last year.\n\nHowever, according to a 2023 Pew Research study, half of U.S. adults get news at least sometimes from social media. And one platform outpaces the rest: Facebook.\n\nThree in 10 U.S. adults say they regularly get news from Facebook, according to Pew, and 16% of U.S. adults say they regularly get news from Instagram, also owned by Meta.\n\nInstagram users recently expressed dissatisfaction with the app's choice to stop “proactively” recommending political content posted on accounts that users don’t follow. While the option to turn off the filter was always available in user settings, many people were not aware Meta made the change.",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\n\nThe United States economy has been hit hard by inflation concerns in the past two years, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates in a bid to curb surging prices. Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\n\nCoupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\n\nDespite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy. Benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have rocketed since the start of the new year. The former is up nearly 9% year-to-date and the latter has grown by more than 10%. Key stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also surging, the first two registering returns of 10.3% and 92% since the turn of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA prominent theme for growth this year is artificial intelligence. Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently highlighted the steps that the firm was taking to emerge as a leader in this space. During the fourth quarter earnings call, Huang called the present AI boom an inflection point that had triggered a sense of urgency at the enterprise level to develop strategies in the AI world. He cautioned, however, that the AI supercomputer infrastructure and model algorithms remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\n\n“I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software, or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and others on the way.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 20 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nBest Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\n20.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide.

Shares of integrated oil and gas company Chevron were pressured as global oil production is growing — particularly in the US, which has now surpassed its past production levels — in turn pressuring oil prices and company profit margins.”\n\n18. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions. On February 14, investment advisory Piper Sandler upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised the price target to $63 from $56.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 79 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Silver Beech Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Citigroup (“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.\n\nAs a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.\n\nCiti’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n14. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)operates as a diversified software company worldwide. On January 2, investment advisory Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and raised the price target to $705 from $650.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 4.5 million shares worth more than $2.7 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payments technology firm. On January 27, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and raised the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $26.5 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 167 in the preceding quarter worth $24.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.\n\nPeople carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they’ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren’t going to get paid…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 83\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides travel and restaurant online reservation and related services worldwide. On February 26, investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and raised the price target to $4,100 from $3,677.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), compared to 81 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor firm. On March 7, investment advisory Mizuho maintained a Buy rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and raised the price target to $235 from $200.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 111\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) markets analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products. On February 1, investment advisory RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:TMO), up from 109 in the preceding quarter worth $8.9 billion.\n\n9. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. On March 4, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock with a price target of $45.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) with 11.6 million shares worth more than $334 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.”\n\n8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 242\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 in the preceding quarter worth $35 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, SaltLight Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc., (META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”\n\n6. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets products that enable physicians and healthcare providers to enhance the quality of and access to minimally invasive care.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) provides robotic-assisted surgical solutions and invasive care through a comprehensive ecosystem of products and services. Management expects the backlog of deferred surgical procedures to take several quarters to recover, with bariatric surgery growth potentially slowing down with the increasing use of weight loss drugs.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 14 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nGrowth Outperforms in 2023 and Beyond\n\nInvesting in growth stocks is a good way to bolster your portfolio with high-profit names. Traditionally, growth stocks are companies that quickly grow their sales and earnings relative to the market, making them highly attractive to investors. But on the flipside, these stocks typically have incredibly high valuations and P/E ratios, which may discourage some investors looking for less expensive stocks. However, if you're an investor who is willing to commit to a higher valuation in exchange for quick profits and gains, growth stocks may be the best for you.\n\nLast year, growth stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. According to a Bloomberg article published this January, the S&P 500 Growth Index actually saw gains of 30% for 2023 compared to the broader benchmark index's 22% gain for the year. This performance came as a shock to many investors, considering the fact that the Federal Reserve was on a rate-hiking journey for most of the year, and traditionally, growth is expected to underperform in periods of rising interest rates. This stellar performance has resulted in growth stocks acquiring somewhat of a reliable appearance, leading to many investors in 2024 continuing to stick with their growth picks over their value counterparts.\n\nFor example, UBP's Head of Equity Research for Asia, Kieran Calder, joined Bloomberg on January 3 and stated that US growth stocks are at present a \"better bet\" for investors, with Calder himself preferring growth over value stocks in 2024. One of the major growth sectors in the market today is the technology sector with its exponential growth in light of the rise of artificial intelligence. According to Calder, for investors today, the following are the places to be in high-growth tech:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"One is the Magnificent Seven, and we think these should probably be core holdings in a portfolio, but we also expect kind of a broadening out into, let's say, software names within tech, which have underperformed over the court of last year. But we'll be able to use and get improved earnings on the back of implementation of AI, for example, and more cloud adoption. So we think that the second tier of cloud and AI names is a good place to start to look for more ideas within US tech.\"\n\nIn keeping with the above, our list of the best growth stocks to buy today also has several major tech names in it, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). For growth investors looking to identify key investment areas within tech, it would be necessary to first identify the main themes within the tech sector in terms of what will drive the sector's growth the most in 2024 and beyond. According to BlackRock Active Equity Group's Ben Bei, there are three major themes in this sector: AI, cloud computing, and electric and autonomous vehicles. These areas offer the most interesting investment opportunities for investors today and are thus worth taking a look at.\n\nSmall-Cap Growth Stocks On The Rise\n\nWhen most investors think about growth stocks, especially in the tech sector, what comes to mind is usually large or mega-cap stocks with enormous valuations and market capitalizations. However, the trend in growth stock performance this year is showing that even small-cap growth stocks are on the rise and are performing spectacularly. On February 29, Fairlead Strategies' Founder and Managing Partner, Katie Stockton, joined CNBC's \"Last Call\" to offer some insights on this development. Here's what she said:\n\n\"We've seen very concentrated outperformance in the small-cap arena from growth stocks, so more than just Supermicro and Viking Therapeutics. We have broad participation from growth more broadly and that includes a lot of biotechnology stocks, a lot of technology stocks, and I actually see that as a risk on move. A risk on indication shows an appetite for these names that previously were out of favor. You could say that about even the Russell 2000 Index, that the small-cap benchmark had been out of favor for some time. And now it's showing some signs of life and relative strength, when you compare it to the S&P 500.\"\n\nThis improvement in the performance of small-cap growth stocks alongside the usual suspects is proving to be encouraging for investors. As such, many investors are looking for some of the best growth stocks to buy, which is why we have compiled our list below. Our list of the best growth stocks includes some of the best stocks for long-term growth and some of the fastest growing technology companies in the US today. 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nA close-up of a portfolio of stocks, emphasizing the broad equity portfolio of the company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best growth stocks to invest in now, we consulted the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF.

        "content": "A Meta employee has expressed fears that an internal ban on controversial political topics is the beginning of censorship across its platforms like Instagram and Facebook, claiming she was removed from the company's systems for two months after penning concerns about the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nSaima Akhter, a New York-based data scientist at Meta, claims that she was placed \"under investigation\" and kicked out of internal systems for “speaking up for Palestine.”\n\nShe now alleges the investigation has concluded and she has returned to Meta.\n\nStaffers at Meta are banned from discussing politics, health and weapons under its “community engagement expectations (CEE).”\n\n“External censorship on Meta platforms starts with internal censorship of Meta employees,” Akhter writes in her post on Instagram.\n\n“I am continuing to push for more explanation on why and what they were investigating.\n\n\"And I am continuing to ask how employees at Meta can express their concerns to leadership and actually be heard.”\n\nThe employee signed off the post by tagging her employer: “@meta, please stop internally censoring employees and get rid of the toxic CEE.”\n\nFortune has contacted Meta and Akhter for comment.\n\nPro-Palestine voices “ignored”\n\nMeta introduced CEE at the end of 2022 “to ensure that internal discussions remain respectful,” Lori Goler, the company’s head of people at the time wrote in an internal memo viewed by Fortune.\n\n“This comes with the trade-off that we’ll no longer allow for every type of expression at work, but we think this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our internal community,\" the memo added.\n\nFrom then on, topics that had previously caused “disruption” including vaccine efficacy, abortion and gun rights were all banned overnight from being discussed in the workplace.\n\nDespite this, Akhter began openly advocating for Palestine amid its escalating conflict with Israel in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, weighed in on the war which has now claimed over 31,000 lives, calling the terrorist attacks “pure evil.”\n\n“My primary concern is the safety of our employees and their families in Israel and the surrounding region,\" Zuckerberg shared on Instagram stories.\n\nA group of Meta employees—including Akhter—then penned and circulated a letter asking Meta to \"acknowledge Palestinian lives lost\" and \"transparent action for internal and external censorship on our platforms.\"\n\n\"Internally we have been trying to raise these concerns and alarms but there is a rule that you cannot talk about disruptive topics, so anything we post about in regards to Palestine gets taken down,\" the Meta employee said in an Instagram video earlier this year before allegedly being placed “under investigation.”\n\nNow, in her latest Instagram post, she has blasted Meta’s leadership team for failing to acknowledge the hundreds of pro-Palestenian voices in the company.\n\n“The letter received nearly 500 signatures, and nearly 100 personal testimonials from employees,” she says. “Leadership deleted the letter (including deleting copies of the letter from employees drives and emails), ignored it, and never addressed it again.”\n\nCensorship on Meta\n\nIt’s not the first time that Meta has been accused of silencing pro-Palestinian posts on its platforms since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn a scathing 51-page report, Human Rights Watch blasted the social network behemoth for engaging in a “systemic and global” censorship of content in support of Palestine and Palestinians, including the taking down of posts, disabling accounts and restricting users’ ability to interact with others’ posts.\n\nMeta outlined in a blog post on its company website that it did indeed take down “more than 795,000 pieces of content” from its platform in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack because they violated the company's “Dangerous Organizations and Individuals” policy—this included posts which showed “identifiable victims at the moment of the attack” and ones praising Hamas.\n\nMeanwhile, Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King said that his Instagram account was deactivated last December after he accused Israel of genocide.\n\n“The account was disabled due to multiple instances of praise for designated entities in violation of our policies,” a Meta spokesperson explained to CNBC at the time.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "TORONTO (AP) — Four of the largest school boards in the Canadian province of Ontario said Thursday they launched lawsuits against TikTok, Meta and SnapChat alleging the social media platforms are disrupting student learning.\n\nThe lawsuits claim platforms like Facebook and Instagram are “designed for compulsive use, have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn\" and teachers have been left to manage the fallout.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. owns Facebook and Instagram, while Snap Inc. owns SnapChat and ByteDance Ltd. owns TikTok.\n\nDozens of U.S. states, including California and New York, are also suing Meta Platforms Inc. for harming young people and contributing to a youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.\n\nThe school boards in Canada suing are the Toronto District School Board, the Peel District School Board, the Toronto Catholic District School Board and the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board.\n\nThey are seeking damages for disruption to student learning and the education system.\n\n“The Defendants have acted in a high-handed, reckless, malicious, and reprehensible manner without due regard for the well-being of the student population and the education system,” according to a statement from the school boards.\n\nA spokeswoman for Snap Inc., Tonya Johnson, said Snapchat helps its users stay connected with their friends.\n\n“Snapchat opens directly to a camera — rather than a feed of content — and has no traditional public likes or comments,” she said. “While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.”\n\nRepresentatives of Meta and ByteDance didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nDuncan Embury, a lawyer for the firm representing the boards, said in the statement the most advanced tech developers in the world have knowingly and negligently designed their products to maximize the amount of time young people spend on their platforms at the expense of their wellbeing and education.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Social media companies should be held accountable for their negligence and the harm they have caused to our schools, and our community at large,” he said.\n\nThe use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Almost all teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform, with about a third saying they use social media “almost constantly,” according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn May, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy called on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take “immediate action to protect kids now” from the harms of social media.\n\nThis week, Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bil l that will ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds. It takes effect Jan. 1 and is expected to face legal challenges.",

        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia boss Jensen Huang have given the tech world the crossover no one knew they needed, complete with wardrobe swaps and gushing compliments.\n\nBut their collaboration goes deeper than an Instagram shot—their relationship is a pillar holding up the S&P500.\n\nFacebook founder Zuckerberg posted a photo with chip titan Huang captioned 'Jersey swap' on Instagram—a social media app he also owns.\n\nThe photo showed Zuckerberg wearing Huang's signature black leather jacket, while Huang donned Zuckerberg's brown-and-cream shearling coat.\n\nWith Zuckerberg's net wealth of $175 billion and Huang's $79.5 billion, the post quickly caught the imagination of followers and gained more than 151,000 likes within 24 hours of posting.\n\nWhile fans flooded to comment on the pair's outfits, the fanboying didn't stop there.\n\nReplying to one fan who was unfamiliar with Huang's identity, dad-of-three Zuckerberg replied: \"He's like Taylor Swift, but for tech.\"\n\nThe 'Taylor Swift of tech'\n\nSwift has dominated the news over the past year courtesy of her 'Eras Tour,' which saw the 'Love Story' singer become a billionaire while generating so much economic activity that Wall Street began penning notes on her activity.\n\nHuang has had a similarly stratospheric start to 2024.\n\nSo far the chipmaker's stock is up nearly 90% for the year to date with Wall Street remaining generally bullish on the continuing outlook.\n\nZuckerberg also hinted this won't be the last unexpected fashion interaction between the pair.\n\nReplying to another comment, Harvard dropout Zuckerberg said: \"I did get Jensen a black shearling coat for his collection that I'll give to him next time I see him.\"\n\nThe comment section on 'Zuck's' Instagram page also gave a tongue-in-cheek insight into what the pair might have discussed.\n\nOne user questioned whether the meet was Meta buying H100 chips—which Zuckerberg said in January he was stockpiling to a level of 340,000 by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\nBut Zuckerberg responded: \"Planning for those B100s.\"\n\nNvidia's 'Blackwell' B100 is an AI chip already being used by Amazon Web Services.\n\nWhy the Zuckerberg-Huang link-up matters\n\nThe relationship between Meta and Nvidia is mutually beneficial.\n\nFor starters, Meta is widely reported as being one of Nvidia's biggest customers.\n\nIn January, Zuckerberg indicated he was spending billions of dollars a year on H100 chips, saying his company was building a “massive compute infrastructure.”\n\nIn an Instagram reels post, he added this will include 350,000 of the Nvidia graphics cards.\n\nOn eBay, these chips sell for anywhere up to $48,000, while analysts told CNBC they expect the business is directly selling at $25,000 to $30,000.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\nHuang has also been outspoken about Meta's input into the AI race.\n\nSpeaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai earlier this year, Huang said: \"Let's face it, the single most important thing that has happened last year—if you were to ask me—the one, single, most important event last year and how it has activated AI researchers here in this region is actually Llama 2.\"\n\nLlama 2 is Meta's open source large language model, which is available for free for both research and commercial use.\n\nAnd while Huang has signposted Meta's contribution to the sector, Zuckerberg's confidence in a supply of chips—a concern for many tech businesses—will also allow him to deliver on the AI promises that have boosted Wall Street's confidence in the business.\n\nZuckerberg's wealth has soared since he took a step back from his metaverse dream to focus on AI technology.\n\nFor Meta’s largest individual shareholder, a combination of a 2023 “year of efficiency” and making AI the company’s priority resulted in a near–$40 billion boost last year.\n\nIndeed, in February the term “AI” was used more than 80 times by Meta staffers on the call—a move that has proved something of a surefire way to pique the interest of investors.\n\nCourtesy of the positive picture Zuckerberg and his team had for analysts—and the clear show of focus on the emerging technology—Meta’s share price shot up 20% in the hours following the announcement.\n\nThe support between the pair comes at the very top of the stock market: the couple are two of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, the Herculean shares that have held up the S&P500 in recent years.\n\nThis smooth relationship between the two has contributed to confidence among investors and share price gains for both—Meta is up 42% in the year to date—meaning the multi-billion dollar bromance may go far deeper than outwear.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Is there any reason to mess around with investing? To take a flyer on a no-name stock? To gamble with your next egg? Or is it better to put your hard-earned money into top-rated stocks to buy?\n\nCount me in for the latter.\n\nGranted, there’s nothing wrong with investing a little money in a speculative choice. But if you’re serious about making money and investing your dollars in choices that give you the best opportunity to beat the market, you can’t do better than top-rated stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe rating system we’ll use is the Portfolio Grader, which makes identifying top-rated stocks to buy pretty easy. The Portfolio Grader evaluates every stock in the market based on momentum, earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and other factors. Top-rated stocks to buy get “A” ratings, which is what you’ll see on this list.\n\nAnd if you find a stock in your portfolio with a “D” or “F” grade, it’s time to sell it and pick up one of these top-rated stocks to buy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the king of top-rated stocks to buy for a year now. And why not? The semiconductor company makes most graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most advanced artificial intelligence applications in the world.\n\nNVDA stock grew by 239% in 2023 as its valuation jumped to more than $2 trillion, making it the world’s third-most valuable publicly traded company. Revenues also jumped, from $26 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024. Earnings per share jumped from $1.74 to $11.93.\n\nAnd there’s plenty more to come. Even though other semiconductor companies are making inroads to compete with Nvidia’s chips, NVDA has a huge head start. And it now has tons of cash to help it maintain its advantage through research and development, expansion or acquisitions.\n\nOn top of that, the AI chip market will only grow, with projections coming in at a market value of $119.4 billion by 2027 — a 123.4% increase from 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock will continue to be a winner and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a technology company that’s long used AI to help it land government contracts.\n\nIt contracts with military and intelligence agencies to provide real-time data analysis that helps soldiers in the field and officers in the Pentagon to do their jobs.\n\nBut Palantir is also building out its commercial side. Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million.\n\nBy contrast, Palantir’s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%. The number will improve, especially since Palantir won a $178.4 million Army contract. It will build a system to provide the Army with deep-sensing capability enabled by AI and machine learning.\n\nPalantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP, can be used for both defense and commercial clients. That bodes well for future growth.\n\nPLTR stock is up 44% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has grown so much that it makes Nvidia look like an underperforming company if that’s possible. SMCI stock is up 260% so far this year and 824% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe driving force behind Supermicro’s growth is tied to Nvidia and other companies that are working with AI. Super Micro develops storage and server solutions that can be custom-built for its clients. Its products are ideal for pairing the massive number of GPUs needed to run advanced AI and generative AI applications.\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $3.66 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. Income of $295.9 million and $5.47 per share was a sharp increase from a year ago, when Supermicro brought in $176.1 million in revenue and $3.31 per share.\n\nSMCI stock is a great way to invest in AI while diversifying away from chipmakers. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a great comeback story. The owner of Facebook and Instagram saw its stock drop sharply in 2022 as it invested billions of dollars into CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse. That spending coincided with a drop in advertising that rocked META stock.\n\nBut over the last 12 months, Zuckerburg’s company turned its fortunes around. Meta began refocusing on growth and the bottom line, reducing head count and expenses while investing more in the core business. It launched its Threads app as a direct rival to X, the company formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAnd engagement grew as Meta counted 3.98 billion monthly users on its apps in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 6% from a year ago. Revenue also climbed by 25% in the last year, reaching $40.1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta is also heavily investing in AI, which it will use for public-facing features and to make its advertising more effective. It recently unveiled two new GPU clusters that Meta says are “a port of our larger road map for the future of AI.”\n\nMETA stock is up 40% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a top play in the retail sector. The Arkansas company is the biggest retail company in the world.\n\nWMT continues to see strong growth as it dominates both the grocery and the home goods sector with its ubiquitous supercenters.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was $173.4 million, up 5.7% from a year ago. The jump was thanks to a 4% increase in sales driven by increased customer traffic.\n\nWalmart recorded $648.1 billion in revenue for the full year, up 6% from 2022. Income of $6.6 billion was a 32.2% increase from a year ago.\n\nWalmart remains popular because of its size and footprint. It has more than 10,800 locations. By its sheer size, Walmart can squeeze suppliers to get exclusive or reduced pricing that it can pass on to its customers to beat competitors.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce sales also grew by 23% in 2023, reaching more than $100 billion for the year.\n\nWMT stock is up 15% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDorian LPG (LPG) Ship tanker gas LPG, Aerial view Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) tanker, Tanker ship logistic and transportation business oil and gas industry, Loading arm oil and gas offshore platforms.\n\nSource: Avigator Fortuner / Shutterstock.com\n\nDorian LPG (NYSE:LPG) isn’t as flashy as some of the other names on this list. But there’s nothing wrong with investing in the energy sector — particularly when you’re finding top-rated stocks to buy such as LPG.\n\nDorian LPG is a liquified petroleum gas shipping company that operates 26 modern very large gas carriers, or VLGCs, with a capacity of 2.1 million cubic meters.\n\nDorian’s ships move liquified petroleum around the world, taking to suppliers who in turn sell to customers who operate portable heaters, gas ovens, barbecue grills and gas fireplaces.\n\nDorian reported a time charter equivalent rate of $76,337 per operating day in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), which helped it earn revenues of $163.1 million. That was up from $103.3 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nLPG also offers an oversized dividend yield of 10.8%. The stock has increased 83% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) makes laptop and desktop computers, notebooks, and mobile devices. But the company also has ambitious AI plans, including a generative AI platform that helps its customers generate better predictions and analyze data.\n\nOrders for the company’s AI-optimized servers increased by 40% in the fourth quarter. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke says customers demand personal computers and servers with AI capabilities. “We have positioned ourselves well in AI,” he told analysts.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Feb. 2, 2024) was $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But analysts and investors are clearly betting that DELL will turn those numbers around this calendar year.\n\nDELL stock is up 200% in the last 12 months and 49% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, SMCI and LNG.

        "content": "Wednesday, March 27, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), S&P Global Inc. (SPGI) and AT&T Inc. (T). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+63.3% vs. +39.4%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nS&P Global’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+26.7% vs. +23.9%). The company remains well-poised to gain from the growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products.\r\n\r\nNew service launches have been aiding the company's growth. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors' confidence and positively impact earnings per share.\r\n\r\nHowever, S&P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries concerning the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio does not bode well for the company.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on S&P Global here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AT&T have gained +18.5% over the past six months against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s gain of +19.9%. The company has offered a muted outlook for 2024 owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Dwindling contribution from DirecTV business is a concern.\r\n\r\nAT&T is facing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services. As it tries to woo customers with discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to escalate. However, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans driven by a customer-centric business model.\r\n\r\nThe deployment of Open RAN architecture, which offers more flexibility, lowers costs and helps to monetize the network, is likely to reap long-term benefits. An integrated fiber expansion strategy is expected to improve broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include RTX Corp. (RTX), CME Group Inc. (CME) and FedEx Corp. (FDX).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.09 indicates a change of +15.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $36.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.9%. The $158.75 billion and $179.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.7% and +13.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best momentum ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nWhat is Momentum Investing?\n\nMomentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future.\n\nMomentum Gaining Momentum\n\nThe renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s“Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joinedCNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’.\n\nHowever, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on 'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing. Although, the rebalance at the end of Q1 2024 could pose a risk to momentum followers.\n\nSome of the top momentum stocks to buy include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, we discuss the best momentum ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best momentum ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\nA view of the hustle and bustle of trading activity on a busy trading floor.\n\nBest Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\n10. Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 74.06%\n\nInvesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) is based on the Dorsey Wright Technical Leaders Index, comprising about 100 US companies from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. It utilizes a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC to select firms showing strong relative strength characteristics. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) expense ratio came in at 0.62%. The fund was launched on March 1, 2007. It ranks 10th on our list of the best momentum ETFs.\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the top holdings of Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP). It is a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. On February 7, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $9.26, beating market estimates by $0.05, and a revenue of $3.83 billion, missing Street consensus by $30 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the best momentum stocks to invest in.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) was also a bottom contributor to portfolio performance. The Company reported +11% sales growth for the quarter, driven by a +17% increase in sales to professional service providers, leading to +12% growth in operating income and +17% increase in earnings per share. The Company – true to its long capital allocation culture – has aggressively bought back shares over the past 12 months. O’Reilly Automotive’s professional sales segment continues to dramatically outpace its publicly traded competitors. The Company has a mostly singular focus on the United States, whereas several of its competitors have diverted their attention away from the large and fragmented U.S. professional market, toward non-U.S. or non-automotive markets. In the short-term, investors are focused on the mild weather that has unfolded during the late fall and early winter of 2023. Mild weather often leads to temporary slowdowns in sales growth for auto parts, but we would look to take advantage of that because O’Reilly’s long-term competitive positioning and extraordinary returns on capital are well-entrenched.”\n\n9. Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 76.65%\n\nInvesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS) tracks the Dorsey Wright SmallCap Technical Leaders Index, which selects approximately 200 companies based on their market performance and relative strength characteristics according to a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC. These companies are chosen from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS)’s expense ratio came in at 0.60%. It is one of the best momentum ETFs to buy.\n\nModine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) is the largest holding of Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS). The company specializes in providing engineered heat transfer systems and components for OEM vehicular applications. On March 19, Oppenheimer assigned an Outperform rating to Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) and set a price target of $105. Analyst Noah Kaye highlighted Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD)’s expansion into data centers and diversification as drivers for potential positive earnings revisions.

Fidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 78.85%\n\nFidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO) ranks 8th on our list of the best momentum ETFs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) to produce 48 million iPhone units in Q1 2024, marking a 14% year-over-year decrease, with a further decline to 39 million units in Q2, representing a 7% drop compared to the previous year.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\n7. Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 88.24%\n\nInvesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM) tracks the S&P 600 High Momentum Value Index, which comprises 120 securities from the S&P SmallCap 600 Index with the highest combined \"value scores\" and \"momentum scores\". Constituents of the index are weighted based on their value scores, with higher scores receiving greater weights. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM)’s expense ratio stood at 0.36%. It is one of the best momentum ETFs to buy.\n\nKelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) is the top holding of Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM). Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) offers workforce solutions across different industries through its five segments – Professional & Industrial, Science, Engineering & Technology, Education, Outsourcing & Consulting, and International. On February 15, Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.93 and a revenue of $1.23 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.37 and $10 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 14 hedge funds were bullish on Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA), compared to 10 funds in the last quarter.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) is one of the top stocks for momentum investors.\n\nHere is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n6. Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 90.11%\n\nVanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) employs a rules-based quantitative model to assess US common stocks, focusing on those with robust recent performance. The fund's portfolio encompasses a range of stocks across different market capitalizations, market sectors, and industry groups. Its benchmark is the Russell 3000 Index. Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) is one of the best momentum ETFs to monitor.

(NASDAQ:META) is the largest holding of Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO). On March 18, Mizuho Securities added Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as a top pick, maintaining a Buy rating and a $575 price target on the shares. Analyst James Lee predicts stron\n\ng revenue growth for the company in fiscal 2024, driven by improvements in Reels monetization, geographic expansion, Amazon partnership with Shops, and optimized video placements. Long-term investments in WhatsApp, generative AI, and Llama could also lead to a significant increase in revenue per user.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 242 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 funds in the last quarter.\n\nSequoia Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Two additional trims, in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Carmax, were more substantive in nature. When Meta’s stock declined in 2022, we judged it to be significantly mispriced and held our ground through the bottom. We trimmed the position serially last year as the stock soared because we were wary of holding a large position exposed to significant regulatory risks, particularly in Europe. We are comfortable owning Meta at today’s much-reduced weighting and current valuation. The smaller position size reflects our updated assessment of the balance of long-term risk versus reward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 States That Produce the Most Renewable Energy in the US 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2024 14 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "If There Were a \"Magnificent Seven\" Purely for AI Stocks, These Would Be My Top Picks",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" includes some of the largest tech-oriented companies. But not every Magnificent Seven component could be considered a true artificial intelligence (AI) play.\n\nIf there were a new Magnificent Seven purely for AI stocks, then I would keep Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), but swap out Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla for Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), and Deere (NYSE: DE).\n\nHere's why these seven companies are all excellent ways to invest in AI from various industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe poster child of the AI craze, Nvidia's growth is mostly due to sales to data centers. Faster and more secure processing power is needed to support complex AI solutions. And that's exactly what Nvidia is giving the industry.\n\nThe greatest risk to Nvidia is a slowdown in demand from its data center business. Operating income from its compute and networking segment (led by data centers) increased more than sixfold between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n\nIf demand slows, the growth could shrink as fast as it rose. However, an extreme slowdown is unlikely if AI investments pay off for Nvidia's customers.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms plans to spend $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024. To quote Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call:\n\nCompanies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation, and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.\n\nMeta is leveraging AI to boost user engagement, improve its algorithm, and better align ads to interested users. Instagram has become arguably the most valuable digital real estate in the world, and will likely stay that way thanks to Meta's AI investments.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe third and final Magnificent Seven stock that also deserves to be in the AI Magnificent Seven is Microsoft. The company's results show how AI can improve performance and accelerate growth even from established solutions.\n\nMicrosoft Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, Azure AI, and more are some of the many ways Microsoft uses AI to improve solutions without breaking what already works.\n\nMicrosoft makes so much money that it can invest in AI, fund its long-term growth, and still have plenty of cash to buy back stock and raise its dividend. The company is positioned to continue monetizing AI across business-to-business and business-to-consumer platforms.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAMD often traded in tandem with Nvidia, but the company is actually quite different. For one, AMD isn't growing as fast -- yet. However, optimistic investors believe it can unlock explosive growth by competing with Nvidia in the GPU market for AI applications and CPUs for AI-enabled PCs.\n\nIn 2023, data center revenue grew just 7.5% year over year and made up less than 29% of total revenue. So while AMD's growth is expected to happen, Nvidia's growth is occurring right now.\n\nAMD will have to deliver to justify its lofty valuation, but it's certainly one of the most innovative and exciting AI plays out there for risk-tolerant investors.\n\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly known as TSMC, is perhaps the safest way to invest in the AI-fueled semiconductor space.\n\nTSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and others. It's a similar dynamic to Apple, which designs its products but relies on its suppliers for materials, manufacturing, and assembly.\n\nWhile these suppliers are usually low-margin, high-volume businesses, TSMC fabs handle some of the most complex and precise workflows in the world. TSMC is compensated accordingly, with an operating margin that has mostly ranged from 35% to 50% over the last decade -- far higher than your typical manufacturer.\n\nIn this vein, TSMC wins as long as chip demand goes up. It doesn't matter if AMD takes market share from Nvidia, so long as the industry is growing.\n\nTSMC is not nearly as expensive as other top chip stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.7. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n6. Adobe\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Adobe's growth was slowing. Subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models are great for their consistent revenue. However, innovation and product improvements are needed to retain and grow the customer base, as well as justify price increases. AI has opened the door to some of Adobe's biggest leaps in years.\n\nAbout a year ago, Adobe released Firefly, its generative AI tool for Creative Cloud, and many other products. The impact is already visible in Adobe's numbers, but the company is spending a lot of money to roll out these tools, which is straining profits.\n\nAdobe is in customer acquisition mode, hoping to boost Firefly users and grow engagement as quickly as possible. It's a good long-term strategy that focuses on where Adobe could be several years from now, not on where it is today. Patient investors may want to consider buying Adobe now, with the understanding that Wall Street may sell the stock if Adobe puts up weak quarterly results.\n\n7. Deere\n\nYou may be wondering how we went from hypergrowth chip stocks to a tractor company. Well, part of the reason was to spice up the list with something outside the tech sector. Deere is a sleeper AI play -- and has been for some time now.\n\nDeere released its Smart Industrial strategy in 2022. And it's already having an impact on its results. The company is betting that farms will become increasingly automated in the future. Examples would include automated crop spacing, how much fertilizer to use and where, and even a fully autonomous tractor.\n\nBuzzwords aside, the idea is to use technology to lower costs and boost crop yield. It doesn't really matter how it's packaged, so long as these tools are boosting business for Deere's customers.\n\nAI can benefit farm sustainability and efficiency, and Deere is one of the easiest ways to invest in that trend.\n\nInvest in AI in a way that's right for you\n\nFrom obvious plays like Nvidia to a well-known legacy brand like Deere, companies across industries are investing in AI to accelerate growth. Every industry is up for disruption. Some changes will happen gradually. Others could happen sooner than expected.\n\nThe key is investing in what you understand and with a long-term mindset. Companies that are boosting research and development and capital expenditures may not see a return on that investment for some time. Meanwhile, other hot stocks like Nvidia will eventually reach a cyclical slowdown that has nothing to do with the core investment thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. policy chief Nick Clegg warned US government officials that limiting companies from sharing certain artificial intelligence technologies publicly could harm American influence over the relatively new and evolving global AI industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Japan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990 Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Using Your Premium Credit Card May Cost More After Visa-Mastercard Deal\n\nIn public comments submitted Wednesday to the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Meta wrote that a “restrictive approach” to sharing AI models may mean that technologies developed in other countries “become the global norm.”\n\n“It’s not as if that vacuum is not going to be filled by others,” Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said in an interview. “Open-sourcing is actually the way you export US values and technology.” The public input from Meta, the parent of social media apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, was shared with the White House after an open request for comment last month by the Biden administration, which is considering how to regulate AI technology.\n\nMajor players in the AI industry disagree about whether the programming and data behind artificial intelligence models should be public and open, or held more closely as proprietary information. Startup OpenAI, one of the industry’s early leaders, has been in favor of keeping its technology private, while Meta and some other major tech giants, like GitHub owner Microsoft Corp., have been in favor of open-sourcing at least some AI code.\n\nMeta’s argument for keeping the technology open may resonate with the current presidential administration and Congress. For years, efforts to pass legislation that restricts technology companies’ business practices have all died in Congress, including bills meant to protect children on social media, to limit tech giants from unfairly boosting their own products, and to safeguard users’ data online.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut other bills aimed at protecting American business interests have had more success, including the Chips and Science Act, passed in 2022 to support US chipmakers while addressing national security concerns around semiconductor manufacturing. Another bill targeting Chinese tech giant ByteDance Ltd. and its popular social network, TikTok, is awaiting a vote in the Senate after passing in the House earlier this month.\n\nMeta, based in Menlo Park, California, has been one of the technology industry’s most vocal proponents of federal AI regulation, including rules to protect against deepfakes. Clegg said he’s optimistic that the government will act to develop rules around AI, despite lawmakers’ failure to agree on many other issues.\n\nThe technology industry has been largely unregulated since Meta’s founding in 2004 — a reality that has led to questions about whether the biggest companies have been allowed to amass too much power. “I think there’s sort of a feeling of like, ‘Let’s not let this happen again,’” Clegg said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Hong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn’t Classified\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Some growth-oriented corporations aren’t profitable quite yet, which poses more risks but can lead to a higher potential upside.\n\nWhile speculating on those types of growth stocks can lead to high returns, it’s less risky to focus on growth stocks that have already proven their business models. These corporations generate positive earnings instead of relying on shareholder dilution and capital from other sources to make ends meet.

Revenue increased by 25% YoY while net income more than tripled during that timeframe. Each platform is attracting more daily active users.

The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\n\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government’s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products — including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps — on the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook In China last Sunday. (Wu Hao/Pool Photo via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone’s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneiner said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument \"I think they win.\"\n\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company’s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\n\"Apple does have more security, because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneiner said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\n\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneiner.\n\n\"Don’t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\n\nThe hurdles DOJ must overcome\n\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\n\"I think it’s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple’s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\n\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olsen.\n\nTo overcome those limits, Olsen said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law. Apple has a dominant share of the US smartphone market. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/file photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olsen explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\n\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\n\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\n\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that’s problematic?” Picker said.\n\nThe government’s answer is that Apple’s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products – like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\n\nA 'pretty hard case'\n\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than to harm them.\n\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega popular gaming app “Fortnite,” Epic Games. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. (Photo by Philip Pacheco/Getty Images) (Philip Pacheco via Getty Images)\n\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\n\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\n\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olsen said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olsen said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Could Become a Penny Stock",
        "content": "Snap (NYSE:SNAP) may be heading toward penny stock status. Back in December, I urged investors to consider exiting their positions at $15.90 due to an unjustified surge in the stock. Fast-forward to today, with Snap trading at $11.31, and my bearish outlook on Snap has only deepened. Following continuous operating losses and a lack of substantial free cash flow generation to justify its current valuation, Snap seems poised to keep deteriorating shareholder value, inevitably inching closer to penny stock status.\n\nSnap’s Growth Stalls as Peers Surge\n\nThe first factor fueling my bearish stance on Snap is its stagnant growth in a landscape where its peers thrive and deliver great results. Assuming Snap was growing rapidly, I could go easier on the company’s disastrous profitability (more on that later). However, with top-line growth having halted, I see no way for the company to come out of its current predicament.\n\nTo illustrate, Snap’s revenues came in at $4.6 billion in FY 2023, flat compared to the previous year. This result is quite underwhelming in itself because Snap’s revenue growth stagnated during a rather favorable advertising environment. In fact, many of its peers in the social media and content-sharing area recorded significantly higher revenues during the same period.\n\nFor instance, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted revenue growth of 16% last year, while Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube also grew its revenues by 16% in this period. Even Pinterest, whose growth tends to underperform, grew its top line by 9% in FY 2023.\n\nThe company may highlight its platform’s ongoing user growth, with Snap’s daily active users rising to 414 million globally in Q4—marking a 10% increase. However, this narrative merely scratches the surface. Notably, this expansion is primarily attributed to a 19% surge in users from the rest-of-the-world regions (i.e., all regions outside North America and Europe). Source: SNAP’s Q4-2023 Investor Presentation\n\nThe problem is that RoW user growth has little to no value, as these users can hardly be monetized. It is actually North America and Europe that can drive ad revenue, as their users have tremendously higher purchasing power. In the meantime, Snap even lost about one million users quarter-over-quarter in North America, further dampening its user mix. Therefore, despite the seemingly growing user base, Snap’s revenue per user (ARPU) fell by 5% in Q4, partially offsetting revenue gains from user growth.\n\nStory continues Source: SNAP’s Q4-2023 Investor Presentation\n\nSnap’s quarterly reports have consistently highlighted advertisers’ hesitation to spend big on its platform relative to its competitors, likely largely due to the lack of impactful conversion metrics. Thus, given that Snap posted a decline in ARPU in a vigorous advertising environment, it’s reasonable to expect that the moment global ad spending loses its current steam in line with its cyclical fashion, Snap’s revenues could plummet from here.\n\nOperating Losses Persist & Free Cash Flow Isn’t a Good Indicator\n\nWith Snap lacking meaningful revenue growth to improve its profitability prospects, its operating losses are likely to persist. At the same, the company’s seemingly growing free cash flow model isn’t a good indicator of the stock’s prospects, as Snap’s stock-based compensation (SBC) keeps deteriorating shareholder value. Let’s take a deeper look.\n\nAs you can see below, with total costs and expenses surpassing Snap’s revenues, FY 2023 marked another year of steep operating losses, reaching $1.4 billion.\n\nSnap may defend its position in that regard by citing its “growing” free cash flow. In fact, management celebrated FY 2023 as Snap’s third consecutive year of positive free cash flow. However, Snap’s free cash flow should be highly scrutinized. Take a look at Snap’s FY 2023 statements. You will find that while free cash flow came in came in at roughly $35 million, this number includes a huge $1.3 billion in stock-based compensation expenses added back during the reconciliation process.\n\nTherefore, while it may seem that Snap “creates value” due to its positive free cash flow, the rate at which it dilutes shareholders (with FY 2023’s SBC equal to about 7% of the current market cap) more than offsets the rate at which value is created by a wide margin.\n\nIn my view, this trend appears poised to persist, steadily chipping away at shareholders’ equity per share, resulting in increasing dilution and, thus, a declining share price. This trajectory will potentially drive Snap toward penny stock territory. With no apparent catalysts for revenue growth and a persistent struggle to control expenses, the course seems irreversible.\n\nThis process could even accelerate if ARPU keeps falling, which I find increasingly likely, given the company’s lackluster performance during a favorable ad environment.\n\nIs SNAP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street seems to have mixed feelings about the stock, as SNAP features a Hold consensus rating based on nine Buys, 22 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. At $13.98 per share, the average SNAP stock price target suggests 23.6% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SNAP stock, the most accurate analyst following the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Ross Sandler from Barclays. He boasts an average return of 43.94% per rating and a 57% success rate.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I understand that suggesting Snap is headed towards penny stock territory may appear audacious. Nonetheless, from my perspective, it seems increasingly inevitable.\n\nDespite management’s attempts to highlight growing user numbers and positive free cash flow, the company faces significant hurdles. Stalled revenue growth, troubled by a decline in ARPU and persistent operating losses, paints a bleak picture.\n\nWith competitors surging and advertisers hesitant to spend their hard-earned dollars on Snap’s platform, it’s only reasonable to expect the company’s metrics to worsen further, particularly once global ad spending takes a breather, which could accelerate the erosion in shareholder value.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Meta would love to avoid politics, but politics won’t go away",
        "content": "It’s kind of hard to steer clear of politics when your biggest services are used by billions of people, but Meta is giving it a shot anyway.\n\nLast week, the company made good on a February promise to stop recommending political content to its Instagram and Threads users, when the content comes from accounts those users don’t already follow. Users can still choose to be recommended strangers’ political content if they find the correct setting, The Guardian reports, but otherwise, the default is to not see it. Facebook users will get the same default setting at some point, but not yet.\n\nSo, what is “political content” anyway? Meta is somewhat vague on that point, noting that it is content that is “potentially related to things like laws, elections, or social topics,” which are apparently hindering Instagram and Threads from being “a great experience for everyone.”\n\nOn the one hand, this newly implemented policy feels like a good way to ward off the rabbit holes toward extremism that platforms like Instagram sometimes create. It should also go some way toward stemming the spread of disinformation, which gets Meta so much grief from lawmakers and regulators.\n\nCounterpoint: Those definitions of “political” are awfully blurry and suggest a future where people are discouraged from sharing ideas on topics of real substance. It’s really hard to please everyone when it comes to this stuff.\n\nAgain, Meta may try to shun politics, but politics will always find it. The latest example of that is a recommendation issued today by the company’s independent Oversight Board, regarding its policy about the Arabic term “shaheed,” which means “martyr” in general usage, though it also means “witness” in Qur’anic Arabic.\n\nMeta’s policy is to ban the word when used in reference to what it classifies as a dangerous individual or organization, as it views this as praise in this context. In March 2023, following years of deliberation, the company asked for the Oversight Board’s opinion on the policy, and this morning got it—the opinion would have come late last year if it weren’t for the Gaza war breaking out and necessitating a pause.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the Oversight Board, Meta’s “shaheed” policy is “overbroad, and disproportionately restricts freedom of expression and civic discourse.” It leads to the removal of posts that are merely reporting on violence and dangerous entities, and “all too often” leads to the censoring of Muslim users’ posts (the word has made its way into non-Arabic languages, too). So, the board recommended that Meta stop presuming that the word “shaheed” always equates to glorification when used in relation to a dangerous entity, and should only block the content when there’s also some other signal of violence, like a picture of a weapon or a statement advocating a violent act.\n\nMeta said in an emailed statement that it would respond to the recommendation—the Oversight Board can’t tell Meta what to do, except when adjudicating specific content-moderation cases—within 60 days. “We want people to be able to use our platforms to share their views, and have a set of policies to help them do so safely,” said Meta’s spokesperson. “We aim to apply these policies fairly but doing so at scale brings global challenges.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just a trendy technology that fails to live up to the hype, like 3D printing is. AI has already been integrated into many products for years, but the mainstream public is just now catching on.\n\nAI fundamentally shifts how we interact and work. As a result, investors need to be aware of many of the long-term winners in this space and position their portfolios accordingly.\n\nSo if you have $3,000 to invest (or any amount, for that matter), consider splitting it up among these stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nWhen looking for companies to buy and never sell, it's crucial to find businesses with a sticky product or service that can quickly pivot to stay at the top.\n\nOne such company is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the owner of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Meta is deploying AI in multiple ways, including how we communicate with those who don't speak the same language.\n\nSocial media products are also benefiting from AI on the business side, as it helps create ads catered to individuals. Over the long term, this will likely increase the cost per ad due to their efficiency, and Meta profits from this rise. For example, Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta's Head of Global Business Group, stated ads that utilized AI saw a return of spending increase of 32% from ad viewers. With Meta's ads becoming more effective, it's only a matter of time before costs start to rise\n\nLastly, its Reality Labs division is working on its Ego model and glasses, which could help bring technology like augmented reality, currently used for games or other leisure activities, to training aids, allowing users to learn a new skill.\n\nMeta is at the forefront of AI, making it a fantastic stock to buy and stash away. With the stock trading for 25.5 times forward earnings and posting 25% revenue growth, it's operating at a high level and reasonably priced.\n\n2. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) has digital design products that are the industry standard. But for Adobe to continue growing, it must adopt AI, and it already has.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts Firefly tool gives users the power to create images using AI and can significantly reduce the cost and time needed to create media. For example, IBM used Firefly to generate 200 campaign assets with 1,000 variations in moments rather than the months it might have taken to do them individually. These generated images were also quite successful: The advertising campaign had 26 times higher engagement than its benchmark.\n\nThese kinds of success stories excite me as an investor, since they demonstrate Adobe's prowess in the digital media space.\n\nGetting existing customers to add on offerings like Firefly is a key part of the Adobe investment thesis, as it already has a strong foothold in its target audience. Without new products, it would need to rely on hiking the subscription fees every year to drive growth. While Firefly is an important part of this expansion, other products and functionalities also played a role in Adobe growing its Q1 FY 2024 (ending March 1) revenue by 11%. Combined with the effects of stock buybacks, this would have allowed Adobe to grow its net income by 30% if it didn't have a $1 billion charge from an acquisition breakup fee.\n\nWith AI already affecting how media is created, it's crucial to invest in a company like Adobe, which is at the forefront of this shift.\n\n3. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is vital to the development of AI models because it requires a vast amount of information to make these models accurate, and collecting and storing that can be problematic without the right tools.\n\nSnowflake allows businesses of all sizes to capture, store, and use data through its data cloud platform. And if a company has a dataset it wants to sell to another company that's creating an AI model, it can do so on the Snowflake Marketplace.\n\nSo Snowflake is a key company in this space, and regardless of how widely AI is adopted, the importance of having a way to collect and store data will never go away.\n\nThis makes Snowflake a great stock to buy and hold because it will continue to grow for years with the constant need to collect and process information to feed models.\n\nSnowflake's recent results show how strong the company is, with its product revenue growing 33% to $738 million in Q4 FY 2024 (ending January 31). For FY 2025, it expects 22% growth which highlights a continued demand for its product. With the stock trading around its all-time low price-to-sales valuation, it makes for a smart buy.\n\nBuying now and holding for at least five years is a wise decision for all three of these companies. They have high long-term prospects, making them excellent choices over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 198% in five years. It's also good to see the share price up 42% over the last quarter.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Meta Platforms managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 24% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Meta Platforms shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 148% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 24% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Are Considerably Cheaper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend has changed the corporate landscape more than the advent of the internet. However, the arrival of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may give history a run for its money.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be delegated to humans. The incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to \"learn\" over time and become more proficient at their tasks, is what ultimately gives AI utility in practically every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock has soared thanks to the AI revolution\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the span of a little over one year, it's become the foundational-infrastructure play in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for a greater-than 90% share of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia is still in the process of ramping its production. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should help ease supply chain issues for Nvidia and allow the company to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they usually are.\n\nIn addition to contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own to either complement or replace Nvidia's data-center infrastructure. Even if Nvidia is able to maintain some degree of advantage(s) over these in-house GPUs from its top customers, future orders from these four businesses are liable to taper.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia finds itself at risk of cannibalizing its own gross margin as it expands production. The reason data-center sales more than tripled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) is because of GPU scarcity. Demand was so strong for its A100 and H100 chips that the company was able to dramatically increase the price of these units. As Nvidia's GPU production, and that of its competition, increases, industrywide GPU scarcity and Nvidia's pricing power should wane.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the most damning factor of all might be Nvidia's valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget Nvidia: These two \"Magnificent Seven\" components are considerably cheaper\n\nThere are a number of ways to \"value\" stocks. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works well for mature businesses, it doesn't do a particularly good job of valuing the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's largest and most influential businesses (listed in order of descending market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia  Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven businesses offer well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in their respective industries. They're also well known for reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. That's why cash flow tends to be the best measure of value when analyzing Nvidia and its peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs of the closing bell on March 22, Nvidia was valued at just north of 30 times Wall Street's forward-year cash-flow estimates. That makes Nvidia the priciest stock within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe good news for investors is that two other Magnificent Seven components with artificial intelligence ties are historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus cash-flow forecasts, Alphabet is expected to generate more than $11 in cash flow per share in 2025. Based on its closing price for March 22, this places Alphabet at roughly 13.5 times forward-year cash flow. Not only is this less than half the multiple Nvidia trades at, but it represents a roughly 24% discount to Alphabet's price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe operating segment that makes Alphabet tick is Google. In February, Google registered a 91.6% share of worldwide internet search, according to GlobalStats. It's sustained at least a 90% monthly share of global search dating back nine years. Being the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s), it suggests Google should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut it's Alphabet's cloud-infrastructure service platform, Google Cloud, which offers the most promise in terms of cash-flow growth. Google Cloud accounted for a 10% share of global cloud-infrastructure service spend during the September-ended quarter, and this segment delivered its first year of profits in 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also where Alphabet has many of its artificial intelligence tie-ins. It's allowing customers to use generative AI solutions to build applications within the cloud that can improve customer interactions and/or help businesses better target consumers with their advertising.\n\nEnterprise cloud spending looks to be in its early stages of ramping up, which suggests double-digit sales growth can continue for the higher-margin Google Cloud.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably cheaper AI stock than Nvidia is none other than e-commerce titan Amazon.\n\nDespite hitting a fresh 52-week high last week, Amazon ended March 22 at a multiple of only 13 times Wall Street's estimated forward-year cash flow. This represents a 43% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and it's markedly lower then Nvidia's multiple-to-forward-year cash flow.\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online retail platform. The company's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year, which was more than 31 percentage points above its next-closest competitor.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find that online retail sales generate low margins and don't contribute much to Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Rather, the company's ancillary operating segments, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhereas Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global cloud-infrastructure service spending, AWS sits at the top of the pecking order with a 31% share, according to estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is deploying generative AI solutions in a multitude of ways within its cloud platform to allow users to build applications. On an annualized run-rate basis, AWS is generating nearly $97 billion in sales and is consistently responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon's other ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Luring more than 2 billion unique users to its website each month has fueled ad sales for Amazon. Likewise, it crossed above 200 million monthly worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of the National Football League for Thursday Night Football.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.27%.\n\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 5.28% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.05%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. On that day, Meta Platforms is projected to report earnings of $4.27 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 61.74%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $36.07 billion, indicating a 25.94% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $19.94 per share and a revenue of $158.75 billion, indicating changes of +34.1% and +17.68%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

If you want to skip our discussion on the tech landscape, head over to Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, resulting in softer consumer spending, reduced product demand, market capitalization declines, and workforce reductions made headlines in 2022. These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloittesuggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers.\n\nKen Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented:\n\n“In 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.”\n\nSimilarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Notwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today’s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.”\n\nIn 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forresterforecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets.\n\nForrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth.\n\nCathie Wood's Latest Thoughts on Innovation Investing\n\nCathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood. Coinbase is Wood's largest portfolio holding as of Q4 2023.\n\nSome of the top tech stocks to buy include Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel’s semiconductor “fabs” in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.”\n\n9.

We continue to believe that Oracle has a unique position in Generative AI workloads and continue to like its position and strategy.”\n\n7. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 113.53%\n\nNext on our list of the best tech ETFs is Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ). The ETF aims to track the performance of the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index. It invests in companies poised to benefit from the advancement and application of artificial intelligence technology in their offerings, as well as those providing hardware for big data analysis. As of March 19, 2024, Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) holds net assets totaling $1.55 billion and maintains an expense ratio of 0.68%. Its portfolio consists of 84 stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ). On March 18, Mizuho Securities upgraded Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to a top pick with a Buy rating and a $575 price target. Analyst James Lee expects upside surprises in fiscal 2024 revenue, driven by improvements in Reels monetization, geographic expansion, Amazon partnership with Shops, and enhanced video placement optimization. Long-term investments in WhatsApp, generative AI, and the language model Llama could boost revenue per user by up to 65%, according to Lee.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 242 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n6. Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 139.09%\n\nFranklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) is an actively managed fund aiming for capital appreciation through investments in companies advancing automation and task enhancement technologies. It tracks the Russell 3000 Index and targets firms developing machine learning technologies and utilizing automated processes. Employing bottom-up fundamental research by specialized analysts, the fund identifies disruptive business models for investment. As of March 19, 2024, Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) holds net assets worth $20.08 million, featuring an expense ratio of 0.50% and a portfolio of 57 stocks.\n\nSemiconductor giant ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top holdings of Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM). On March 11, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and other semiconductor equipment firms saw a boost in 2023 due to heightened demand from China, but potential domestic substitutions may impact future gains, according to Bernstein Research. Bernstein raised ASML's price target to $1,072 from $963 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 5 million shares worth $3.76 million.\n\nIn addition to Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best tech stocks to invest in.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US 20 Biggest Energy Companies in Australia for 2024 Billionaire Steve Cohen and Insiders Are Buying These 10 Stocks\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "These investors think Trump’s new public company will flop",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has clearly scored a financial win with his media startup, Trump Media & Technology Group. Once the firm goes public, likely this week, Trump’s ownership stake could fetch more than $3 billion.\n\nBut many investors seem to think the Trump venture will flop. The Trump startup will go public via a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), a special-purpose vehicle that’s been trading since 2021. After revealing its plan to merge with Trump’s startup, DWAC’s stock soared from its opening price of $10 to a high of $98 in 2022.\n\nThe stock has since fallen back to around $50, and there’s a lot of negative sentiment not yet priced into the stock. “There is huuuuge conviction (Trump pun intended) that there will be a significant decline in the stock price in the short term,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners, said in an email.\n\nThe short interest in DWAC stock—bets that the price will fall rather than rise—is about 11% of outstanding shares, according to S3. That’s high, but not unprecedented: Average short interest in public companies is in the 3% to 4% range, though short interest can reach 40% or more if traders think a stock is doomed.\n\nBut there are very few DWAC shares available to execute short trades, which makes it extremely costly to bet against the stock. That means elevated short interest is a strong indicator of negative views of the company’s prospects. “There is very little stock available to support new short sales,” Dusaniwsky said. “But short sellers are staying in this trade even while paying over 200 times the average stock borrow rate for a US short trade.”\n\nDWAC has basically become a meme stock, a kind of viral sensation that attracts investor interest beyond what the company’s fundamentals would ordinarily suggest. That obviously stems from Trump’s notoriety and the fervent belief some supporters have in his “make America great again” crusade.\n\nMany buyers pushing up DWAC’s price have been individual investors expressing loyalty to Trump himself. But there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence that other buyers are betting on a bubble and hoping to sell before it pops.\n\nStory continues\n\n“DWAC is dropping to $2.50 after the merger,” one investor posted on Reddit’s meme-stock channel, WallStreetBets. Another suggested anybody holding the stock for the long haul is a “MAGA bagholder” who will basically end up putting money into Trump’s pocket.\n\nShort sellers betting against DWAC have lost money so far this year, since the stock has risen in anticipation of the finalization of the merger and Trump’s reemergence on public markets. But there are several reasons to think the Trump company will struggle, and shareholders will suffer, once the company is fully public.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 25: In this photo illustration, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social is shown on a tablet on March 25, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. The company is expected to go public tomorrow on the NASDAQ market, trading under the ticker symbol DJT. Trump reportedly owns about 58 percent of the company, a stake that is could be valued at roughly $3 billion. (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)\n\nFirst, the Trump company’s main business, the Truth Social networking app, is a money-losing niche player that has no obvious advantage against competitors such as X and Facebook, other than the divisive appeal of Trump himself. The company has little revenue and has lost millions since its 2022 launch.\n\nAnother risk is Trump’s own financial stake in the company, which will trade under the ticker DJT—the same symbol as a Trump casino company that went bankrupt in 2004. Trump will own at least 55% of the combined company, worth at least $3.3 billion at current valuations. But Trump could have a strong incentive to sell shares to pay legal fees associated with four criminal cases he’s battling and two civil cases where he’s been assessed more than $500 million in penalties and fees.\n\nTrump has to wait 6 months before selling any shares in the public company, according to the terms of the merger. But that would still allow him to sell shares by October. The company board could also waive that rule, which seems plausible given that it’s composed of Trump cronies plus his son, Donald Jr.\n\nIf Trump sells shares in his own company or investors even think he’s likely to sell shares, that would put downward pressure on the stock price, as normally happens when any insider sells. If Trump dumped a lot of shares to raise money quickly, shares could plummet in value.\n\nThe stock price already swings on news related to Trump's personal finances. On March 25, a New York court lowered the amount of money Trump must post while appealing a civil conviction for business fraud, from $464 million to $175 million. DWAC shares jumped nearly 20% on the news, since it suggested Trump might be less likely to sell his own company's shares to raise money. For a publicly traded stock, that's extranordinary sensitivity to one person's financial disposition and it could easily go the other way if or when Trump suffers reverses.\n\nA third risk is that Trump, likely to be the Republican presidential candidate in 2024, loses in November to incumbent President Joe Biden. A second loss to Biden would leave little political future for the 77-year-old Trump, except as a kind of Republican Party boss emeritus. Instead of being the \"in\" place for Trump supporters to converse, Truth Social would become a remnant of the Trump movement. One thing Trump’s company is, for sure, is a unique way to monetize your political beliefs about the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

But there are several reasons to think the Trump company will struggle, and shareholders will suffer. Former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social is expected to go public tomorrow on the NASDAQ market, trading under the ticker symbol DJT. (Scott Olson via Getty Images)\n\nFirst, the Trump company’s main business, the Truth Social networking app, is a money-losing niche player that has no obvious advantage against competitors such as X and Facebook other than the divisive appeal of Trump himself.\n\nAnother risk is Trump’s own financial stake in the company, which has the same ticker symbol as a Trump casino company that went bankrupt in 2004. Trump owns at least 55% of the company, and his stake jumped by more than $1 billion as the stock popped when it went public. But Trump could have a strong incentive to sell shares to pay legal fees associated with four criminal cases he’s battling and two civil cases where he’s been assessed more than $500 million in penalties and fees.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nTrump has to wait six months before selling any shares in the public company, according to the terms of the merger. But that would still allow him to sell shares by October. The company board could also waive that rule, which seems plausible given that it’s composed of Trump cronies plus his son, Donald Jr.\n\nIf Trump sells shares in his own company or investors even think he’s likely to sell shares, that would put downward pressure on the stock price, as normally happens when any insider sells. If Trump dumped a lot of shares to raise money quickly, shares could plummet in value.\n\nThe stock price already swings on news related to Trump's personal finances. On March 25, a New York court lowered the amount of money Trump must post while appealing a civil conviction for business fraud from $464 million to $175 million. Shares jumped nearly 20% on the news, since it suggested Trump might be less likely to sell his own company's shares to raise money. For a publicly traded stock, that's extraordinary sensitivity to one person's financial disposition and it could easily go the other way if or when Trump suffers reverses.\n\nA third risk is that Trump, likely to be the Republican presidential candidate in 2024, loses in November to incumbent President Joe Biden. A second loss to Biden would leave little political future for the 77-year-old Trump, except as a kind of Republican Party boss emeritus. Instead of being the \"in\" place for Trump supporters to converse, Truth Social would become a remnant of the Trump movement. One thing Trump’s company is, for sure, is a unique way to monetize your political beliefs about the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Is Selling Microsoft Stock Hand Over Fist but Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones is an iconic figure on Wall Street and has been called \"one of the pioneers of the modern-day hedge fund industry.\" He runs Tudor Investment, the hedge fund he founded in 1980.\n\nHis biggest claim to fame was predicting Black Monday, the famed stock market crash of 1987. Less than a year after his call, the market plunged more than 22%, marking the worst single-day decline since the stock market crash of 1929. Jones shorted the market, reaping a 200% gain for his hedge fund. So when Jones talks, Wall Street listens.\n\nThe billionaire investor has been quite vocal about the vast potential for artificial intelligence (AI). \"I do think the introduction of large language models [and] artificial intelligence is going to create a productivity boom that we've only seen a few times in the last 75 years,\" Jones said.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks all have AI in their DNA, so it isn't surprising that some of these market leaders would be among Tudor's top holdings. Interestingly, however, Jones just slashed his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), cutting its stake by 56%. Here are the AI-centric Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), so it isn't surprising that Tudor increased his position in the chipmaker. In the fourth quarter, Tudor Investment boosted its stake in Nvidia by a whopping 810%, increasing its stake to 132,000 shares worth roughly $121 million (as of Thursday's market close). That makes Nvidia its third-largest position, at roughly 1% of the portfolio.\n\nThe chipmaker pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for processing AI applications. Nvidia dominates the market in both machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- and the data centers where much of the AI processing occurs, boasting an estimated 95% market share in each. Nvidia's long history underpinning AI made it the shoo-in to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitors were already scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia cemented its lead last week with the release of its Blackwell architecture. Its flagship AI processor, the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, connects two B200 Tensor Core GPUs with a Grace CPU on a single board, acting as one giant processor. Big tech is already lining up to get its hands on the chips.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 265% year over year, while its earnings per share (EPS) soared 486% -- driven by accelerating demand for its AI processors. Furthermore, given the company's heavy spending on research and development (R&D) and track record of innovation, it will be difficult for rivals to gain ground.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still reasonably priced relative to its opportunity. The stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings, which is a steal given its triple-digit growth -- a fact that likely wasn't lost on Jones.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might not seem the most obvious choice in the AI space, but the company has a long history of using AI to further its business objectives.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tudor Investment more than doubled its Meta Platforms holdings, increasing its stake to roughly 102,000 shares worth roughly $52 million (as of Thursday's market close). That makes Meta Platforms a top 15 position, at roughly 0.5% of the portfolio.\n\nOne of the more intriguing developments over the past year or so has been Meta's foray into large language models. The company developed one of the leading open-source AI models -- LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud platforms, providing the company with an entirely new revenue stream.\n\nMeta recently announced it is building an AI system that it says significantly improves its video recommendations. A test on Reels resulted in \"an 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,\" according to Facebook chief Tom Alison, which shows the new AI model is \"learning from the data much more efficiently than the previous generation.\"\n\nThe company also introduced a suite of AI-fueled tools to simplify the digital ad process for advertisers on its platform and help them better reach their target market. This will ultimately bolster Meta's fortunes, since the company makes the vast majority of its revenue from digital advertising.\n\nAt just 25 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the S&P 500's valuation of 28 -- which likely factored into Tudor's decision.\n\nSmart moves?\n\nWhile I'm totally on board with Tudor boosting its stakes in Nvidia and Meta Platforms, I must admit to being completely mystified at its decision to cut its stake in Microsoft by half. The company has multiple ways to capitalize on the AI revolution.\n\nFirst, there's its growing suite of AI-fueled Copilots, which will likely be worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in incremental revenue. Second is the fact that Microsoft Azure is stealing market share from its cloud rivals thanks to its AI efforts. In my mind, those factors make Microsoft a buy, not a sell.\n\nI think Jones made a mistake in cutting its stake in Microsoft, but only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US. If you want to skip our discussion about the tech industry, visit the Top 7 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US.\n\nThe worldwide expenditure on technology is projected to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. This depicts an expected 7.75% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years starting in 2022 when the yearly spending on technology was $8,51 trillion.\n\nAlthough the tech industry faced some challenges in 2023, it forged forward and came out strong. The year was also marked by considerable anticipation regarding the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, in the year 2024, companies are looking to prioritize AI in their strategies to surpass competitors.\n\nThis is the year of AI deals and partnerships which could shape the future. It is already being reported that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Gemini-powered features on iPhones. Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google.\n\nMoving forward, spending on software and IT services backed by cloud computing and cyber security is expected to dominate the market. Tech companies will continue to experiment with different AI-related applications. In a survey by Deloitte, 52% of tech leaders stated that AI will be the primary technology in 2024. At 47%, an overwhelming proportion of tech leaders also vouched for could computing. In addition, 27% of the respondents were confident that AI will be a game changer for companies in 2024.\n\nThe United States is at the forefront of global technology and innovation. It sets the pace for advancements in various sectors. The country also has a whopping 36% share of the global information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In addition, the Consumer Technology Association anticipates that retail revenues for the US consumer technology industry will increase by 2.8% in 2024, reaching $512 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the year 2023 came with challenges for the tech sector, there were big gains for leading tech stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), fueled by the AI boom. Analysts believe that tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation. A new era of gains that started with the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 will continue to reap positive results for the tech sector way beyond 2024.\n\nAI is also helping small and mid-cap tech companies make their mark by disrupting larger companies. Theia Insights is one of the examples of small companies with the potential to disrupt entire industries with the help of AI. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of information through AI, and help investors make better decisions. Theia Insights recently also raised $6.5 million.\n\nAnother AI-related trend in the tech industry is forming partnerships, both within and outside the sector. We have already seen how Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are reported to be in negotiation to integrate generative AI in iPhones. Interestingly, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares went up by 4% following these reports.\n\nAI is also compelling tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to partner outside their industry, particularly in the form of vendor and end-user industries collaboration. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India, to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.

        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.\n\nLast year, Brussels designated six companies as \"gatekeepers\" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThey were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.\n\nBelow is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:\n\nANTI-STEERING:\n\nTwo of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around \"anti-steering\" behaviour.\n\nWhenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.\n\nTo get around this, app developers sometimes \"steer\" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.\n\nApple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.\n\nThe EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify, which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.\n\nBeyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.\n\nStory continues\n\nSELF-PREFERENCING:\n\nIn bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.\n\nThat becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.\n\nAnother of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking.com or Skyscanner.\n\nThe EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.\n\nThe EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.\n\nThe law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a \"pay or be tracked\" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.\n\nFollowing questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.\n\nOn Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.\n\nWHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?\n\nGoogle, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" Meta said.\n\n($1 = 0.9233 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

        "title": "RPT-UPDATE 3-Apple, Google, Meta targeted in EU's first Digital Markets Act probes",
        "content": "(Repeats to more subscribers)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer\n\nBRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies. The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.\n\nViolations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover. U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.\n\nTech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six \"gatekeepers\" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices. But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.\n\nAsked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.\n\n\"The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,\" he told a press conference.\n\nAPPLE COMPLIANCE\n\nAt issue is whether Apple complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.\n\nAnother concern for regulators is \"steering\": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes. Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.\n\nFEES OR NO FEES\n\nThe Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's \"free of charge\" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.\n\nBreton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.\n\n\"Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,\" the spokesperson said. Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.\n\nThe Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon's ranking practices on its marketplace.\n\nAmazon is another DMA \"gatekeeper\", along with Microsoft and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\n\"Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.\"\n\nThe EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.\n\nThe EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bart Meijer; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Catherine Evans)",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to buy for grandchildren. To skip the detailed analysis of financial markets and analysts’ outlook, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren.\n\nThe world held its breath for almost three years as the global financial markets and economy suffered from one shock after another. The bears were sure that the US economy would be hit by a recession in 2023 or 2024, but the market proved all their predictions wrong and made an impressive comeback on the back of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile the bulls are quite optimistic about the future, there are still concerns regarding a soft landing or a mild recession. A JPMorgan report points out that there are indications of slowing growth in the current year but not a total collapse and still holds the belief that a mild recession could take place in the next year. The report states:\n\n“The challenge for investors: the damage to public sector finances from mega-deficits, markets that already price in a very soft landing and the concentrated contribution of megacap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings were flat; they were up 33% for the 7 megacap stocks and down 5% across the rest of the S&P 500. All things considered, 2024 looks like a year of slowing GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth and single-digit returns on the median S&P 500 stock.”\n\nOn a global scale, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report also contains revisions regarding the IMF’s October 2023 predictions and states that the global growth is expected to be 3.1% in 2024, up 0.2% from the IMF's October predictions. The IMF predicts a 3.2% growth in 2025. Furthermore, it is believed that global headline inflation is expected to fall by 5.8% in the current year and 4.4% in 2025.\n\nIn this economic environment and volatility, millions of American families would wonder how they could help their children and grandchildren secure their financial future. One of the best ways to do that would be to teach them money management. According to the Wall Street legend, Warren Buffett, sometimes parents start teaching financial literacy to their children later than they should. He said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”\n\nBuying stocks for your children or grandchildren is also a good way to secure their financial future. Value stocks are some of the best options when looking at long-term investments. They are stocks of companies that are considered to be undervalued compared to their intrinsic value or potential for growth. Value stocks have also been endorsed by Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel for the current year. In a CNBC interview, he mentioned the abnormal gap between the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value. Based on that, he predicts a 15% gain in value stocks in 2024. Additionally, the best stocks to buy for grandchildren could include stocks with healthy long-term dividends.

The strength in the Company’s services segment was aided by over 1 billion paid subscribers across Apple’s media platforms.

Apple also continues to innovate across its hardware portfolio, with custom silicon for nearly all its device form factors.

VMEO and Logitech International S.A. LOGI.\n\n4 Top-Performing Liquid Stocks to Build a Robust Portfolio\n\nA company with strong liquidity always has the potential to provide higher returns as stable financial resources help fuel business growth. It reflects a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents.\n\nHowever, one should be careful of investing in a stock with a high liquidity level as it may also indicate that the company is failing to utilize its assets efficiently.\n\nApart from sufficient cash in hand, investors might also consider a company's capital deployment abilities before putting their money on the stock. A healthy company with favorable liquidity may prove to be a profitable pick for one's portfolio.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company's potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — the 'acid-test ratio' or 'quick assets ratio' — indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\nA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company's financial condition.\n\nHere are four stocks out of the 18 that qualified for the screen:\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world's biggest social media platform. META is gaining from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increasing engagement on its other platforms, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook, is a major growth catalyst. It is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to boost prospects.\n\nChallenging macroeconomic conditions are a concern for Meta's advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.94 per share, up 13.1% in the past 60 days. META has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.7%, on average.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corp. is a leading designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. The company sells products primarily under five proprietary brands — UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk and Other brands (mainly comprising Koolaburra). Strength in the UGG and HOKA brands is driving top-line performance.\n\nKey strategic initiatives, including product innovation and brand assortment expansion, coupled with a robust focus on direct-to-consumer channels, are propelling its growth trajectory. Successful international market penetration and a strong wholesale segment contribute to its market diversification. Proactive consumer engagement strategies and omni-channel distribution bolster its competitive edge.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal 2024 bottom line is pegged at $26.87 per share, suggesting an increase of 13.8% in the past 60 days. DECK has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.1%, on average.\n\nVimeo, Inc. provides video software solutions. The company's platform enables any professional, team and organization to unlock the power of video to create, collaborate and communicate. It has a more than 300-million strong user base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at breakeven, suggesting an improvement from a loss of 9 cents in the past 60 days. VMEO has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 252.7%, on average.\n\nLogitech International S.A. is based in Switzerland and is the parent holding company of Logitech. The company is a global leader in peripherals for personal computers and other digital platforms. It develops and markets innovative products in PC navigation, Internet communications, digital music, home-entertainment control, video security, interactive gaming and wireless devices. Increasing hybrid work trends are likely to boost demand for its video collaboration, keyboards & combos and pointing device tools.\n\nThriving cloud-based video conferencing services continue to be its key growth driver. The rising adoption of new mobile platforms in both mature and emerging markets will fuel demand for its peripherals and accessories. Its partnerships with cloud providers like Zoom Video, Microsoft and Google are major upsides. However, softening IT spending amid the current macroeconomic and geopolitical issues might hurt the company's performance in the near term.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $3.88 per share, calling for a rise of 13.1% in the past 60 days.

        "content": "apple\n\nApple, Meta and Google face the risk of fines worth billions of euros as the European Union launched its first major investigations into compliance of new Big Tech laws.\n\nMargrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton, the EU’s competition and digital markets chiefs, announced five investigations into the three companies on Monday.\n\nThey concern areas including the companies’ smartphone app stores and Meta charging a monthly fee to users in Europe who do not want to see adverts on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt comes less than three weeks after the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force. The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers – Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn). It comes just weeks after it was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.\n\nThe investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.\n\nThe European Commission said Meta’s fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.\n\nMr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, in the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets that took effect earlier this month.\n\nThe European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services” by forcing them to comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable\" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.\n\nThe commission said in a press release that it “suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.”\n\nIt's looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to offers available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.\n\nGoogle is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”\n\nThe commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers. It's also looking into Meta's option for users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.\n\n“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Have Tripled the Market's Return So Far This Year",
        "content": "The rally that sent stocks soaring 24% in 2023 isn't over just yet. Year to date, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained another 9.9% as Mar. 21. Wall Street has been enthusiastic about the prospect that interest rates could start declining soon, while the U.S. economy remains in growth mode.\n\nMany stocks have benefited disproportionately from that bullish attitude among investors, but a few stand out for already tripling the market's year-to-date return. Let's look at three of the biggest winners so far this year: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Deckers(NYSE: DECK), and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX).\n\n1. Deckers\n\nDeckers has been riding a wave of strong demand for many of its popular footwear brands like Hoka and Ugg. These wins help it stand out compared to peers such as Nike, which has been struggling with weak sales and pricing trends recently.\n\nDeckers is seeing no such challenges. In fact, sales were up 16% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31). Compare that to Nike's modest sales decline in its last reported quarter, and you can understand why investors have pushed Deckers stock higher this year. The company is also selling many of its products at full price, highlighting another way this business has separated itself from competitors. Gross profit margin jumped to 53% of sales last quarter compared to 48% of sales in the prior-year period.\n\nManagement hiked its fiscal 2024 outlook for a second time last month. Inventory levels are low as well, suggesting lots of room for earnings growth and higher stock returns ahead.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nA year ago, investors were worried about Meta Platforms' slowing growth and its ballooning expenses, yet those concerns have completely fallen away over the last few quarters. The social media giant is not only boosting its user base but improving the economics around its ads.\n\nLarge advertisers are sticking with the Facebook and Instagram platforms even as they pull back on spending elsewhere. Ad impressions rose 21% in the fourth quarter, contributing to a 25% increase in revenue. Combine that success with dramatic cost-cutting moves (its employee headcount was down 22% last quarter), and you've got the ingredients you need for soaring earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income jumped 69% in 2023 to $39.1 billion. As if that wasn't enough to keep Wall Street happy, Meta also initiated a dividend with the first payout hitting shareholders' accounts in late March.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nDon't look now, but Netflix stock is finally climbing back toward the all-time high it set in late 2021. The streaming video giant has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride the past few years. Shares collapsed from approximately $690 to $170 as the pandemic growth hangover set in, and the company endured its first-ever back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses (in Q1 and Q2 2022).\n\nIt turns out that decline was just a temporary speed bump -- year-over-year subscriber gains have accelerated for four consecutive quarters with 12.8% growth in Q4. Netflix now counts 260.3 million paying subscribers, up from 230.8 million at the start of 2023.\n\nWall Street is excited about the prospects for even faster growth ahead as Netflix's advertising business matures and its account-sharing crackdown continues to reap benefits. As long as Netflix can keep boosting its subscriber base, cash flow, and operating margins, investors can expect to keep watching this stock deliver excellent returns.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Netflix made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 21, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Meta Platforms Stock?",
        "content": "Many tech stocks surged over the past year thanks to factors such as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. One stock that more than doubled in that time is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nThe Facebook parent was at a 52-week low of $197.90 last March, but made an incredible reversal, and this March, it reached a high of $523.57. Shares have retreated from that, so is now the time to buy? Or is it too late to reap further upside?\n\nTo assess the situation, it's best to evaluate Meta from the perspective of a long-term investment. With this in mind, let's look at the social media company to determine if it makes sense to invest in its stock at this time.\n\nHow Meta shares achieved outsize results\n\nPart of evaluating Meta as a potential investment requires understanding how its shares performed such a remarkable about-face over the last year. The factors leading to this outcome began in 2022.\n\nAt the start of that year, the company's share price exceeded $300. But as the year wore on, shares were battered because advertisers reduced spending with the company in 2022 and into 2023 in response to conditions at the time, such as rising inflation.\n\nThis was a blow to Meta since digital advertising accounts for nearly all of its revenue. As a result, 2022 sales dropped to $116.6 billion from $117.9 billion in 2021.\n\nThat set the stage for the comeback. The advertising market recovered in 2023, allowing Meta to achieve full-year revenue of $134.9 billion, a 16% year-over-year gain.\n\nThe company also aggressively cut costs last year with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency.\" As part of this, the company reduced its employee count by 22% compared to 2022.\n\nThis helped to bring 2023 costs and expenses to $88.2 billion. Although this figure was a modest increase from $87.7 billion in 2022, it was a vast improvement over the 23% jump between 2021's $71.2 billion in expenses and 2022.\n\nThese cost cuts helped Meta generate strong free cash flow (FCF) of $43 billion last year, a substantial increase from $18.4 billion in 2022. FCF provides insight into the cash available to invest in the business, pay debt obligations, repurchase shares, and fund dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsequently, Meta declared its first dividend in company history on Feb. 1. This news, its cost cuts, and strong revenue rebound all contributed to the share price shooting skyward.\n\nMeta's future revenue growth\n\nYear-over-year revenue gains are likely to continue, at least in 2024. The advertising industry forecasts digital ad spending to increase this year by more than 13% over 2023, serving as a tailwind for Meta's revenue growth.\n\nThe company expects first-quarter revenue of at least $34.5 billion, which would be a double-digit increase over 2023's $28.6 billion. Beyond advertising, Meta looks toward the twin tech innovations of the metaverse and AI for its business growth.\n\nLast year, Meta released the latest version of its smart glasses, now infused with AI, that allow the wearer to livestream to Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg described this product as \"a good example of how our AI and metaverse visions are connected.\"\n\nThis kind of innovation could help keep users attached to the company's services. In fact, the number of monthly active users for its products, excluding its Reality Labs division, ticked up from 3.7 billion to 4 billion in 2023.\n\nAnd the Reality Labs segment, which develops products for the metaverse, generated quarterly revenue of over $1 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo buy or not to buy Meta stock\n\nMeta's success is far from assured in these new technologies. For instance, management says its investments in the metaverse \"may only be fully realized in the next decade.\"\n\nAnother consideration is that Wall Street analysts estimate a median price target of $525 for its stock. This indicates a belief in some upside for Meta shares, although analysts don't expect the outsize growth experienced over the past year.\n\nThis assessment by analysts combined with rising advertising income and Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse -- which can extend its reach beyond computer and mobile phone screens -- mean Meta stock is a buy.\n\nThat said, the stock has an uphill climb to outperform in the way it did over the past year. The company experienced a specific confluence of factors that propelled its stock to gains eight times greater than the S&P 500 in 2023.\n\nBut long-term prospects look promising, especially if efforts, such as its Meta glasses, can develop into significant revenue streams to help the company diversify beyond advertising.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a force to reckon with in the modern economy and is transforming the lives of people across the world. Not surprisingly, AI has also become a major investment trend and has piqued the interest of seasoned and new investors.\n\nWhile several companies now boast cutting-edge AI-powered technologies and solutions, it is also essential for investors to consider other aspects such as market share, competitive advantages, and scalability of the business. Companies such as Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) seem to fit the bill.\n\nIf all goes well, these companies can deliver exceptional returns and help build lasting generational wealth for patient investors. Here's why.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir Technologies, a leading data mining software and machine learning specialist, has seen a remarkable surge in its stock price in the last month. Shares are up by nearly 40% since the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 5.\n\nOnce known mainly for helping government agencies in thwarting terrorist plots, Palantir's commercial segment is now rising to prominence. While government business presently contributes 53% of Palantir's total revenue, the revenue mix is increasingly shifting toward the commercial segment. This transition is expected to boost Palantir's margins, since private clients allow for higher pricing flexibility and involve lower regulatory hurdles compared to government clients. Palantir's focus on developing industry-specific solutions and targeting key verticals such as government, healthcare, pharmaceutical, banking, and automotive has also enabled it to differentiate itself from the competition and build strong relationships with clients. This has ensured a sticky customer base for the company.\n\nPalantir is also seeing solid growth in its overall customer base, thanks to the rapid adoption of the recently launched generative artificial intelligence-powered software suite called AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). The company has opted for an effective go-to-market strategy, centered around its Bootcamp approach, to enable existing and prospective customers to quickly grasp AIP's capabilities. This, in turn, has accelerated the sales cycle and helped successfully convert engagements into lucrative partnerships.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the favorable tilt in revenue mix, entrenched customer relationships, and success of the AIP platform, Palantir can prove to be a smart long-term investment.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the owner of wildly famous social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has undergone a remarkable turnaround, with its stock witnessing a staggering surge of nearly 450% from its low in November 2022. The company's focus on leveraging AI technologies to improve user engagement and ad targeting, and its effort to control costs have been instrumental in this resurgence.\n\nAccording to Magna, digital ad spending is expected to grow by 7.2% year over year to $913 billion in 2024, driven mainly by improving economic conditions, lowering inflation, and major events such as the U.S. elections and European football. Meta stands to benefit especially from the increasing demand for digital pure-play (DPP) ad formats such as search and e-commerce advertising, social media advertising, and short-form video advertising in 2024.\n\nBesides secular tailwinds in the digital advertising space, Meta also benefits from its exceptional customer reach. With 3.2 billion people using at least one of the social media platforms (family of apps) daily (which amounts to nearly 40% of the global population), Meta enjoys a formidable position in the digital advertising market. The company's short-form video format Reels is helping drive engagement across both Instagram and Facebook. Since reels are now reshared 3.5 billion times every day, Reels ads can also emerge as a major revenue contributor in the coming years.\n\nMeta's AI-driven recommendations system is helping improve user engagement by suggesting more personalized content. Furthermore, the company is also helping advertisers craft targeted campaigns and measure advertising performance with its portfolio of AI- and ML-powered tools such as Advantage+, A/B Testing, and Conversions API. These AI initiatives drove up both ad impressions and average price per ad in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), translating into solid financial performance for the company.\n\nIt is undeniable that Meta's Reality Labs division remains loss-making even in 2023. Yet, its losses have been more than offset by the company's social media advertising business. Meta Platforms is currently trading at 24.8 times forward 2024 earnings. Although higher than its historical valuation, it is still lower than the valuation multiples of the remaining \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks except for Alphabet. Yet, excluding Nvidia, Meta's stock has performed better than all other Magnificent Seven stocks in the past year.\n\nHence, based on its solid fundamentals and reasonable growth-adjusted valuation, Meta Platforms seems to be an attractive big tech pick in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "If artificial intelligence (AI) is as important to mankind as some believe, investors won't need much money to generate significant long-term wealth -- as long as they pick the right stocks.\n\nThese three Motley Fool contributors set out to highlight three winning artificial intelligence stocks that investors can buy for under $1,000 and confidently hold for the long term -- hopefully forever.\n\nAfter an exhaustive search, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) emerged as leading contenders.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nMicrosoft's OpenAI partnership is paying big dividends\n\nJustin Pope (Microsoft): I don't know that Microsoft knew how successful its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI would become when they initially got together in 2019. But no one can argue that it hasn't become a significant advantage over its competitors today. Microsoft has woven OpenAI's technology right into its various software products. Additionally, the partnership funnels all OpenAI compute needs through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.\n\nOpenAI has expanded beyond its large language model ChatGPT to recently launched video creation engine Sora and humanoid robotics via a joint venture between OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft with start-up robotics company Figure.\n\nIt's not like Microsoft needs the upside that tying up with OpenAI provides. We're talking about a $3 trillion company with deeper pockets than almost any business on Earth and a better credit rating than the U.S. government. It's also one that generates roughly $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies accumulate in revenue.\n\nPerhaps it's only natural that such a technology juggernaut would happen to partner with the company that turned into arguably the leader in AI innovation today. You have plenty of reasons outside OpenAI to buy and hold Microsoft forever. However, the long-term potential upside of AI and all the ways OpenAI brings Microsoft to that dance are undoubtedly good reasons to believe Microsoft's future is bright.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe overlooked AI communications stock that can connect investors to profits\n\nWill Healy(Qualcomm): Qualcomm may have become the forgotten AI chip stock. Most of the focus has fallen to Nvidia, and understandably so, due to its dominant market share.\n\nNonetheless, devices of all kinds will serve as platforms for generative AI, and Qualcomm-supported phones are no exception. The company has just released its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which supports AI models that support as many as 10 billion parameters from one's smartphones. The chip's capabilities also allow it to create pictures enhanced by AI, engage in \"console-defying\" mobile gaming, or listen to studio-quality audio, all from one's device.\n\nBut Qualcomm doesn't rely exclusively on smartphones. The company has extended its capabilities into the Internet of Things and automotive chips and has begun to develop processors for laptops and tablets. Those products should ultimately expand Qualcomm's AI capabilities.\n\nThe company is coming out of a slump in the chip industry and an uncertain economy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 24, 2023), revenue of $9.9 billion rose by 5% year over year. This came after a 19% decline in fiscal 2023. Fortunately, it remains profitable as fiscal Q1 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income rose 24% yearly to $2.7 billion.\n\nLooking at the stock performance, it's hard to say whether investors are reacting to its AI potential or lackluster finances in recent quarters. The stock is up 35% over the last year. While impressive, it dramatically underperformed other AI chip stocks such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. QCOM Chart\n\nNonetheless, with a P/E ratio of 24 and a forward P/E ratio of 17, one can argue that Qualcomm is attractively priced, particularly when considering AMD's forward earnings multiple of 50 or Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 37.\n\nThat valuation could give investors a chance to buy into an AI chip stock at an attractive price. Also, at $165 per share, investors with a $1,000 budget have the opportunity to purchase a few shares before more investors notice Qualcomm's AI capabilities.\n\nMeta combines the best features of a start-up and a cash cow\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Up 41% year to date, Meta Platforms is nevertheless an under-the-radar AI stock. This dichotomy is related to Meta's biggest strength -- it paradoxically combines the traits of a cash cow and a tech start-up.\n\nFirst, consider Meta's cash-cow advertising business. The company generated nearly $135 billion in revenue last year, nearly all of it coming from advertising across its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms. Thanks to Meta's asset-light business model, 35% of that revenue, or $47 billion, was converted into operating profit. That's a fantastic rate, and it helps explain why the company introduced a regular dividend payment for shareholders.\n\nYet, Meta is more than just a profitable tech giant. The company is investing billions of dollars in AI research. In fact, Meta is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia's flagship AI chip, the H100. None other than founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would be running upwards of 350,000 H100s this year to train its AI models.\n\nWhat does Meta need with all that computing power? Well, it has several ambitious goals, such as perfecting its version of the metaverse and developing Artificial General Intelligence.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, gives Meta investors lots to be excited about, such as the potential for explosive growth -- if the company ever achieves its ambitious AI goals -- combined with a river of cash flow thanks to its legacy social media business.\n\nIn short, Meta is the type of AI stock investors can buy now and hold for years to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 21, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "This Is the Next \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Pay a Dividend (and It Could Be the Biggest of the Bunch)",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't exactly know for their dividends but rather for their growth. But if a company's payout can grow by double digits for a large number of years, investing in leading tech growth stocks today could yield some impressive retirement income decades down the road.\n\nWhat could be even more lucrative? If you own a high-growth stock that begins to start paying a dividend after you've owned it for a number of years. When this fortunate event happens, one has probably already seen a large appreciation in the stock, so even a small nominal yield can amount to a substantial payout relative to one's initial investment.\n\nOf the three remaining Mag Seven stocks that don't pay a dividend, I'd say it's a pretty solid bet which one will be next. Not only that, but its potential payout could offer the highest yield of the group when it begins.\n\nAlphabet is a cash cow that should really pay a dividend\n\nWith exception of perhaps Apple and Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet is the Magnificent Seven stock with the greatest capacity to pay a dividend -- and yet it doesn't.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet generated a massive $74 billion in net income, which is the third highest profit figure of the Mag Seven. And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft's $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.\n\nCompany Net Income (TTM) Dividend Yield  Payout Ratio Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $100.9 billion 0.55% 14.8% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $82.5 billion 0.71% 25.2% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) $73.8 billion 0% 0% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $39.1 billion 0.40% 13.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $29.8 billion 0.16% 1.3%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion.\n\nTo its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.\n\nBut all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out.\n\nSome may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds.\n\nReasons to not pay a dividend\n\nOf course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.\n\nI think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nYet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time.\n\nStill, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments.\n\nAlphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various \"moonshot\" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.\n\nA dividend is probably coming at some point\n\nOnce Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.\n\nWhile it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Is Up 40% This Year. Here's Why It's Still a Fantastic Buy",
        "content": "The average return of the S&P 500 over the long term is about 10% per year. So, many times, when a stock returns 40% or more within a year, investors will immediately throw up their red flags. Some will sell, and others refuse to buy, but looking solely at the stock's return is a terrible way to judge whether it's a buy.\n\nIf you do that, you'll miss out on many of the market's biggest winners: Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have had an amazing run since the start of 2023; yet, if you sold when you were up 40%, you missed out on massive, portfolio-changing returns.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is in this boat as well. The stock is up 40% in 2024 and over 300% since the start of 2023. But despite that success, I think it still has room for more.\n\nMeta's advertising business is keeping the lights on\n\nMeta Platforms is likely better known by its old name: Facebook. Its primary business is advertising, which is done through its Family of Apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads. In 2022, the stock was beaten down because it was burning cash by heavily investing in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on next-generation technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality, and the metaverse.\n\nBack then, these were mostly luxury gaming technologies that didn't really serve a purpose. But with artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision is becoming a bit clearer.\n\nMeta is working on a game-changing AI called Ego, which will eventually integrate into AR glasses. This could be used for tasks like teaching people how to cook or communicating with those who don't speak the same language as us.\n\nIf this endeavor succeeds, Meta's stock could become an absolute rocket ship and easily add billions in sales.\n\nHowever, as this moonshot division develops products, the advertising business is holding steady. In the fourth quarter, Meta posted record ad sales, with $38.7 billion in revenue (up 24% year over year). With Meta converting 54% of that revenue into operating profits, it is an incredible cash-generation machine. The Reality Labs division burned $4.6 billion of those profits in pursuit of its goals, but that still leaves an incredible $16.4 billion (a 41% operating margin) left over for investors.\n\nStory continues META Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThese profits are added to Meta's ever-growing cash stockpile, which sits at around $65.4 billion as of the end of Q4. With only $18.4 billion in long-term debt on the balance sheet, it has plenty of cash on the sidelines to do whatever it wants.\n\nSo, Meta decided to pay a dividend. If you held shares on Feb. 22, you're entitled to a $0.50 per share dividend that will be paid on March 26. That works out to a 0.4% dividend yield, which isn't a lot. But all great dividend companies have to start somewhere, and some dividends are better than none.\n\nAll these facts look at Meta's previous results, which are fantastic. But why is the stock a buy right now?\n\nThe stock trades at a fair price\n\nIf we look at Meta's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, it trades around 25 times forward earnings. While that's not terribly cheap, it isn't a bad price for a company on the cutting edge of AI technologies and growing revenue at a 25% pace.\n\nAdditionally, when compared to other big-tech stocks, like Apple and Microsoft, that aren't growing fast and trade at a higher premium, Meta's stock looks fairly priced.\n\nMeta is a huge player in AI and is succeeding with its social media products. Meta's growth is just getting started, and investors would be unwise to sell now. In fact, I think they can confidently buy the stock now with the expectation of it being much higher three to five years down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "4 Magnificent Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Who needs theme parks packed with roller coasters when you can simply put your money to work on Wall Street? Over the previous four years, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets, with the wildest swings observed in the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nWhen 2022 came to a close, the innovation-fueled Nasdaq had lost 33% of its value and badly trailed the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average in the return column. But since the proverbial curtain opened on 2023, the Nasdaq Composite has been off to the races, with the widely followed index gaining nearly 57% and pushing to all-time highs. There's absolutely no question that a new bull market has emerged on Wall Street. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut just because the Nasdaq Composite can't be stopped, it doesn't mean opportunistic long-term investors can't still find amazing deals among growth stocks.\n\nWhat follows are four magnificent growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first astounding growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not scooping up with the Nasdaq Composite still in a relatively young bull market is none other than social media powerhouse Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nTo be fair, there are a couple of money-based figures and predictive indicators that suggest a recession could be in the cards this year. Meta generated nearly 98% of its revenue last year from advertising. Ad-based businesses typically struggle during economic contractions, which is the biggest worry for Meta and its current shareholders in 2024.\n\nHowever, recessions are a short-term concern. Out of the one dozen U.S. recessions that have occurred since the end of World War II in September 1945, only three reached the 12-month mark and none surpassed 18 months. Businesses that bring in most of their revenue from ads, like Meta, thrive from long-winded periods of growth.\n\nWhat makes Meta Platforms so special is its top-notch social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site in the world. When added to Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, Meta is luring close to 4 billion active users to its family of apps each month. There isn't a social media platform that offers access to more eyeballs than Meta. If the U.S. economy is expanding, this is a company that's going to command strong ad-pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also a company that knows how to rake in cash. In 2023, Meta Platforms generated north of $71 billion in cash from its operations and closed out the year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This cash buffer affords the company the ability to take risks, such as the development of augmented/virtual reality devices and furthering its metaverse ambitions.\n\nMaybe the hardest thing to believe about Meta is that it's still incredibly cheap. Earnings per share (EPS) is expected to more than double between 2023 and 2027. Further, it's trading at a 9% discount to its average cash-flow multiple over the past five years, based on Wall Street's consensus cash-flow estimates for 2025.\n\nExelixis\n\nA second magnificent growth stock you'll regret not buying hand over fist during the early stages of the Nasdaq bull market is cancer-drug developer Exelixis(NASDAQ: EXEL).\n\nOne of the best things about healthcare stocks is that they're highly defensive. Since people can't control when they get sick or what ailment(s) they develop, demand for things like prescription drugs and healthcare services remains consistent in any economic climate. For a biotech stock like Exelixis, it means highly predictable cash flow year after year.\n\nLead drug Cabometyx is what makes Exelixis tick. It's been approved to treat first- and second-line renal cell carcinoma, as well as advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. These indications alone have helped push Cabometyx's annual sales to north of $1 billion.\n\nHowever, Exelixis is examining its top cancer drug in more than five dozen clinical trials as a monotherapy or combination treatment. Late-stage studies for patients with advanced pancreatic and extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with Roche's Tecentriq) recently met their primary endpoints and may pave the way for additional label expansion opportunities.\n\nDon't overlook Exelixis' amazing balance sheet, either. Though it doesn't have Meta's massive treasure chest, it did close out 2023 with a healthy $1.72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. This is more than enough capital to fuel the company's internal research engine and promote collaborations.\n\nBased on Wall Street's consensus expectations, Exelixis is expected to nearly quadruple its EPS, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to $2.50 per share over the next four years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nThe third jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite powering its way to new highs is cybersecurity company SentinelOne(NYSE: S). Although investors were less than enthused about SentinelOne's first-quarter revenue guidance, there are a number of reasons for opportunistic investors to be excited about the recent swoon in its share price.\n\nSimilar to Exelixis, SentinelOne enjoys cash-flow stability. With businesses shifting their data online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace, endpoint cybersecurity providers like SentinelOne are being relied on more than ever. Since hackers don't take time off, demand for cybersecurity solutions remains steady in any economic environment.\n\nOne of the reasons SentinelOne has become a trusted partner for protecting sensitive information is its Singularity platform. Singularity is artificial intelligence (AI)-driven and utilizes machine learning so that it can evolve over time and become more effective at hunting down potential threats before they become a problem.\n\nBut what investors are bound to love is the company's key performance indicators, which are predominantly moving in the right direction. Fourth-quarter sales increased 38%, with annualized recurring revenue (ARR) rising by 39%. SentinelOne is predominantly subscription-driven, which reinforces the predictability of its operating cash flow, and is steadily lifting its adjusted gross margin (currently 78%, as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Jan. 31, 2024).\n\nAnother key for SentinelOne is that it's winning over larger customers. It ended fiscal 2024 with 1,133 customers generating ARR of at least $100,000, which is 30% more than the year-ago period. These bigger fish should help the company turn the corner to recurring profits in fiscal 2025.\n\nWith revenue on pace to potentially triple over the next four years, now looks like the perfect time to add this fast-paced cybersecurity stock to your portfolio.\n\nPinterest\n\nThe fourth magnificent growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is social media up-and-comer Pinterest(NYSE: PINS).\n\nIf there's been a prevailing concern with Pinterest over the past couple of years, it's been the company's monthly active user (MAU) growth. Though there's more to valuing a social media company than MAUs, investors were clearly not pleased with Pinterest's MAUs shrinking in 2022 following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with the company's MAUs growing by 11% during the December-ended quarter to a record 498 million, reasons to be skeptical of Pinterest are dwindling.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Pinterest has time on its side. Since most periods of economic growth last years, if not a full decade, advertising-based businesses tend to be a smart place for investors to put their money to work. With nearly a half-billion MAUs, Pinterest's ad-pricing power should climb.\n\nAs I've pointed out in the past, Pinterest is uniquely positioned to succeed regardless of what app developers do with regard to data-tracking tools. Whereas most social media sites are relying on data-tracking tools to help advertisers target users, the entire premise of Pinterest's platform is for users to freely and willingly share what things, places, and services they like. This makes it incredibly easy for Pinterest to serve targeted data to advertisers.\n\nPinterest's robust cash position is another catalyst for the company. It closed out 2023 with roughly $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities -- and this was after repurchasing $500 million worth of its common stock. Having a healthy cash position allows Pinterest to innovate, as well as return capital to its long-term investors.\n\nLastly, Pinterest's valuation is enticing. On top of sustained double-digit sales growth, Wall Street is looking for the company's annual EPS to double over the next four years. With a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) below 1, Pinterest is a screaming bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Meta Platforms (META)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 17.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 34.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 24.2%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.7% this year versus the industry average of 9.2%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nFor growth investors, a company's financial strength, overall health, and future outlook take precedence, so they'll want to zero in on the Growth Style Score. This Score examines things like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will generate sustainable growth over time.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, eBay Inc. EBAY and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Solid Stocks to Buy as S&P 500 Hits New Record High\n\nWall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. AI-centered stocks rallied last year and the momentum continues into this year, with a large number of companies trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., eBay Inc. and American Water Works Company, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year.

NVDA, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV, Synopsys Inc. SNPS and Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nFed Reaffirms 3 Rate Cuts This Year: 5 Technology Picks\n\nOn Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023. Its current level marks the highest in 23 years. Since the beginning of 2024, market participants have been busy predicting when the central bank will cut interest rates for the first time.\n\nRecently, a large section of financial researchers and economists were worried about the rate cut as the inflation rate remains sticky supported by a resilient labor market, increasing wage rate and strong consumer spending. However, in a relief to investors, the Fed reiterated the number of interest rate cuts that it had indicated in the December FOMC meeting.\n\nFed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate to come down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nIn his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this type of cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.”\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing the March FOMC decision, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 75% probability that the first rate cut will come in the June FOMC meeting. This probability was 60% just before Powell’s post-FOMC statement.\n\nConsequently, Wall Street rallied to record highs. The broad-market index — the S&P 500 — closed at 5,224.62 after hitting an all-time high of 5,226.19. The benchmark closed above 5,200 for the first time. The blue-chip Dow recorded an all-time high of 39,529.13 and a closing high of 39,512.13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a new closing high of 16,369.41.\n\nGrowth Sectors to Benefit\n\nDespite its higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. Investment in growth stocks creates wealth over a long period of time.\n\nA lower market interest rate will decrease the discount rate, which in turn will raise the net present value of investment. Moreover, many of these companies depend on the chip source of credit for the business to grow.\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $35 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 71% and 82.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the past seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the past 30 days. The stock price of META has jumped 42.8% year to date.\n\nVeeva Systems Inc.’s continued focus on research and development and a strong product portfolio buoy optimism. VEEV has also been witnessing robust customer adoption of its products, which is encouraging.\n\nVEEV has inked a few strategic alliances over the past few months. A strong liquidity position is an added plus. We expect total revenues and adjusted earnings per share are likely to witness a CAGR of 12.8% and 11.7% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026, respectively.\n\nVeeva Systems has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.8% and 25.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.9% over the past 30 days. The stock price of VEEV has climbed 19.6% year to date.\n\nSynopsys Inc. is benefiting from solid design wins due to a robust product portfolio. Growth in the hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for SNPS’ Fusion Compiler product is boosting its top line. The growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects for SNPS. Moreover, the rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things and big data is driving investments in new computing and machine learning architectures.\n\nSynopsys has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.2% and 21.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the past 30 days. The stock price of SNPS has advanced 14.6% year to date.\n\nCadence Design Systems Inc. is gaining from robust customer demand. CDNS ended 2023 with a backlog of $6 billion and current remaining performance obligations of $3.2 billion. CDNS’ accelerated design activity owing to transformative generational trends such as generative AI, hyperscale computing, 5G and autonomous driving is likely to boost the top line.\n\nMomentum in 3D-IC and chipset designs bodes well for CDNS. Expansion of its well-established partnerships with strategic partners like NVIDIA, Arm and Intel is a tailwind. Revenues for 2024 are now projected in the range of $4.55-$4.61 billion.\n\nCadence Design Systems has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.2% and 15.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the past 30 days. The stock price of CDNS has appreciated 16.4% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 20 Countries with the Most Social Media Users. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the use of social media over the years, you can go directly to the top 5 Countries with the Most Social Media Users.\n\nOver two and a half decades ago, in 1997, during the hot and drizzly month of May, the world changed forever. And hardly anyone realized it at all. It all began when a man based in New York City – Andrew Weinreich – conceived the idea of a connected world, where anyone could connect with anyone. In May 1997, he put that idea to test and introduced the world: the world’s first-ever social media site, SixDegrees.com.\n\nPerhaps, the site was a bit too ahead of its time, and the world was just not prepared to embrace an idea that held such enormity. Soon after, in 1999, the platform was acquired by YouthStream Media Networks, and in 2001, the platform shut down for good.\n\nWe say that the world wasn’t prepared for a true social media platform, because during the same month in which SixDegrees was launched, America Online had also launched its AOL instant messaging platform. While Andrew was only able to expand his to around 3,500,000 fully registered members throughout his platform’s life, AOL’s Instant Messenger attracted more than 61 million registered users by 2001.\n\nIn between these formative years, the world was also introduced to the first ever social blogging network: Open Diary, a game-based social networking site: Habbo, and two new messenger platforms: Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger. In the years that followed, by 2003, more and more social networking platforms were launched including Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Skype.\n\nIn 2004, the world changed forever again. The only difference was that by this time, the world had been prepared for change, and the realization of change was also there, although not as profound as it can be today. During this year, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s Facebook was launched. By this time, over 899 million people were using the Internet worldwide. Compared to 1997, this was an increase of 782 million people.\n\nStory continues\n\nSix years later, in 2011, the number of social media platforms and the number of Internet users had only gone up — Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), Instagram, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), Google+, Tumblr, Twitter, and Quora had made their debuts and the internet now had over 2,135 million users.\n\nFast forward to today, in 2024, there are now over 5.4 billion Internet users (See: 25 Countries With The Highest Number of Internet Users in 2024) and 5.04 billion social media users worldwide. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has not only acquired WhatsApp and Instagram but has rebranded itself and has continued to maintain Facebook as the most used social media platform in the world, with nearly 3.05 billion users today. Interestingly, all three of these apps are also the world’s top 3 favorite apps, according to data published by GWI.\n\nPinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), on the other hand, is not as famous amongst social media users as its peers despite its growing fame in recent years. However, it’s still the 15th most active social media platform with 463 million monthly active users around the world; 90.1 million out of these are users from the United States of America. It is also interesting to note that compared to Facebook, Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS)’s advertising reach grew much more rapidly in 2023. While Facebook’s global advertising reach increased by only 5.0% (+108 million new users), Pinterest’s reach grew by 20.2%.\n\nIf we bring in another competitor in the frame, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP)’s advertising audience reach grew by 11.0% in the same year. Note that Snapchat is the 10th most active social media platform as of 2024, with the majority of its user base being in India, the USA, and Pakistan. Although Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) is growing rapidly, it still has a long way to go if it wants to increase its user base as high as Facebook.\n\nFurthermore, if we look at the use of social media platforms by country, and social media in general, South Africa, Brazil, Philippines, Colombia, and Argentina are the top 5 countries by average hours spent on social media. While only about 239.0 million Americans use social media, India has the largest user base for some of the most used social platforms — it has the most Facebook users, most Instagram users, and most YouTube users. Note that despite having high numbers of social media users, neither the US nor India nor any of the top 5 countries who spend the most hours on social media make it to the list of countries with the most social media users.\n\nMeanwhile, the country that uses the least social media is Nigeria, with only 36.75 social media users as of 2024. Furthermore, according to a recent research published by GWI, a “typical” social media user now spends an average of 2 hours and 23 minutes daily on social media. If we look at the cumulative figure for all 195 countries in the world, this means that in 2024 alone, we will be using 500 million years' worth of social media!\n\nBelow, we list the 20 Countries with the Most Social Media Users. 20 Countries with the Most Social Media Users\n\n20 Countries with the Most Social Media Users\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of most social media users by country, we’ve obtained data from DataReportal’s Digital 2024 Global Overview report. Note that this data is inclusive of duplicate and “non-human” social media accounts like businesses, pets, brands, etc. Therefore, the figures do not equate to or represent the unique and individual human users.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 industries which produce the most billionaires. We have also talked about the latest news surrounding billionaires and their wealth. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries that Produce the Most Billionaires.\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 billionaires experienced a phenomenal increase in wealth, collectively amassing an additional $465.6 billion—an impressive 46% increase compared to the S&P 500's 24% annual gain. Leading this financial ascent was Elon Musk, whose net worth catapulted from $137 billion to $229 billion within the year, followed closely by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s Mark Zuckerberg, who increased from $45.6 billion to $128 billion.\n\nEven philanthropic endeavors couldn't halt the upward trajectory of billionaire wealth. Warren Buffett, despite donating $5 billion in June and $870 million in November of the previous year, witnessed $13 billion increase in his net worth since January 2, 2023.\n\nNonetheless, despite the increase in billionaire wealth, President Biden proposed major tax reforms in his State of the Union address on March 8, 2024 with an aim to increase taxes on billionaires and corporations. Biden suggested raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and implementing a minimum tax for billionaires at 25%. He highlighted the disparity in tax rates, noting that some of America's wealthiest individuals pay lower federal taxes than average citizens. Additionally, Biden emphasized the need to end tax breaks for industries such as Big Pharma and Big Oil, while also advocating for a reduction in CEO salaries.\n\nThese proposals represent Biden's attempt to distinguish his progressive agenda from his Republican rival, Donald Trump, ahead of the upcoming elections. However, the feasibility of these reforms remains uncertain, as they require congressional approval.\n\nWhile billionaires are the highlight of our discussion, let’s talk about achieving the millionaire status now. In a survey by Ameriprise Financial, 80% of Americans with $1 million or more in investable assets attributed their financial success to financial planning and investing. Additionally, 70% acknowledged making a good income and living within their means as key factors. Only 13% credited luck for their wealth. Between 2019 and 2022, approximately 6 million American households saw their net worth exceed $1 million. Ameriprise's study, focusing on 580 Americans, aimed to understand how individuals reached the $1 million savings milestone. The study revealed that 85% of respondents associated wealth with financial security, 66% linked it to providing for family, and 58% to personal freedom.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, another study found that middle-aged and millennial workers estimated needing $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for comfortable retirement, yet less than a third of each group expected to achieve these goals. While 60% of millionaires considered themselves upper middle class, only 8% classified themselves as wealthy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the light of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s trajectory, its capitalization and diverse business portfolio, the prospect of achieving millionaire status through investment in the tech giant has become more tangible. The company's stock growth over recent decades has been remarkable, with its market capitalization nearing $3 trillion, surpassing even Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite a seemingly lofty valuation, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s diverse business model spanning cloud services, gaming, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence positions it as a leader across various tech sectors. Its solid financial foundation, with over $140 billion in cash reserves and significant operating cash flow, ensures resilience and agility in navigating market fluctuations and seizing growth opportunities through innovation or acquisitions. While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock may command a premium, its potential to sustain market-beating returns remains promising, supported by its ongoing technological advancements and established market presence.\n\nInvestors looking to secure a place in the millionaire club should weigh Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock alongside other options. While its valuation might appear steep compared to peers like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s strong growth prospects and financial strength offer a compelling case for long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, the Walton family stands atop America's richest families list with a monumental net worth of $267 billion as of 2024, primarily fueled by their major stake in Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer. Holding an estimated 45% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s stock, the family's wealth is distributed among seven heirs of Sam and Bud Walton, the founders. Rob Walton's tenure as chairman and strategic investments, such as the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos for $4.7 billion, have contributed to their financial prowess. Additionally, their fortune is further strengthened by the ownership of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Rams and Arsenal, through Stan Kroenke's ties to the family.\n\nSpeaking of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), it is also the largest private employer in the US. 15 Industries Which Produce the Most Billionaires\n\nA busy cityscape of financial buildings, emphasizing the importance of the industry for the economy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine industries which produce the most billionaires, we analyzed Forbes' 2023 Billionaires list. By dividing the number of billionaires in each industry by the total number of billionaires on the list, we calculated the percentage share of billionaires for each industry. Consequently, we arranged the industries in ascending order based on their share of billionaires.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Sports\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.4%\n\nIn 2023, a dozen new billionaires emerged from the sports industry, marking a major trend in wealth creation. LeBron James and Tiger Woods notably became the first active athletes to achieve a billion-dollar net worth, symbolizing the immense financial potential within sports. Booming media rights deals have skyrocketed team values and athlete earnings, with 94 of the top 100 US telecasts being sports events. Ownership of sports teams, exemplified by figures like Mark Davis and Amy Adams Strunk, has become a cornerstone asset for many, yielding substantial returns. Given the potential, sports is one of the most powerful future billionaire industries.\n\n14. Logistics\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.5%\n\nThe logistics industry stands out as a surprising source of immense wealth, with only 35 billionaires globally attributing their fortunes to this sector. Among them, eight are Chinese, and six are American. As of March 8, 2023, there are only three female billionaires in logistics. Johnelle Hunt leads the pack with a net worth of $4.5 billion, followed by Xiaojuan Zhang with $1.8 billion, and Liying Chen with $1.1 billion.\n\n13. Construction and Engineering\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.7%\n\nThe construction and engineering industry has unparalleled potential for producing billionaires, evidenced by the net worths of its top figures. Diane Hendricks leads the list with a colossal $22.4 billion fortune, followed by Nassef Sawiris at $8.5 billion, Anthony Bamford at $7.1 billion, and Thomas Schmidheiny at $6.5 billion. Rafael Del Pino and Peter Gilgan claim the fifth and sixth spots with $5.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.\n\n12. Automotive\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.80%\n\nApart from being one of the industries which produce the most billionaires in the world, automotive engineering stands as the breeding ground for billionaire women, like Susanne Klatten, Gail Miller, and Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler, that have amassed huge amounts of wealth. Klatten's strategic investments and BMW ownership contribute to her $26.4 billion fortune, while Miller's diversified business empire yields $3.9 billion. Schaeffler's leadership in auto parts manufacturing, valued at $8.2 billion, highlights the sector's lucrative opportunities.\n\n11. Metals and Mining\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.84%\n\nAs one of the best industries to become a billionaire, the metals and mining industry harbors immense potential for creating billionaires, as evidenced by the incredible net worth figures of its top players. With Savitri Jindal leading the list at $31.1 billion, followed closely by Gina Rinehart with $30.8 billion, it's evident that fortunes in this sector go up to astronomical heights. The industry's top ten billionaires collectively amass over $235 billion, showcasing the immense wealth generation capacity.\n\n10. Media and Entertainment\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 3%\n\nThe media and entertainment industry is globally known as the billionaire-producing powerhouse due to its multifaceted nature and global reach. Giants like Disney, Comcast, and Netflix have capitalized on their innovative content creation, distribution platforms, and strategic acquisitions to amass vast fortunes. Additionally, the convergence of technology with media has birthed moguls like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who capitalized on streaming services through Amazon Prime Video. From film production to streaming services, the industry's ability to capture the attention and wallets of billions worldwide ensures its continuous growth.\n\n9. Energy\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 4%\n\nEnergy is one of the industries that makes the most money in the world and hence, most billionaires. Companies like ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Chevron dominate this landscape, propelled by the perpetual demand for oil, gas, and renewable energy sources. The sector's inherent capital-intensive nature, coupled with its strategic importance in driving economies, fosters immense wealth accumulation for its key players.\n\n8. Diversified\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nComprising 7% of the list, there are 187 billionaires categorized under diversified industries in 2023 by Forbes. The wealthiest among them is Mukesh Ambani, with a net worth of $83.4 billion. Ambani serves as the chairman of Reliance Industries, a conglomerate with investments spanning petrochemicals, oil and gas, retail, and telecommunications sectors, showcasing a wide-ranging portfolio of interests. Hence, it is not wrong to say there are diversified industries which can produce the most billionaires in India.\n\n7. Real Estate\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nAs one of the top 10 industries which produce the most billionaires, real estate comprises 7% of the list with 193 billionaires in 2023.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 jobs that will be in demand in the next 10 years. We have also discussed the latest state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Jobs That Will Be in Demand in the Next 10 Years.\n\nThe February 2024 jobs report revealed a strong addition of 275,000 jobs to the US economy, surpassing expectations and indicating continued strength in the labor market. Despite concerns about high interest rates and inflation, various sectors experienced growth, particularly in construction, retail, and food services, contributing to the unexpected employment surge. However, while job creation exceeded forecasts, there are indications that overall labor market activity may be cooling. Notably, the unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, the highest since January 2022, prompting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to advocate for continued vigilance to assess if employment trends will effectively moderate inflation.\n\nThe industry breakdown sheds light on the breadth of job gains, with sectors like health care, leisure and hospitality, and government leading the charge. Despite some declines in manufacturing jobs, the overall increase in employment across different sectors reflects a resilient labor market. However, revisions to previous months' data and other indicators suggest a potential weakening in labor market conditions. As unemployment rates fluctuate and wage growth remains below expectations, policymakers must carefully monitor economic trends to ensure stability and address inflation concerns effectively.\n\nSpeaking of fluctuation, it is worth highlighting that in February 2024, Mark Zuckerberg revealed Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s pivot towards a leaner operational model, signaling a departure from its previous hiring practices. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), formerly Facebook, declared its inaugural dividend and boasted increasing financial results, propelling its stock to a record high. Zuckerberg emphasized that the efficiency-driven approach adopted in 2023 would persist as a fundamental aspect of the company's operations, indicating a shift away from large-scale hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing two rounds of major layoffs since fall 2022, totaling 22% of its workforce, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s stock improved, reaching over $450 per share in after-hours trading. Zuckerberg outlined plans to continue minimizing headcount and hiring, focusing on recruiting experienced professionals and maintaining a streamlined organization. Despite sustained revenue growth and cost reductions, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s future hiring plans are described as \"relatively minimal\" compared to historical levels.\n\nThe hiring challenges are not just restricted to tech companies alone, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT) has faced major challenges in rebuilding its workforce post-pandemic, particularly within the hospitality industry. Laura Fuentes, the Chief Human Resources Officer at  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT), revealed that the company experienced a drastic shift from hiring over 50,000 people annually to facing layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic. However, with the resurgence of business,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT) has had to re-enter the talent marketplace aggressively, launching a new employer brand marketing campaign to attract talent authentically and strategically. This campaign targets not only traditional HR platforms but also consumer-facing channels to showcase  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT)’s culture and values, aiming to appeal to both guests and potential employees alike.\n\nWhile the overall state of jobs in the US has been strong, according to Indeed's rankings for 2024, mental healthcare professions dominate the list of top jobs in the US. Mental health technicians, therapists, and psychiatrists lead the list, reflecting a growing demand for mental health services. These positions offer attractive salaries, with mental health technicians averaging $77,448 annually and psychiatrists topping the list with an average salary of $258,440. Moreover, many of these roles provide flexibility, with nearly 20% of mental health technician jobs being remote or hybrid, and therapists enjoying a 41% flexibility rate. Owing to the growing flexibility in healthcare jobs, psychologists and mental healthcare professions are likely to be one of the future jobs in demand by 2030. To read about jobs that will be in demand in future, see 20 Jobs That Will be in Demand in the Next 5 Years.\n\nBeyond healthcare, construction and manufacturing sectors also secured a major portion of slots on the list, totaling 32%. Finance roles accounted for 18% of the listed positions. Conversely, tech jobs experienced a decline, representing only 12% of the roles, possibly due to increased layoffs and a shift in popularity among employers. To read about jobs that will be on the decline in the next 10 years, see 30 professions to avoid like a plague.\n\nMoreover, recruitment in the hospitality industry has been challenging due to workforce hesitancy, departures, and increased demand for flexibility. Fuentes highlights the importance of empowering leaders to rethink recruitment strategies, utilizing technology, data analytics, and AI to streamline processes. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT) has also prioritized flexibility for its hourly workers, offering options such as daily pay, upskilling opportunities, and flexible scheduling through partnerships with platforms like Guild and WorkJam.\n\nSpeaking of AI, a recent report suggests that nearly one-fifth of US jobs, spanning various fields like IT operations and mathematics, are at high risk of being influenced by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), capable of performing at least 80% of the required job skills. However, this doesn't imply complete job displacement; rather, it's anticipated that AI will augment human capabilities, potentially leading to more efficient work practices.\n\nMoreover, Indeed.com's analysis of over 55 million job postings indicates that GenAI can handle 50% to nearly 80% of required skills in about 45.7% of job listings, while in 34.6% of jobs, GenAI can manage less than half of the skills. However, occupations demanding manual skills or personal interactions, such as nursing, are less susceptible to AI disruption. Experts continue to stress the importance of workers adapting to AI technologies to remain competitive in the evolving job market. 12 Jobs That Will Be in Demand in the Next 10 Years\n\nAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the jobs that will be in demand in the next 10 years, we identified the jobs with the fastest growing employment rate between 2022 and 2032. We relied on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA for the employment growth rates. The list is presented in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "Why China's options in response to a TikTok ban are limited",
        "content": "Chinese officials decried the lack of “fairness” in the US last week following the swift passage of a House bill that called for Chinese company ByteDance to divest its popular social media app TikTok.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson for China accused the US of using national security as a guise to “willfully suppress other countries' superior companies,” strongly hinting that the Chinese government would block any forced sale of its most popular social media app.\n\nBut beyond preventing a spin-off, Chinese options for potential retaliation against the US remain limited, given the country’s current economic standing and its own policy of censorship, experts say.\n\n“The more that they take sort of retaliatory measures, that actually turbocharges that decoupling agenda that some have in Washington,” said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at The Peterson Institute for International Economics. “[That] would encourage firms to pull out of China because they wouldn't feel safe there.” Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, speaks to the press on March 13, 2024, after the ministry accused the US on Wednesday of bullying Tiktok. (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nChina weighs its options with TikTok\n\nThe latest congressional action marks another twist in a yearslong effort to limit the scale and influence of a social media app that has grown to more than 170 million users in the US.\n\nSince launching in 2017 as the international version of parent company ByteDance’s popular Chinese app Douyin, TikTok has become one of the most downloaded apps globally, along with Meta’s (META) Instagram.\n\nBut the vast amounts of data collected on the platform, as well as concerns about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to exert control over ByteDance, has raised the alarm for US lawmakers who have deemed TikTok’s ties to China a national security risk.\n\nIn congressional testimony, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has insisted that the company stores Americans' data in Virginia and Singapore, not China. However, the company later acknowledged there are some exceptions for creator data, as Forbes reported. Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, leaves a meeting in Sen. John Fetterman's office in the Russell Senate Office building on Thursday, March 14, 2024. (Bill Clark via Getty Images)\n\n“The Chinese government does have broad legal authorities to compel corporations in matters of national security,” said Colin Costello, a CFIUS and national security adviser at the Freshfields law firm. “So from the perspective of someone who views the Chinese government as an adversary and as a very capable adversary, the question is not has it been used, but can it be used? And the answer to that, ... from the perspective of the people who wrote this bill, is yes.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn't the first time Beijing has responded to threats of a US TikTok ban.\n\nIn 2020, after former President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively calling for the ban of TikTok and WeChat in the US, ByteDance immediately moved to update its export control rules. The changes restricted the export of “technology based on data analysis for personalized information recommendation service.”\n\nReva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, expects Beijing to intervene similarly if the Senate passes the House bill and President Joe Biden signs it into law to “demonstrate its own resistance to the US.” Visitors visit the TikTok booth at the Application & Electronics World Expo (AWE2024) in Shanghai, China, on March 14, 2024. (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nBut China’s own economic reality and a broad slowdown in foreign investments may also influence Beijing’s calculation in the scale of its response. Foreign direct investments in China fell to a 30-year low in 2023, weighed down in part by concerns over geopolitical tensions and an unpredictable business environment.\n\n“Beijing needs to weigh the risk of further alienating foreign investors when China’s economic challenges are already on full display,” Goujon said. “More defensive moves, whether on export controls, data security, or cybersecurity measures, will only drive companies deeper down the diversification path.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Beijing from responding in the past. Major American social media and online platforms, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Meta’s Facebook, and Snapchat (SNAP), have already been banned from the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe government also barred critical domestic infrastructure operators from purchasing Micron’s (MU) products last year, after Washington implemented export controls on key American components and chipmaking tools. Months later, China ordered employees at central government agencies to stop using Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, citing national security concerns.\n\nIf passed in the Senate, the TikTok bill sets a six-month deadline for TikTok to divest from ByteDance, a challenging scenario given the complexity of separating US assets from a global app.\n\nChorzempa said Beijing is unlikely to approve any deal, regardless of the price tag or corporate structure, in part because of what TikTok represents: a global social media success story made in China.\n\n“If Beijing is looking at a ban in the United States market compared to losing global control [over an app], it's not clear to me that it would prefer divestment and a payout for the existing shareholders over the loss of that channel,” Chorzempa said.\n\nIn part, he added, that's because the “abundance of Chinese actions in the last few years makes clear that the interests of shareholders and the financial interests of shareholders just do not come in very high on the list of Chinese government priorities.”\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - A divided U.S. appeals court said Meta Platforms must face a class action by advertisers that accused the Facebook and Instagram owner of overcharging them by fraudulently inflating the number of people their ads might reach.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said advertisers could sue for damages as a group over Meta's claims about the \"potential reach\" of their ads.\n\nAdvertisers said the metric measured the number social media accounts, not the lower number of actual people, and inflated the number of potential viewers by as much as 400%.\n\nThe San Francisco-based appeals court also decertified a separate class seeking injunctive relief, meaning the advertisers cannot sue as a group, because it wasn't clear that the main plaintiff had legal standing to sue.\n\nA dissenting judge would have decertified both classes.\n\nMeta and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company has said ads generate \"substantially all\" of its revenue, which totaled $134.9 billion in 2023. Net income was $39.1 billion.\n\nClass actions afford potentially greater recoveries at lower cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually.\n\nCircuit Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for Thursday's majority that because Meta provided the same alleged misrepresentation about potential reach, advertisers could try to prove that their alleged damages stemmed from a \"common course of conduct.\"\n\nThe class covers potentially millions of individuals and businesses that have paid for ads on Facebook and Instagram since Aug. 15, 2014.\n\nTheir lawsuit included a claim that senior executives knew that duplicate and fake accounts, including from bots, inflated the \"potential reach\" metric, but took steps to cover it up.\n\nCircuit Judge Danielle Forrest, in a partial dissent, said she would decertify the damages class because of individualized questions about what advertisers understood about what Meta was telling them before they bought ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nA lawyer for the advertisers had no immediate comment.\n\nThe case is DZ Reserve et al v Meta Platforms Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-15916.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by David Evans)",

        "content": "If you’re one the hunt for top performing stocks to buy this month, look no further. The stock market is still on a hot streak following deceased fears surrounding the compounding issue of inflation and possible interest rate cuts on the horizon. Another aspect of the continued rally in this bullish environment is the impressive growth of the innovation-driven tech sector. These key circumstances have led to a boom in the stock market that shows no sign of stopping.\n\nBelow are a few strong stocks with robust fundamentals and strong earnings growth that have most notably experienced a rapid increase in share price that has left investors speechless.\n\nTop Performing Stocks: SkyWest (SKYW) A close-up shot of a SkyWest (SKYW) plane.\n\nSource: Heather Dunbar / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) operates as a passenger and cargo transport airline that offers leasing services for its fleet of over 500 aircraft.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSkyWest has beaten most consensus concerning its last few earnings reports, which has helped to increase its share price, which has more than tripled within this last year. Its peers, such as JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Frontier Group (NASDAQ:ULCC), have reported negative share price growth within the same time period.\n\nOn Feb. 2, SkyWest reported earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, which stated that total revenue increased 10% compared to the previous year. SkyWest reported a net loss of $47 million in Q4 2022. And in Q4 2023, that changed to a net income of $18 million. It also laid out a timeline for which SkyWest will deliver E175 aircraft to airline companies such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK).\n\nAirlines, especially ones such as SkyWest, have experienced an uptick in travel demand, particularly following a busy holiday season. Investors are still in disbelief that SkyWest is still trading at a relatively low valuation and still has more upside, even after recently being one of the best-performing passenger airline companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates multiple social media applications such as Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger.\n\nOn Feb. 1, it announced earnings results for the fourth quarter full year 2023, which stated that revenue increased by 25% year-over-year (YOY). Earnings per share went from $1.76 in Q4 2022 to $5.33 in Q4 2023. Its daily and monthly active users rose slightly compared to the previous year. Meta also announced an initial quarterly dividend of fifty cents per share.\n\nThe share price of Meta Platforms has increased rapidly this last year, most notably following its last earnings report, in which it surged by 20%. Its share price has grown by over 60% within six months.\n\nIssues surrounding the very popular social media app TikTok and its potential ban within the U.S. could lead to users migrating to other platforms, such as Meta’s Facebook Reels. Meta’s substantial ad revenue growth of 24% YOY and the quarterly dividend payout that Meta just initiated give investors a very positive outlook for the company.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) operates an on-demand transportation application that engages in passenger ground, delivery, and other freight transport.\n\nOver the last year, its share price has more than doubled. On Feb. 7, Uber reported earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that net income increased by 140%, total revenue grew by 15%, and gross booking rose by 22% YOY.\n\nThe outlook for the first quarter of 2024 includes expected gross booking between $37 billion and $38.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $1.26 billion and $1.34 billion.\n\nUber also saw major interest on the part of investors following its press release that announced its first share buyback program, which could total $7 billion in share repurchases. Uber’s CFO stated that this move shows the company is on a strong financial trajectory.\n\nWith its recent announcement of a stock buyback program and strong financial position, Uber could be a solid option for investors looking to gain exposure to the industry, making it one of those top performing stocks to watch.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position in UBER. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "Reddit IPO: The company is ready for more AI and advertising, says CEO",
        "content": "New investors shouldn't call Reddit (RDDT) an AI play even after a lucrative deal with tech beast Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nOr so says co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman.\n\n\"I think they should look at Reddit as a community platform that has many paths to success,\" Huffman told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, as his 19-year old company went public on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nReddit is pursuing more deals that feeds its data to large language models (LLMs), according to Huffman, but the company is also aiming to grab a bigger piece of the advertising pie.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 late Wednesday, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation initially.\n\nThe targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion valuation it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nAs of 12:15 p.m. ET, Reddit shares hadn't yet opened for trading. Indications had it opening in the $42 to $48 a share range.\n\nReddit is the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nThe Road to the Reddit IPO\n\nIt's been a long-winding road for Huffman — an avid ballroom dancer in his college days — and the Reddit team to reach its Thursday IPO.\n\nThe company — which Huffman frequently says is not a social media platform but a democratic community — was founded by Huffman and friend Alexis Ohanian in 2005.\n\nThe pair sold Reddit to Conde Nast a year later for a reported $10 million. Huffman stayed on until his contract ended in 2009. Ohanian left in 2010. Welcome to public markets, Reddit. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nConde Nast's parent company Advance Publications spun off the business in 2011. After churning through two CEOs, Reddit brought back Ohanian as executive chairman in 2014, then Huffman as CEO a year later.\n\nSince then, Huffman has waded into hot button content moderation topics on the platform, run the business during the meme stock uprising, and pivoted the company to capitalize on advertising dollars.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, Reddit struck a $60 million deal to license its data to help train Google's LLMs. The potential for more AI licensing deals were a key pitch to investors during its IPO roadshow.\n\nOhanian left in 2020, noting he wanted his board seat given to a diverse candidate. Interestingly, mentions of him were left out of Reddit's prospectus.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit has never turned a profit. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million. Its daily users tally about 73 million strong.\n\n\"I like the trend we are on,\" Huffman said when asked if adjusted profits achieved in late 2023 would continue in 2024. He declined to say if Reddit would be profitable in 2024.\n\nOther facts to know:\n\nAI kingmaker Sam Altman and Chinese tech giant Tencent are Reddit’s fourth and second largest shareholders, respectively. Huffman’s total 2023 compensation stood at $193.2 million, which includes $93.7 million in options awards and $98.3 million in stock awards. Key call out from its SEC filing: “Our Chief Executive Officer, Steven Huffman, holds 662,447 PRSUs for shares of our Class B common stock that are issuable upon achievement of a vesting condition that will be deemed satisfied based on our attaining a $5.0 billion market capitalization valuation following this offering.” The GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) meme stock trading saga was mentioned in the company’s risk factor section. 1.76 million shares were reserved for the Reddit user base to buy.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are set to face full-blown European Union investigations into their compliance with a new law reining in the power of Big Tech, paving the way for potentially hefty fines.\n\nThe European Commission is gearing up to announce probes into the firms’ compliance with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple and Google’s new fees, terms and conditions for app store developers will come under the EU’s focus, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA proposal from Meta Platforms Inc. to leverage a monthly fee on users for accessing Facebook and Instagram could also garner future EU scrutiny under the bloc’s new powers, the people added.\n\nThe heightened EU scrutiny against Apple comes as the US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general sued the firm on Thursday, accusing the iPhone maker of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.\n\nThe DMA — which lays out a series of dos and dont’s for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows the bloc to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules. After starting formal investigations, regulators aim to wrap up their final decisions within a period of 12 months.\n\nThe commission in Brussels declined to comment. Apple, Google and Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple, fresh from its €1.8 billion ($2 billion) EU fine for blocking music streaming apps from informing users of cheaper deals, has been under heavy scrutiny since the DMA came into full effect on March 7.\n\nSpotify, which triggered the initial EU complaint over the App Store, said Apple’s DMA proposals to levy additional charges on developers were “unacceptable” and “nonsensical” and requested a meeting with the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager. Apple had proposed to scrap the 30% commission it has historically imposed, but also added new charges.\n\n—With assistance from Stephanie Bodoni.\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The Justice Department filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging that the tech giant illegally maintains its dominance over its iPhone ecosystem by boxing out competing services from other companies.\n\nApple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said \"threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\n\nA victory for the US in this case \"would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,\" Apple added in its statement.\n\nApple's stock was down roughly 3% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.\n\nThe filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws. Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Loren Elliott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nThe DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start to 2024.\n\nShares of Apple are down 7% year-to-date, as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title of the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on Twitter @alexiskweed.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "Wall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. AI-centered stocks rallied last year and the momentum continues into this year, with a large number of companies trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Fed Reaffirms Three Rate Cuts This Year: 5 Technology Picks",
        "content": "On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023. Its current level marks the highest in 23 years. Since the beginning of 2024, market participants have been busy predicting when the central bank will cut interest rate first time.\n\nRecently, a large section of financial researchers and economists were worried about the rate cut as the inflation rate remains sticky supported by a resilient labor market, increasing wage rate and strong consumer spending. However, in a relief to investors, the Fed reiterated the number of interest rate cuts that it had indicated in the December FOMC meeting.\n\nFed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate to come down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nIn his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this type of cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.”\n\nFollowing the March FOMC decision, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 75% probability that the first rate cut will come in the June FOMC meeting. This probability was 60% just before Powell’s post-FOMC statement.\n\nConsequently, Wall Street rallied to record highs. The broad-market index — the S&P 500 — closed at 5,224.62 after hitting an all-time high of 5,226.19. The benchmark closed above 5,200 for the first time. The blue-chip Dow recorded an all-time high of 39,529.13 and a closing high of 39,512.13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a new closing high of 16,369.41.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Sectors to Benefit\n\nDespite its higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. Investment in growth stocks creates wealth over a long period of time.\n\nA lower market interest rate will decrease the discount rate, which in turn will raise the net present value of investment. Moreover, many of these companies depend on the chip source of credit for the business to grow.\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $35 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 71% and 82.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the past seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the past 30 days. The stock price of META has jumped 42.8% year to date.\n\nVeeva Systems Inc.’s VEEV continued focus on research and development and a strong product portfolio buoy optimism. VEEV has also been witnessing robust customer adoption of its products, which is encouraging.\n\nVEEV has inked a few strategic alliances over the past few months. A strong liquidity position is an added plus. We expect total revenues and adjusted earnings per share are likely to witness a CAGR of 12.8% and 11.7% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026, respectively.\n\nVeeva Systems has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.8% and 25.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.9% over the past 30 days. The stock price of VEEV has climbed 19.6% year to date.\n\nSynopsys Inc. SNPS is benefiting from solid design wins due to a robust product portfolio. Growth in the hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for SNPS’ Fusion Compiler product is boosting its top line. The growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects for SNPS. Moreover, the rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things and big data is driving investments in new computing and machine learning architectures.\n\nSynopsys has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.2% and 21.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the past 30 days. The stock price of SNPS has advanced 14.6% year to date.\n\nCadence Design Systems Inc.

        "title": "Buy 5 High ROE Stocks as Fed Holds Rates, Promises 3 Cuts",
        "content": "The leading benchmark indices notched all-time closing highs yesterday as the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, in line with widespread expectations. Despite the federal funds rate level (in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%) being the highest in more than 23 years, the Fed kept the rates unchanged and pledged to cut the same thrice in 2024. This propelled the stock markets to record highs on optimism that the rate cuts will buoy the economic growth, which is projected to grow at a 2.1% annualized rate, up from 1.4% expected in December.\r\n\r\nThe recent spate of inflationary pressures, like that exhibited by the high Producer Price Index reading for February, had cast doubts over Fed’s proposed rate cuts this year. The higher-than-expected inflation data in the first two months of 2024 triggered caution from some Fed officials, while the markets appeared vulnerable to sudden downtrends owing to tempered expectations. However, following its two-day policy meeting, the central bank kept its benchmark borrowing rate unchanged and penciled in three quarter-percentage-point cuts by the end of this year.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and W. R. Berkley Corporation WRB are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nParameters Used for Screening\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nIron Mountain: Boston, MA-based Iron Mountain provides records & information management services and data center space & solutions in 59 countries. The company primarily generates revenues from storage rental and services. Storage rental revenues are generated through periodic rental charges for data storage. Service revenues comprise charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 4%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.5%, on average. Iron Mountain sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nSuzano: Headquartered in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano produces and sells eucalyptus pulp and paper products. With more than 90 years of experience, this vertically integrated firm is one of the largest producers of paper and graphic products in South America. \r\n\r\nThe company offers coated and uncoated printing and writing papers, paperboards, tissue papers and lignin. Suzano carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nTapestry: Founded in 1941 and headquartered in New York, Tapestry (formerly known as Coach, Inc.) is the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally. The company offers lifestyle products, which include handbags, women’s and men’s accessories, footwear, jewelry, seasonal apparel collections, sunwear, travel bags, fragrances and watches. \r\n\r\nTapestry has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.7%, on average. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of A.\r\n\r\nMeta: Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple photo and video-sharing apps like Instagram and WhatsApp through acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 19.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.7%, on average. Meta sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nW. R. Berkley: Founded in 1967 and based in Greenwich, CT., W.R. Berkley is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers. The company offers a variety of insurance services, from reinsurance to workers comp third-party administrators.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%. It has a VGM Score of B.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "Investing doesn't always have to be about finding the next big thing. Sometimes, buying and holding what's already a great business is the better option in the technology space. Some companies dominate technology and have the size and deep pockets to protect their interests from competition.\n\nThese megacap tech stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, have turned individual investors into millionaires.\n\nCan that continue? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is a table-pounding buy today.\n\nHere are the three that are:\n\n1. Nvidia: AI chip dominance spells a bright future\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The reason? It became the go-to AI chip company, enjoying a market share between 80% and 90% today. That's launched the stock upward by a blistering 500% since the start of 2023. Today, Nvidia's $2.1 trillion market cap makes it one of the largest corporations on the planet. So, how can the party keep going? Believe it or not, Nvidia still has millionaire-making potential over the long term.\n\nCompanies worldwide are implementing AI into their products and services. AI is certainly no fluke. The more AI spreads, the higher the demand for powerful data centers to power it. Nvidia's CEO believes there is a need for over a trillion dollars in additional data center spending over the coming years. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's chief rival, believes the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion.\n\nIf you annualized Nvidia's fourth-quarter data center revenue, the resulting $72 billion is a fraction of the potential market. Even if competition eats away at Nvidia's market share, it's hard to see a collapse. Suppose market share falls to 50%. Half of a $400 billion market is still three times Nvidia's annualized Q4 data center revenue. In other words, Nvidia's AI growth trend could continue for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nNumbers-wise, analysts believe Nvidia will grow earnings by an average of 30% annually over the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37 today, arguably cheap for a company with such high expected growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: The social media giant with room to run\n\nUnder Co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has become the king of social media. Today, nearly 4 billion people use any one of Meta's four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp each month. A social media company doesn't jump out as an AI stock, but Meta is very much one. The company makes its money by advertising to its billions of users.\n\nAI is behind the scenes, choosing which content to show users to maximize their time and engagement on the app. It's helping advertisers craft compelling ads and finding the best users to show them to. Zuckerberg is also passionate about Reality Labs, an AI and metaverse business unit investing billions of dollars in research and development of augmented reality hardware and other technologies.\n\nMeta's user base grew by 6% in 2023, an impressive feat considering it grew from such a large base. This shows how good Meta Platforms is at social media, and it could grow even more potent if the United States takes action to ban TikTok because of owner ByteDance's ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Meta is a cash cow repurchasing shares and has just started paying investors dividends.\n\nMeanwhile, shares trade at a forward P/E of 24, an attractive price tag for a business that experts believe can grow earnings by 20% annually for the next three to five years. Shareholders are poised to enjoy billions of dollars raining down on them for dividends and repurchases, making Meta a potentially potent millionaire-maker.\n\n3. Alphabet: Don't count this stock out when it comes to AI\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has dominated internet search for two decades. The company maintains a roughly 90% share of global searches, making Google the world's most trafficked website. Second place? Video search platform YouTube, owned by ... you guessed it, Alphabet. The two sites create lucrative advertising opportunities, the golden goose that Alphabet has ridden to a trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nThere is some fear that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots could disrupt Google Search and cripple Alphabet's lucrative empire. However, don't rush to count Alphabet out. The company has launched AI tools of its own, and Google benefits from 20 years of brand power. Google is synonymous with internet search, and that won't be easy to change overnight.\n\nRemember that Alphabet is still one of the most influential companies on Earth. It generates $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies do in sales. It's not impossible, but breaching Alphabet's moat won't be easy.\n\nToday, shares trade at a forward P/E of 21, while analysts expect 16% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years. That makes Alphabet a potential bargain if it can ward off the pressure from ChatGPT and other rivals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Palantir Technologies Looks Deeply Undervalued",
        "content": "Software intelligence company Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) looks very undervalued currently given its underlying growth and powerful free cash flow. It could be worth at least 30% more.\n\nPalantir's value is rooted in its strong growth. The company reported on Feb. 5 that its fourth-quarter 2023 revenue was up 20% year over year and was even 9% higher than the prior quarter.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PLTR.\n\nMoreover, the company showed strong growth in 2023, up 17% over the prior year. Palantir has also delivered good continuous growth, as seen in the chart below. Palantir Technologies Looks Deeply Undervalued\n\nSource: CEO letter Feb 5, 2024\n\nFor example, since 2020, the company has more than doubled sales. Sales are up 103.50% from $1.09 billion to $2.23 billion in that period. That represents a compounded average annual growth rate of 26.70% annually for the past three years.\n\nMost of the company's clients are government agencies, especially federal intelligence agencies. Palantir's 10-K annual report says that 55% of its sales were from government sources and 45% from commercial clients. But the CEO's recent letter makes it clear he expects that growth is surging from its commercial clients, including potential artificial intelligence clients.\n\nFor example, its U.S. commercial revenue rose 36.40% in 2023 to $457 million and was up 70% year over year in the fourth quarter alone. One reason is that Palantir can now set up data integration and analytical software programs with a client's existing systems in hours rather than weeks and months.\n\nMoreover, its Artificial Intelligence Program is not only quickly gaining customers and is not only its fourth principal software platform (in addition to Gotham, Foundry and Apollo), but CEO Alex Karp said in his letter to shareholders it is the future of the company.\n\nThis is because its government and commercial clients must integrate large language models and related AI software programs with their existing systems. Palantir's AIP not only helps with this LLM integration, but also allows integration with its other software platforms that clients may be using.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bottom line is that analysts continue to see huge sales growth going forward. For example, the average forecast of analysts surveyed shows revenue growing to $2.68 billion in 2024, up 20.40% from $2.23 billion in 2023. And for 2025, they predict $3.23 billion in sales, up $1 billion or 45% from 2023.\n\nStrong profits and free cash flow\n\nPalantir is already very profitable and this growth could make it even more valuable. Its adjusted income from operations in the fourth quarter was $209.35 million, or 34% of its $608.35 million in quarterly revenue. Palantir Technologies Looks Deeply Undervalued\n\nSource: Q4 Earnings Release\n\nMore importantly, its adjusted free cash flow was $304.75 million, which represented 50% of the quarterly revenue. And for full-year 2023, its adjusted free cash flow margin was 32.8.% (i.e., $730.50 million on $2.23 billion in sales).\n\nThat is a very high FCF margin, among the highest of large software companies. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated 30% free cash flow margins during 2023, based on $67.50 billion in FCF on $227.60 billion in sales. Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) recently reported its trailing 12-month FCF was $12.25 billion on $52.50 billion in sales or an FCF margin of 23.30%.\n\nFCF forecast\n\nThis implies Palantir may generate a good deal of free cash flow this year. For example, using analysts' forecasts referred to earlier works out to an average next 12 months run rate of revenue of almost $3 billion (i.e., $2.96 billion is the average of analysts' $2.68 billion sales forecast for 2024 and $3.23 billion for 2025).\n\nSo applying its 2023 adjusted free cash flow margin of 32.80% to this NTM $2.96 billion revenue forecast produces a FCF estimate of $971 million.\n\nIn fact, Palantir itself gave a forecast that it would make between $800 million and $1 billion in adjusted FCF during 2024.\n\nBut if the company keeps making 50% FCF margins as during the fourth quarter, it is possible it could generate substantially more free cash flow. That could push the stock much higher.\n\nUsing FCF yield metrics to value Palantir\n\nOne way to value Palantir is to assume it pays out all its free cash flow as a dividend. If that occurred, the stock would likely have at least a 1.50% dividend yield. This is known as an FCF yield metric to value a stock.\n\nThe FCF yield at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which just announced its first-ever dividend, is much lower (i.e., valued higher). Meta's stock has a 0.43% dividend yield.\n\nAnd look at Microsoft's FCF yield. Last year, it generated $67.50 billion in free cash flow and the stock has a market value of $3.16 trillion. That means its FCF yield is now 2.13%. This is the same as multiplying FCF by 46.80.\n\nPalantir has a higher FCF margin than Microsoft (i.e., 50% versus 30%), so it could theoretically be valued at least 50% more.\n\nSetting a price target\n\nValuing Palantir's stock 50% more than Microsoft means using a 70 times free cash flow multiple versus 46.80 at Microsoft. This is the same as using a 1.42% FCF yield (i.e., the inverse of 70 times).\n\nSo using a $1 billion in adjusted FCF estimate for Palantir means the stock could be worth $70 billion. That is 29.60% more than its present market cap of $54 billion.\n\nAnd remember the $1 billion forecast is based on a 33.80% FCF margin (i.e., $1 billion/$2.96 billion in NTM sales). If Palantir generates a 50% free cash flow margin in the next 12 months (NTM), it could make $1.48 billion in adjusted FCF. So using a multiple of 70 (or a 1.42% FCF yield) implies the market cap could rise to $103.60 billion. That is 92% higher than the current $54 billion market cap.\n\nTherefore, the stock could be worth 30% more at $30.71 per share (i.e., 1.29 x $23.70). That could take up to one year to occur. On the upper end, the stock could be worth 92% more, or $45.50 per share.\n\nThe bottom line is Palantir looks substantially undervalued based on its powerful free cash flow margins.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq’s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company’s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA’s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC’s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company’s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n“AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.”\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.

Next, we checked each stock’s analyst ratings and price targets on TipRanks. We then chose the 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside at the time of writing on March 18 and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of Q4, 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n10. Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 22.99%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is a Texas-based company that offers energy and industrial solutions. According to TipRanks, the stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 14 Wall Street analysts that covered it over the past three months. The average price target of $39.85 implies an upside of 22.99% from the current levels at the time of writing on March 18.\n\nOn February 21, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) announced that it won a significant and multi-year award for the provision of integrated well construction services for rigs in the Buzios pre-salt field offshore Brazil. The work on the three rigs is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) was part of 47 hedge funds’ portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a total stake value of $911.825 million. AQR Capital Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth nearly $137.851 million, as of Q4, 2023.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is one of the top NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Performance was boosted in the quarter by the Strategy’s more economically-sensitive holdings among steady compounders and evolving opportunities. Oilfield equipment and services provider Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), meanwhile, benefited from a $20 rise in crude oil prices as well as disciplined execution.”\n\n9. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds had stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) with total positions worth $1.197 billion. This is compared to 44 funds with positions worth $938.370 million in the preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $288.885 million.\n\nOn February 7, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) announced that its Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor received CE Mark approval.\n\nIn the past three months, 12 Wall Street analysts have covered Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), and 9 maintain a Buy rating on the stock. At the time of writing on March 18, the average price target of $238.33 has an upside of 44.79% from present levels.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Results were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet’s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.”\n\n8. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 50.15%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nFirst Solar, Inc.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management’s ability to deliver going forward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor’s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Election misinformation is a problem in any language. But some gets more attention than others",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Warnings about deepfakes and disinformation fueled by artificial intelligence. Concerns about campaigns and candidates using social media to spread lies about elections. Fears that tech companies will fail to address these issues as their platforms are used to undermine democracy ahead of pivotal elections.\n\nThose are the worries facing elections in the U.S., where most voters speak English. But for languages like Spanish, or in dozens of nations where English isn't the dominant language, there are even fewer safeguards in place to protect voters and democracy against the corrosive effects of election misinformation. It's a problem getting renewed attention in an election year in which more people than ever will go to the polls.\n\nTech companies have faced intense political pressure in countries like the U.S. and places like the European Union to show they're serious about tackling the baseless claims, hate speech and authoritarian propaganda that pollutes their sites. But critics say they've been less responsive to similar concerns from smaller countries or from voters who speak other languages, reflecting a longtime bias toward English, the U.S. and other western democracies.\n\nRecent changes at tech firms — content moderator layoffs and decisions to rollback some misinformation policies — have only compounded the situation, even as new technologies like artificial intelligence make it easier than ever to craft lifelike audio and video that can fool voters.\n\nThese gaps have opened up opportunities for candidates, political parties or foreign adversaries looking to create electoral chaos by targeting non-English speakers — whether they are Latinos in the U.S., or one of the millions of voters in India, for instance, who speak a non-English language.\n\n“If there’s a significant population that speaks another language, you can bet there’s going to be disinformation targeting them,” said Randy Abreu, an attorney at the U.S.-based National Hispanic Media Council, which created the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition to track and identify disinformation targeting Latino voters in the U.S. “The power of artificial intelligence is now making this an even more frightening reality.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the big tech companies regularly tout their efforts to safeguard elections, and not just in the U.S. and E.U. This month Meta is launching a service on WhatsApp that will allow users to flag possible AI deepfakes for action by fact-checkers. The service will work in four languages — English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.\n\nMeta says it has teams monitoring for misinformation in dozens of languages, and the company has announced other election-year policies for AI that will apply globally, including required labels for deepfakes as well as labels for political ads created using AI. But those rules have not taken effect and the company hasn't said when they will begin enforcement.\n\nThe laws governing social media platforms vary by nation, and critics of tech companies say they have been faster to address concerns about misinformation in the U.S. and the E.U., which has recently enacted new lawsdesigned to address the problem. Other nations all-too often get a “cookie cutter” response from tech companies that falls short, according to an analysis published this month by the Mozilla Foundation.\n\nThe study looked at 200 different policy announcements from Meta, TikTok, X and Google (the owner of YouTube) and found that nearly two-thirds were focused on the U.S. or E.U. Actions in those jurisdictions were also more likely to involve meaningful investments of staff and resources, the foundation found, while new policies in other nations were more likely to rely on partnerships with fact-checking organizations and media literacy campaigns.\n\nOdanga Madung, a Nairobi, Kenya-based researcher who conducted Mozilla’s study, said it became clear that the platforms' focus on the U.S. and E.U. comes at the expense of the rest of the world.\n\n“It’s a glaring travesty that platforms blatantly favor the U.S. and Europe with excessive policy coddling and protections, while systematically neglecting” other regions, Madung said.\n\nThis lack of focus on other regions and languages will increase the risk that election misinformation could mislead voters and impact the results of elections. Around the globe, the claims are already circulating.\n\nWithin the U.S., voters whose primary language is something other than English are already facing a wave of misleading and baseless claims, Abreau said. Claims targeting Spanish speakers, for instance, include posts that overstate the extent of voter fraud or contain false information about casting a ballot or registering to vote.\n\nDisinformation about elections has surged in Africa ahead of recent elections, according to a study this month from the Africa Center for Strategic Studies which identified dozens of recent disinformation campaigns — a four-fold increase from 2022. The false claims included baseless allegations about candidates, false information about voting and narratives that seem designed to undermine support for the United States and United Nations.\n\nThe center determined that some of the campaigns were mounted by groups allied with the Kremlin, while others were spearheaded by domestic political groups.\n\nIndia, the world's largest democracy, boasts more than a dozen languages each with more than 10 million native speakers. It also has more than 300 million Facebook users and nearly half a billion WhatsApp users, the most of any nation.\n\nFact-checking organizations have emerged as the front line of defense against viral misinformation about elections. The country will hold elections later this spring and already voters going online to find out about the candidates and issues are awash in false and misleading claims.\n\nAmong the latest: video of a politician's speech that was carefully edited to remove key lines; years-old photos of political rallies passed off as new; and a fake election calendar that provided the wrong dates for voting.\n\nA lack of significant steps by tech companies has forced groups that advocate for voters and free elections to band together, said Ritu Kapur, co-founder and managing director of The Quint, an online publication that recently joined with several other outlets and Google to create a new fact-checking effort known as Shakti.\n\n“Mis- and disinformation is proliferating at an alarming pace, aided by technology and fueled and funded by those who stand to gain by it,\" Kapur said. “The only way to combat the malaise is to join forces.”",

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nThe resurgence in US stocks, buoyed by what's been labeled the \"most-crowded trade,\" underscores the market's resilience. Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company's market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve's decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan's Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo & Company raised their price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares from $141.00 to $144.00 while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating for the stock. This adjustment signifies the bank's updated assessment of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) valuation and outlook within the technology sector. The move by Wells Fargo & Company reflects their analysis of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) performance and potential future growth opportunities. By increasing the price target, they indicate their belief that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is poised for appreciation, although the specific upside potential is not provided. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), operating in the technology industry, is renowned for its diverse portfolio of products and services, including its dominant search engine, advertising platform, and cloud computing solutions. The company's continued innovation and expansion efforts contribute to its appeal among investors. The decision to maintain an \"equal weight\" rating suggests a balanced view of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock, neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Investors may interpret the revised price target as a signal of confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) long-term prospects. It provides guidance for investors evaluating their positions in Alphabet, offering insights into the potential trajectory of the stock price.\n\n09. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)\n\nUpside Potential: 0.60%\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo analyst Jeffrey Donnelly affirmed his Equal-Weight rating for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) while increasing the price target from $234 to $250. This adjustment reflects Wells Fargo's updated assessment of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) valuation and prospects within the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) operates in the hospitality sector and is renowned for its global portfolio of hotels and resorts spanning various brands and segments. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as travel trends, economic conditions, and competition within the industry. By raising the price target, Wells Fargo indicates a modest upside potential of 0.60% for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) stock compared to its current market price of $248.52. This suggests that while Wells Fargo remains relatively neutral on Marriott's prospects, they still see some room for appreciation in the stock. Maintaining an Equal-Weight rating suggests that Wells Fargo believes Marriott's stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions.\n\nVulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott’s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott’s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company’s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet. Additionally, average daily rates (ADR) on corporate travel have returned to pre-Covid levels.”\n\n08. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nUpside Potential: 6%\n\nOn March 18, Piper Sandler updated its outlook on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), a leading company in the consulting and professional services industry. They raised the price target on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) from $335 to $394 while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment reflects Piper Sandler's assessment of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) performance and prospects within the competitive landscape of consulting and professional services. Accenture operates in an industry characterized by providing a wide range of services to businesses worldwide, including strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations. With the increase in price target, Piper Sandler indicates a potential upside of 6% for Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock compared to its current market price of $372.67. This suggests that while Piper Sandler sees some room for appreciation, they remain relatively neutral on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) outlook.\n\nThe Neutral rating implies that Piper Sandler believes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions. This rating takes into consideration various factors, including Accenture's financial performance, competitive position, and growth prospects in the consulting and professional services sector. Piper Sandler expects Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) second-quarter results to meet expectations, with revenue likely to be in-line amid muted market expectations. However, they anticipate the company may adjust the top end of its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of 2%-5% due to a potentially slower path to second-half acceleration. Particularly, the consensus for third-quarter growth of +7.4% quarter-over-quarter appears ambitious, according to Piper Sandler. The analysis also highlights historical trends, noting that Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has not experienced a similar level of improvement between the second and third quarters since 2017. Additionally, Piper Sandler underscores the importance of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) commentary on the macroeconomic environment, as industry peers have differing views on the timing of enterprise spend acceleration. This commentary will likely be closely monitored by investors for insights into Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) future performance and industry trends.\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n07. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nOn March 18, BofA Securities provided an updated assessment of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), a prominent player in the electrical equipment industry. Analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and revised the price target upwards from $320 to $325. This adjustment reflects BofA Securities' analysis of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) performance and outlook within the competitive landscape of the electrical equipment sector. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) operates in an industry characterized by providing a diverse range of electrical products and services to various sectors, including industrial, commercial, and residential markets. With the increase in the price target, BofA Securities suggests a potential upside of 10% for Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock compared to its current market price of $298.75. This indicates BofA Securities' optimism about the company's growth prospects and market positioning. The Buy rating signifies BofA Securities' belief that Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock offers attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. The increased price target reflects BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to deliver strong performance and create value for shareholders. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, BofA Securities reaffirms their positive outlook on Eaton Corp and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to generate sustained growth and shareholder returns in the dynamic landscape of the electrical equipment sector.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While renewable stocks have come under pressure of late, energy efficiency and decarbonization remain strong drivers for our industrials holdings, where Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) and Trane Technologies (TT) were strong contributors. Eaton, whose electrical equipment enables the electrification of the power grid and electrical vehicle charging infrastructure, is benefiting from tax incentives supporting clean energy, growth in reshoring and expanding manufacturing in North America and the need for grid resiliency amid broad demand for electrification.”\n\n06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nUpside Potential: 13%\n\nOn March 18, Loop Capital provided an updated analysis of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), a leading player in the streaming entertainment industry. Analyst Alan Gould reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and adjusted the price target upward from $585 to $700. This update reflects Loop Capital's assessment of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) performance and outlook within the highly competitive streaming entertainment sector. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) operates in an industry characterized by providing digital streaming services for a wide range of entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, and original productions. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as subscriber growth, content acquisition, and competition from other streaming platforms. With the increase in the price target, Loop Capital suggests a potential upside of 13% for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock compared to its current market price of $618.39. This indicates Loop Capital's confidence in the company's growth prospects and market position.\n\nThe Buy rating signifies Loop Capital's belief that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock presents attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, Loop Capital reiterates their positive outlook on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores Loop Capital's confidence in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to innovate and capture market share in the evolving landscape of streaming entertainment.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth.

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms is not expecting to receive shipments of Nvidia's new flagship artificial intelligence chip this year, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nNvidia, the dominant designer of GPU (graphics processing unit) chips needed to power most cutting-edge artificial intelligence work, announced the new B200 \"Blackwell\" chip at its annual developer conference on Monday.\n\nThe chip maker said the B200 is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots, although it did not give specific details about how well it performs when chewing through huge amounts data to train those chatbots, which is the kind of work that has powered most of Nvidia's soaring sales.\n\nNvidia's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told financial analysts on Tuesday that \"we think we're going to come to market later this year,\" but also said that shipment volume for the new GPUs would not ramp up until 2025.\n\nSocial media giant Meta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, after buying hundreds of thousands of its previous generation of chips to support pushes into amped-up content recommendations systems and generative AI products.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg disclosed in January that the company planned to have about 350,000 of those earlier chips, called H100s, in its stockpile by the end of the year. In combination with other GPUs, he added, Meta would have the equivalent of about 600,000 H100s by then.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Zuckerberg said Meta planned to use Blackwell to train the company's Llama models. The company is currently training a third generation of the model on two GPU clusters it announced last week, which it said each contain around 24,000 H100 GPUs.\n\nMeta planned to continue using those clusters to train Llama 3 and would use Blackwell for future generations of the model, the Meta spokesperson said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Jose; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday warned Apple and Meta Platforms on their new fees for their services, saying that this may hinder users from enjoying the benefits of the Digital Markets Act which aims to give them more choices.\n\nApple announced a slew of changes in January in a bid to comply with the landmark EU tech legislation which requires it to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.\n\nA new fee structure includes a core technology fee of 50 euro cents per user account per year that major app developers will have to pay even if they do not use any of Apple's payment services, which has triggered criticism from rivals such as Fortnite creator Epic Games.\n\nVestager said the new fees have attracted her attention.\n\n\"There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating,\" she told Reuters in an interview.\n\nVestager expressed her reservations on Meta's new fees.\n\nThe company earlier on Tuesday said it has offered to almost halve its monthly subscription fee for Facebook and Instagram to 5.99 euros from 9.99 euros but Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems said the issue is not about the level of the fee.\n\n\"I think there are many different ways to monetize the services that you provide. Because one thing are the very targeted advertising that builds on data being consumed. Another way of showing your advertising is to make that contextual,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think it's important to continue the conversation with Meta and we will assess also finally, what is the next push in order for them to be compliant with the DMA.\"\n\nVestager also warned companies against discouraging users from switching to rivals by disparaging them, saying this kind of behaviour could trigger an investigation. Apple has said some of its changes could expose users to security risks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I would think of it as unwise to say that the services are not safe to use, because that has nothing to do with the DMA. The DMA is there to open the market for other service providers to get to you and how your service provider of your operating system, how they will make sure that it is safe is for them to decide,\" she said.\n\n\"And of course, if we see or get the suspicion that this is in order to say that someone else are not doing their job of course, we might take initiatives to look into that.\"\n\nVestager said feedback from developers was key to whether she would launch investigations into any of the six companies subjected to the DMA.\n\nAsked whether she had received any comments from third parties, she said: \"Quite a lot, I would say.\"\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "title": "I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.",
        "content": "The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst. Pets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.\n\nBut, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?\n\nThe S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?\n\nI don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term. The Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years? As we say in the part of the world in which I live: fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nAllan Sloan is an award-winning journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Investors look for equities with the potential for rapid returns in their pursuit of profitable investments. Several blue-chip stocks are expected to continue to perform well, providing a mix of both cash flow stability and long-term growth.\n\nThese top players in the field, who offer stability and growth, cover sectors ranging from digital technology to pharmaceuticals. Businesses with large user bases and leadership in digital payment get more growth through technology utilization and strategic relationships.\n\nEven with the market’s record highs and year-long rise, it’s getting harder to sniff out undervalued blue-chip stocks. High valuations carry a danger of sudden price dips. Still, certain undervalued blue chip stocks open doors to stability and reliable returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEvery investor should own these three blue chips and be open to great opportunities.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nWe once knew it to be the world’s most valuable company.\n\nHowever, since giving up its crown Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders may not need to worry. The company’s weak performance this year may be concerning, as revenue continues to decline despite still sky-high revenues. As analysis shows, it is noted that the price targets go from $158.00 to $250.00 with a $201.41 mean.\n\nHowever, light appears on the horizon for long-term investors. Recently, AAPL surged higher after the company reportedly bought Canadian AI startup DarwinAI. This deal highlights the company’s focus on this space, and that its AI initiatives are beginning to roll. In early 2024, Apple integrated the DarwinAI team, with Apple’s CEO hinting at future advancements in AI. This happened despite the company trailing behind rivals like Microsoft and Google.\n\nFurther, Apple dropped plans for electric cars and turned its attention toward generative AI, teasing a big AI reveal. Apple’s stock is still cheaper than competitors like Amazon and Tesla, with a healthy gross margin of about 45%, at 26-times forward profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarting as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become a top player in technology, especially in virtual reality (VR) stocks. Known for its Rift and Quest VR headsets, Meta’s Oculus divisions led immersive gaming experiences with a transition to the metaverse.\n\nThe rise of Reels brings out Meta Platforms’ rule on social media. Its ad impressions increased by 28% in 2023 year over year (YOY). Temu, owned by PDD in China, became Meta’s biggest advertiser, spending around $2 billion on ads. In light of Meta’s dividend buzz, the change shows PDD’s intention to expand Temu in the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, experts believe that fiscal 2024 revenue will surpass $158.2 billion, a 17.3% boost from the last year. Also, they anticipate 2025 sales to cross $178 billion. With a $528.80 price target, experts rank its shares a strong buy, putting Meta with the top dogs of VR stocks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffet’s $364 billion Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio, which includes Apple and other blue-chip stocks, continues to attract investors looking for stock inspiration. Apple controls 43% of the portfolio, and Buffet reaps the rewards from his initial 2016 investment. Additionally, this led to a 374% skyrocket in the stock by March 8.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, unlike IT firms solely focused on AI and data, has experienced growth thanks to its varied sectoral investments. Diversity locks in stability and facilitates strategic capital adjustments. And Buffet’s seasoned experience raises Berkshire’s appeal, providing a sanctuary during market volatility.\n\nThe company’s Q4 operating income grew 28% to $8.48 billion, boosted by a 28% increase in buybacks, expected to total $2.2 billion. Barron’s listed BRK-B with its top ten picks, believing after-tax operating products to shoot through $40 billion in 2024.

        "content": "Roblox RBLX recently introduced Avatar Auto Setup and Texture Generator, two new tools to speed up 3D content creation. These tools are powered by Roblox's AI and aim to make the process faster and easier for creators.\r\n\r\nAvatar Auto Setup simplifies the process of creating avatars by automatically converting 3D body meshes into live, animated avatars with just a click. Previously, this process could take days but now it only takes minutes, thanks to Auto Setup.\r\n\r\nTexture Generator lets creators experiment with different looks for their 3D objects by using text prompts. For instance, if a creator wants to create a texture for a wooden treasure chest, they can describe what they want and the Texture Generator will create a texture that matches their description.\r\n\r\nBoth Avatar Auto Setup and Texture Generator are designed to help creators iterate and scale their projects faster, removing the need to spend hours on manual avatar setup and texturing tasks. These tools are part of Roblox's efforts to empower its community of creators with advanced technologies to enhance the creative processes.\r\n\r\nThese innovations are expected to boost the company’s daily active users (DAUs) and total hours engaged in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RBLX’s 2024 DAUs is pegged at 81,479, indicating year-over-year growth of 19.1%. The consensus mark for total hours engaged is pegged at 71,287.1, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.7%.\n\nRoblox Corporation Price and Consensus Roblox Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nRoblox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Roblox Corporation Quote\n\nRBLX’s Recent AI Efforts to Fend Off Competition\n\nRoblox has been using AI to introduce new features on its platform, such as the full rollout of Code Assist and automatic chat translations in February 2024. During the 11-month beta of Code Assist, which suggests lines of code as creators’ type, users adopted about 300 million characters of suggested code. Toya Play's software development team reported a 5% increase in efficiency using Code Assist, thus saving them months of work.\r\n\r\nSince the launch of automatic chat translations, users worldwide can easily communicate regardless of language. In just 30 days, usage of Roblox’s TextChatService, which supports this feature in creators’ experiences, has more than doubled. This surge in engagement has led to 19.7 billion translated messages so far, making up about one-third of all messages sent on Roblox. It has also provided valuable feedback from international users to creators.\r\n\r\nThese new Roblox features are expected to gain customer attention and fend off competition from big players.\r\n\r\nShares of this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 20.8% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s 1.3% growth due to tough competition from big players like Meta Platforms META, Qualcomm QCOM and NVIDIA NVDA. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has been exploring the metaverse since its rebranding in late 2021, leading in AR and VR technologies. Meta is now integrating AI into its metaverse strategy, aiming to revolutionize virtual environments. This includes implementing AI-driven features like voice commands through its Builder Bot project and introducing custom AI chips such as the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator to enhance immersive experiences.\r\n\r\nQualcomm's venture into the metaverse was due to its collaboration with Meta, demonstrating its dedication to shaping immersive digital experiences. Qualcomm's focus on generative AI through Snapdragon platforms positions it as a strong contender in the metaverse and generative AI sectors, therefore indicating its readiness to capitalize on emerging opportunities in these realms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA's expertise lies in producing powerful graphics hardware capable of handling massive calculations in parallel, making it crucial for running large-scale metaverse projects. Recently, NVIDIA unveiled the Blackwell platform, featuring chips significantly faster and more energy-efficient than the H100, promising advancements in AI performance and efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Adds privacy activist comment)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 19 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has offered to almost halve its monthly subscription fee for Facebook and Instagram to 5.99 euros from 9.99 euros, a senior Meta executive said on Tuesday, a move that aims to address concerns from privacy and antitrust regulators.\n\nThe price cut follows mounting criticism from privacy activists and consumer groups about Meta's no-ads subscription service in Europe, which critics say requires users to pay a fee to ensure their privacy.\n\nMeta launched the service in November to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which curbs its ability to personalise advertisements for users without their consent, hurting its major revenue source.\n\nThe company said the fee model seeks to balance the conflicting demands of EU privacy laws and the DMA.\n\n\"We have wanted to accelerate that process for some time because we need to get to a steady state ... so we have offered to drop the price from 9.99 to 5.99 for a single account and 4 euros for any additional accounts,\" Meta lawyer Tim Lamb told a European Commission hearing.\n\n\"That is by far the lowest end of the range that any reasonable person should be paying for services of this quality. And I think that is a serious offer. The regulatory uncertainty at the moment is out there and it needs to settle down quickly.\"\n\nAustrian privacy activist Max Schrems said the issue is not about the fee.\n\n\"We know from all research that even a fee of just 1.99 euros or less leads to a shift in consent from 3-10% that genuinely want advertisments to 99.9% that still click yes. The GDPR requires that consent must be 'freely' given,\" he said, referring to the EU privacy legislation.\n\n\"In reality it is not about the amount of money - it is about the 'pay or okay' approach as a whole. The entire purpose of 'pay or okay' is to get users to click on okay, even if this is not their free and genuine choice. We do not think the mere change of the amount makes this approach legal.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe day-long hearing aims to give Meta's users and third parties the opportunity to seek clarity on how it complies with the DMA.\n\nMeta made the reduced offer to regulators earlier this year and is now in talks with data protection authorities, specifically the Irish watchdog.\n\nUsers who consent to be tracked receive a free service funded by advertising revenues.\n\nCompanies risk fines of as much as 10% of their annual global turnover for DMA breaches.

        "title": "This Is the Cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric",
        "content": "There's been a lot of talk about the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The effort to ban TikTok faces potential 'graveyard' in Senate",
        "content": "The Senate often becomes a key stumbling block in Washington's efforts to confront Big Tech. The question now is whether that will change as the upper chamber weighs the fate of TikTok in the US.\n\nA possible ban of the popular social-media app is atop the Senate’s agenda as lawmakers return to the nation's capital this week. This comes after a 352-65 House vote to advance legislation that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the app or face that ban in the US.\n\nThe Senate in past years has served as a flashing red light to other technology reforms that found bipartisan enthusiasm in the House, including data privacy efforts and a move to prohibit tech giants from favoring their own products.\n\n\"The Senate may very well be a graveyard of this,\" said Mark MacCarthy of the Brookings Institution and Georgetown University, in an interview about whether the TikTok legislation could fit a similar pattern.\n\nThere's \"some buyer's remorse that is beginning to develop over the rapidity with which the action was taken.\" People work inside a TikTok building in Culver City, Calif. earlier this month. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe signals so far from the Senate are that it will move slowly, if at all. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has yet to tip his hand, saying only that the Senate will take a look at the legislation once it formally arrives.\n\nWhile bipartisan energy behind any effort to take on China could overwhelm efforts to slow the bill, there are also significant legal issues that senators may not be keen to overlook.\n\nFor one, the bill's decision to name TikTok specifically would almost certainly be challenged in court. There is also a broader concern that it would be challenged for taking away the First Amendment rights of American users.\n\n\"I don't see how they can change that,\" MacCarthy says of the free speech concerns. \"That's the heart of the bill.\"\n\nWashington's supposed 'cooling saucer'\n\nTech, of course, is far from the only issue where the Senate has taken on the role of tempering enthusiasm elsewhere in Washington.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt goes back to the beginning. George Washington reputedly said the Senate was created to \"cool\" House legislation like a saucer can be used to cool hot tea. To cite a more recent example, a bipartisan tax bill passed the House overwhelmingly in January of this year and is also currently languishing in the Senate.\n\nBut tech is where that pattern was particularly noticeable in recent years. Some activists charged that lawmakers in the upper chamber, and Schumer in particular, were too accommodating to the objections of CEOs.\n\nOne example came in 2022 when a bill that aimed to stop companies from favoring their own products over competitors seemed to be on the cusp of passage. After a furious lobbying effort from Big Tech CEOs, the bill never received a Senate vote as leaders like Schumer raised questions about whether it had the votes to pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, seen here in 2023, is known for communicating on a flip phone. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nAnother episode took place in 2023 when the tech topic of the day was privacy, and the Biden administration and House lawmakers were pushing for action around a bipartisan bill called the American Data Privacy Protection Act. That bill still hasn't been considered after concerns were raised in the Senate and elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to Schumer, the fate of the TikTok bill could also be in the hands of Sen. Maria Cantwell, an influential Washington state Democrat who chairs the Senate's commerce committee.\n\nShe has been only slightly more forthcoming than Schumer so far. She praised the idea of taking on the issue but didn't sound like a fan of the House approach in a statement that said in part \"I will be talking to my Senate and House colleagues to try to find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties.\"\n\nAnd TikTok itself clearly views the Senate as the key battleground, with CEO Shou Zi Chew focusing his lobbying efforts on senators. In a recent video, he urged his 170 million American users to pass along their concerns to friends and family and also \"share them with your senators.\"\n\nHe also said in the video that his company was exploring its legal options.\n\nA scrambled politics around TikTok\n\nFurther complicating the path ahead are different alliances this time around when compared to previous tech fights.\n\nSome advocates who are still pushing last year's privacy efforts — and who have been deeply critical of the Senate's role there — are opposed to taking action on TikTok.\n\nIn just one recent example, the left-leaning group More Perfect Union renewed its calls to pass a privacy bill while also arguing against a TikTok ban. It said in a video on the issue that \"the only real chance TikTok has is the Senate.\" Participants hold signs in support of TikTok outside the U.S. Capitol Building on March 13. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nAnd there is also a recent flip on the issue from former President Donald Trump.\n\nAfter years of pushing to ban TikTok, the presumptive GOP nominee for President argued against the bill in multiple recent Truth Social posts because he said getting rid of TikTok would help Mark Zuckerberg. Trump called Facebook (META) \"a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nHouse Republicans largely ignored Trump’s stance and voted for the bill by a margin of 197-15, but the former president's point about side effects of a TikTok ban is one others are raising as well.\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance Live appearance, Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill noted of TikTok \"if it was shut down, the place you're going to go is probably on YouTube and the advertisers would flip over so Google (GOOG) could be a beneficiary.\" Facebook and Pinterest (PINS) also could be helped, he added.\n\nThe House bill has also won the backing of two key senators in recent days with Senate intelligence committee chair Mark Warner and the top Republican Marco Rubio expressing their support and observers like Professor MacCarthy saying the bill still has a significant chance of passage.\n\nAt the end of the day, Washington and tech sector are waiting to see where Senate leaders end up. Schumer is currently focused on feeling out where his Democratic colleagues stand, according to MacCarthy.\n\n\"And I think it's the right job for a majority leader to be doing,\" he said.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Australian regulator demands social media firms disclose anti-terrorism efforts",
        "content": "(Adds Reddit comment in final paragraph)\n\nBy Byron Kaye\n\nSYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator has sent legal letters to social media platforms from YouTube, X and Facebook to Telegram and Reddit, demanding they hand over information about their efforts to stamp out terrorism content.\n\nThe e-Safety Commission said it was concerned the platforms were not doing enough to stop extremists from using live-streaming features, algorithms and recommendation systems to recruit users.\n\nSince 2022, the regulator has had the power to demand big tech firms give information about the prevalence of illegal content and their measures to prevent that content from spreading. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines.\n\nInman Grant said Telegram was the most used by violent extremist groups to radicalise and recruit.\n\nThe Dubai-based messaging service, which a 2022 OECD report ranked at No. 1 for frequency of what it described as terrorist and violent extremist content, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n\"We don't know if they actually have the people and resources in place to even be able to respond to these notices, but we will see,\" Commissioner Julie Inman Grant told Reuters in an interview. \"We're not going to be afraid to take it as far as we need to, to get the answers we need or to find them out of compliance and fine them.\"\n\nYouTube, ranked second for violent extremist content, \"has the power through their clever algorithms to spread propaganda broadly ... in a very overt way or a very subtle way that sends people down rabbit holes,\" she added.\n\nSubjects considered terrorism ranged from responses to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to violent conspiracy theories to \"misogynistic tropes that spill over into real-world violence against women\", Inman Grant said.\n\nThe regulator has previously sent legal letters to platforms seeking information about the handling of child abuse material and hate speech, but its anti-terrorism blitz has been the most complex because of the wide range of content and methods of amplifying content, she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nElon Musk's X was handed the first e-Safety fine in 2023 over its response to questions about its handling of child abuse content. It is challenging the $386,000 fine in the court.\n\nThe commission targeted Telegram and chat forum website Reddit for the first time in this round of legal letters which were sent on Monday. A white supremacist who killed 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York in 2022, has said the platform contributed to his radicalisation, according to the commissioner.\n\nX and YouTube owner Alphabet were not immediately available for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook owner Meta said the company was reviewing the commission's notices and that \"there is no place on our platforms for terrorism, extremism, or any promotion of violence or hate\".\n\nA Reddit spokesperson also said terrorism content had no place on the platform and \"we look forward to sharing more information on how we detect, remove, and prevent this and other forms of harmful content directly with the e-Safety Commissioner\".

        "title": "Nvidia debuts next-generation Blackwell AI chip at GTC 2024",
        "content": "On Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took the wraps off of the company’s highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nThe Blackwell is the successor to Nvidia’s already highly coveted H100 and H200 GPUs, and according to the company, it is the world’s most powerful chip. The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia’s data center revenue over the last few quarters.\n\nIn its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment’s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.\n\n“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,” Huang said in a statement.\n\n“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.”\n\nLike its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia’s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.\n\nThat setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.\n\nNvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia’s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don’t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia’s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia’s chips are especially power-hungry.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers’ concerns.\n\nNvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia’s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they’ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.\n\nBut competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren’t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his program on March 12 recalled his obsession with the stock market as a kid and how he became interested in companies and investing when he was just a fourth grader. Cramer advised his viewers to introduce their kids to investing as early as possible. Cramer said you should pick some companies that your kids are familiar with and ask them to guess which one of them would perform the best over time.\n\n“Get them started early…. The stock is a long-term contest. The earlier you get in, the more you can potentially win, over the long haul.”\n\n\"Stocks Still Represent the Greatest Opportunity\"\n\nAnswering a question in the same program, Jim Cramer advised investors not to put “too much money” in bonds because Cramer believes “stocks still represent the greatest opportunity.”\n\nIn a separate program on March 15, in which Cramer talked about his career in the Wall Street and how he witnessed some of the biggest market crashes in history, the CNBC host said when you are in your 20s you should invest in growth. Cramer said younger people should take more risk early in life because they have many years ahead of them. Cramer said he “really wants risk taking” when you are younger.\n\nCramer also advised investors not to put all their money in a stock at once. Instead, Cramer recommended that you should invest some in the start and then buy more when the stock is going down.\n\nTalking about some of the worst market crashes in US history, Cramer said:\n\n“Tough days don't last forever people but when they come along you need to know how to respond.” Jim Cramer’s Predictions Were Right About These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nWe cover Jim Cramer's stock picks and recommendations every week. But how have Cramer's stock picks been performing? Everyone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and they are going strong. But what about several others stocks Cramer recommended buying and selling over the past few months? In this article we decided to take a look at the stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy and sell in 2023 or early 2024 and saw how these companies have performed so far in 2024 based on their year-to-date stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\n9. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nIn August last year, Jim Cramer said investing in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was like “sending your money up in smoke.”\n\nIn July, Cramer said the following about Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB):\n\n“No, let’s move on from Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), let’s move on from them. They’re losing money... it’s not my cup of tea.”\n\nRocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares are down by about 22% this year through March 18.\n\nLast month the company talked about guidance and key business updates during its Q4 earnings call:\n\n\"Overall, we expect gross margin trends will continue to improve over time, thanks to the same factors that help drive improvement this year. In terms of when we can get to adjusted EBITDA breakeven Neutron investment, especially R&D spend, continues to be the pacing item to achieve its critical milestone. Turning to our recent fundraising of $355 million in convertible senior notes. With this financing, we believe we secured a large quantum of cost-effective and shareholder-friendly capital. The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program.\n\nWith that, let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the first quarter to range between $92 million and $98 million, representing sequential revenue growth of between 53% and 63%. This range reflects $60 million to $65 million of contribution from space systems and $32 million to $33 million from launch services, which assumes four launches. Although modestly lower than what we previously expected for Q4 just a few months ago. We don’t want to understate how encouraged we are with the magnitude of this forecasted quarter-on-quarter growth and how positively it reflects on the capabilities of the team to deliver this level of growth in such a complex and competitive set of businesses. We expect first quarter GAAP gross margin to range between 24% to 26% and non-GAAP gross margins to range between 29% to 31%.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nArlington, Virginia-based defense contractor AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) ranks 8th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about.  In December 2023, Jim Cramer had praised AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) quarterly results and said that AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) CEO Wahid Nawabi was doing a “terrific job.”\n\n“So I would be a buyer of the stock,” Cramer said at the time.\n\nNawabi earlier this month talked about key company updates and guidance during latest earnings call:\n\n\"With a strong third-quarter performance behind us, we’re increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We now anticipate revenue of $700 million to $710 million. Full-year net income of $51 million to $55 million or $1.86 to $2 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $122 million to $127 million. Non-GAAP earnings of $2.69 to $2.83 per diluted share. And R&D spend totaling 13% to 14% of revenue. We remain confident in our growth trajectory for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our backlog remains strong, our visibility is nearly 100%, and our pipeline continues to expand. While we await approvals on the continuing resolution in supplemental assistance package in Congress, we remain hopeful that a bipartisan agreement will be reached soon.\n\nWe stand ready with our cutting-edge battle-tested solutions and unmatched manufacturing capacity to meet our customers needs. Given our strong performance, we remain on a trajectory of our best year ever again. As stated in the past, our expectations for this year and beyond are not driven by a single product or customer, but by the overall expanding global demand and our autonomous AI-enabled unmanned solutions. We are ideally suited to continue this growth trajectory given our global installed base, battle-tested solution offering, successful track record, proven best-in-class technology, agile product development cycle, and unmatched manufacturing capacity. As our addressable markets expand, we remain well-positioned to benefit from budget priorities in the U.S. and abroad as an industry leader and the original defense technology innovator.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nAeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) stock has gained about 20% in 2024 through March 18. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nEarlier this month AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) posted Q3 results, reporting an EPS of $0.63 for the quarter, beating estimates by $0.29.\n\n7. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending investors to dump Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) for quite some time now. In December Cramer said he had decided to “pull the plug” on the stock. In August last year Cramer advised investors to sell the stock because he believed Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) was disappointing. Cramer was right, based on the stock’s performance so far this year. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 27% in 2024 through March 18.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). Jim Cramer recommends selling PLUG but he is bullish on companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n6. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about Canadian-based telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU):\n\n“I think they’re a loser, honestly. I mean, honestly. They’re just doing a terrible job. We do not need that, there’s like 40 other guys in that same space that are better.”\n\nTelus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have dipped by about 7% this year and about 17% over the past one year.\n\n5. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLithium metal batteries company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. Back in July 2023, Jim Cramer had told his viewers that there was “nothing there” for this stock and took a “hard pass” on it when asked about his take on Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Over the past one year Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) shares have lost about 25% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $23.2 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). While Cramer is bearish on QS, he recommends buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) stock is up by a considerable 38% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Meta Platforms'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n26% = US$39b ÷ US$153b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.26.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMeta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Meta Platforms has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 8.2% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Meta Platforms was able to see a decent net income growth of 9.4% over the last five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.7% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline).

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAs their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAll seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA multi-industry leader has been a popular buy for billionaire investors\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher and artificial intelligence remains the hot trade among investors. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq Composite index is up 9%, while the benchmark S&P 500 has increased by 8% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 3%. While the rally is broadening out to include retailers, industrial players, and financial services concerns, technology stocks continue to outperform, with many of the top names having gained more than 20% through 10 weeks of the year.\n\nWith AI growing at an exponential rate and demand for its products and services remains strong, tech stocks can be expected to continue outperforming in the months ahead. Here are hot stocks: the three best opportunities for investing in technology.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp by more than 80% year to date, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top-performing stock in both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices so far in 2024. This builds on the 240% gain that NVDA stock achieved in 2023. If there’s one hot technology stock for investors to own now, it would be this microchip company. With a market capitalization of $2.20 trillion, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIncreasingly, NVDA stock exerts an outsized influence over the entire market. When the stock dips, the market does too. When Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the market rallies in support. As the leading producer of chips and semiconductors that power AI applications, Nvidia’s demand for its products and expectations for its share price remain sky-high. Analysts currently rate NVDA stock a “strong buy.” There are no sell ratings on the shares.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second best-performing tech stock of the year, and fourth among S&P 500 companies, is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ:META). So far in 2024, META stock has gained 40%. Over the last 12 months, the shares are up nearly 150%. Meta Platforms’ stock really took off after the company announced strong quarterly financial results and its first-ever dividend payment in early February.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Meta will pay its shareholders a dividend of 50 cents a share beginning on March 26 of this year. The company also announced an expanded $50 billion share repurchase program. While the rewards for stockholders are nice and the earnings have been impressive, Meta is also seen as a leader in AI and is gobbling up microchips from Nvidia at a fast pace to fuel its growing ambitions in the space.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another top-performing stock. NFLX stock is up more than 30% this year and has doubled in the last 12 months. This after the company overhauled its business model, adding paid advertisements to its platform for the first time, cracking down on password sharing, and moving into sports programming.\n\nThe end result has been that Netflix added 13.1 million net new subscribers in the final quarter of 2023, crushing forecasts that called for a maximum of nine million additions. Netflix is also one of the only streaming services that is turning a profit and is quickly separating itself from the pack in terms of content and subscriber growth. The strike last year by Hollywood writers and actors appears to have only been a speed bump for Netflix.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

        "content": "Nvidia captured the market's spotlight in 2023 and so far in 2024. But Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is just as good -- if not a better story.\n\nIn less than 1 1/2 years -- between Nov. 2, 2022 and March 8, 2024, Meta went up a staggering 458.8%. The stock went from an eight-year low to an all-time high in a relatively short period. A lot of it was due to Meta being oversold in 2022, but the bigger story is that Meta has one of the best business models in the world.\n\nHere's the metric that shows why Meta Platforms is the most innovative \"Magnificent Seven\" company and why it could be worth buying, even though the stock price is the highest it's ever been. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvesting in product improvements\n\nOn an absolute basis, Meta Platforms spends the second-most money on research and development (R&D) behind only Alphabet. But as a percentage of revenue, no Magnificent Seven company comes even close to Meta, which has an R&D-to-revenue ratio of 28.5%. META R&D to Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPart of the reason Alphabet and Meta have such high R&D expenses is the nature of their businesses. The two largest companies in the communications sector profit from their platforms. For Alphabet, it's mainly Google, Google Cloud, and YouTube. For Meta, it's driven by Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nThese platforms are cash cows but take fine-tuning. And in Meta's case, Instagram required a major overhaul to combat TikTok. The threat of TikTok was largely responsible for Meta's sell-off in 2022, compounded by a broader tech sell-off and disgruntled shareholders who were tired of the company spending money on the metaverse and its unprofitable Reality Labs segment.\n\nHowever, Instagram's improvement has worked wonders for the company. Meta estimated it has over 3.1 billion people who use at least one of its apps every day. The company leverages artificial intelligence (AI) through its apps, and AI was a big part of making Meta's answer to TikTok -- reels -- a resounding success.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has a wide moat\n\nIf you listened to Meta's Q4 2023 earnings call, you probably heard the company talk at length that it has been investing in AI and the metaverse for some time and continues to do so. But now it operates a lean business and plans to keep it that way.\n\nHow can Meta invest so aggressively in growth while also staying lean? Simply put, it's because it doesn't need to spend a lot of money relative to what its platforms provide.\n\nApple has to make and sell new phones and physical products. Tesla has to sell cars. Nvidia has to sell GPUs. Amazon has to sell subscriptions, products through its e-commerce platform, and book clients through Amazon Web Services Microsoft has to sell software subscriptions, physical products, and manage Microsoft Azure clients.\n\nAlphabet has the closest business model to Meta Platforms of the Magnificent Seven companies. It has built a wide moat in search, but its platforms are more vulnerable to disruption than Meta's.\n\nPurely from a business model standpoint, there is arguably no better cash cow than Meta. Its digital real estate has become one of the most valuable touchpoints for advertisers to interact directly with consumers based on their preferences.\n\nMeta has physical products, too, like the Meta Quest virtual-reality headset. Its business isn't reliant on the performance of these products, so they act as a cherry on top of the investment thesis rather than a make-or-break factor.\n\nMeta's ability to address the threat of TikTok in a relatively short period is largely due to its cash-cow business model and strong balance sheet. But cash would mean nothing if Meta didn't use it effectively. The company proved it can effectively innovate, pivot, accept its mistakes, and improve.\n\nCompetition has a way of bringing out the best in even great companies. And although it was painful for Meta at that moment, TikTok arguably made Instagram even more valuable to long-term investors.\n\nRewarding shareholders\n\nMeta has enough money to fund its operations, R&D, organic growth, and return money to shareholders and recently announced its first-ever dividend. It has reduced its outstanding share count by over 10% in the last three years and authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases. (For context, Meta spent $20 billion on share buybacks in 2023.) It can fully fund future buybacks and the dividend with free cash flow (FCF), considering it earned a staggering $43.9 billion in 2023. META Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nMeta's price-to-earnings ratio of 34 and price-to-FCF ratio of 30.3 aren't nearly as cheap as they used to be. But it's still not a bad deal for a fast-growing company. Given Meta's rally, you'd think the stock would be far more expensive, but its current valuation shows just how beaten down it was in late 2022.\n\nA balanced buy\n\nMeta can support an expensive R&D program, which can help improve its platforms in the face of stiff competition. It can fuel growth with cash and support a sizable capital-return program.\n\nThe company has blossomed into a balanced tech play, its platforms proving stickier than ever. The stock isn't a steal at these levels, but there's no denying the business is at the top of its game.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Another \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powerhouse Is Cheaper",
        "content": "When you think about buying an artificial intelligence (AI) stock today, one of the first names to come to mind is probably Nvidia. And for good reason. Nvidia is the leading seller of AI chips, with more than 80% market share, and this has driven record earnings and tremendous share performance in recent times.\n\nNvidia is also one of the industry-leading stocks dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a reference to the 1960 film. These stocks have led the market's gains over the past year thanks to their growth and focus on the hot area of AI. But Nvidia isn't the only game in town for investors who want to get in on the AI boom. In fact, another member of the Magnificent Seven is cheaper than Nvidia and is on track to become an AI powerhouse.\n\nAnd this means you may want to hold off on buying Nvidia right now and instead get in on this more compelling Magnificent Seven buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA social media empire\n\nSo what stock am I talking about? A company that's built a social media empire and in recent times has poured investment into AI -- which it aims to use across its products and services. I'm talking about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nYou probably know Meta well thanks to its suite of leading social media apps, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company makes most of its revenue through advertising across these platforms -- they're such popular apps that advertisers flock to them to reach us, their potential customers.\n\nThis has helped Meta grow its earnings into the billions of dollars over the past several years. META Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nAnd it's likely Meta will continue with this dominance for two reasons. First, its broad range of social media apps helps this company appeal to a variety of age groups and interests. Second, switching to a different social media platform takes a decent amount of time and effort -- and Meta's platforms are widely used around the world. These points keep users coming back.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is great because we can count on this revenue driver supporting Meta's big AI initiative, one the company is making a priority. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says this year AI will be the company's \"biggest investment area,\" from engineering to compute resources.\n\nBy the end of this year, Meta aims to have 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) on board to power its AI programs. One of Meta's big projects so far has been developing its Llama large language model (LLM) and right now Llama 3 is in the training stage. The company is focused on an open-source process, which allows anyone to access general infrastructure such as the Llama models.\n\nA winning bet for Meta\n\nThis could be a winning bet for Meta because open-sourcing results in greater use of the particular tool, such as Llama, and community feedback -- and that helps make the platform more secure, could lead to it becoming an industry standard, and may drive top talent to Meta.\n\nMeta has already rolled out various AI tools across its social media platforms, for example AI stickers and virtual assistant Meta AI, both powered by technology from Llama 2. In the future, Zuckerberg says his goal is for every Meta user to have access to AI tools that suit their needs -- from the AI assistant to AI tools that help businesses better serve customers.\n\nThese features should encourage Meta users to spend more time on the apps, and this in turn makes these apps the perfect destination for advertisers. So, Meta's investment in AI now should drive revenue growth down the road.\n\nAll of this could also transform Meta into an AI industry leader, opening the door to new revenue opportunities.\n\nNow let's consider Meta's valuation. You have to pay surprisingly little to get in on this stock with a solid growth track record and promising AI prospects -- it's trading for only 25 times forward earnings estimates. That's compared to 37 times for Nvidia.\n\nOf course, these companies work differently within the world of AI. Nvidia sells AI chips and other products and services to develop AI platforms -- Meta actually is an Nvidia customer, buying GPUs from this market leader. But both of these Magnificent Seven companies are benefiting and could continue to thrive in the AI space. And right now, thanks to its investment in AI and bargain valuation, Meta makes the best stock to scoop up without hesitation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "American workers are becoming more productive.\n\nRecent analysis from Bank of America showed the average revenue per worker for companies in the S&P 500 hit an all-time high in Februaryafter 15 years of no gains. This is one of several signs that labor productivity is rebounding after slumping during 2022.\n\nSome on Wall Street think the developments in labor productivity could help the stock market survive stickier-than-expected inflation that has emerged as a concern in recent weeks.\n\n\"If productivity goes higher, then [companies] are able to cut costs, improve margins, things like that,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance. \"That's why companies are so focused on improving productivity. There's a lot of macro headwinds happening. So they are trying to find ways to improve productivity and sort of offset those headwinds.\"\n\nThe headwinds Kwon references include the risk the Federal Reserve holds off on cutting interest rates as inflation's path downward continues to prove bumpier than initially hoped.Two separate reports released this week showed inflation was hotter than economists expected in February. And annual wage growth during the month was higher than what economists have said the Fed wants to see to feel confident inflation is moving down to its 2% target.\n\nThe research team at Carson Group argues an increase in productivity could offset these concerns, though.\n\n\"With productivity soaring like it is and will hopefully continue like it can, you don't have to worry about inflation coming back, you really don't,\" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance.\n\nDetrick's colleague Sonu Varghese explained that persistent wage growth can usually cause an inflation problem if consumers have more money to spend on goods. Demand for goods would rise as workers make more money, therefore pushing prices higher. This paradigm shifts, though, if productivity picks up. In that instance, the economy could sustain higher wages because companies would also be producing more goods. If both the demand and supply of goods pick up, then prices can remain stable.\n\nStory continues\n\nVarghese highlighted two different instances where wage growth surged. In the 1970s, wage growth picked up but productivity didn't, leading to a decade-long battle with persistent inflation. In the 1990s, wage growth gains were met with a productivity boom and subsequently led to a prosperous stretch for both US economic growth and stock market gains.\n\nAs productivity picks up, it increases the overall trajectory of the US economic growth, Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat's welcome news for stocks.\n\nCompanies can choose to use their increased financial gains from productivity in a variety of ways. One would be to keep boosting wages to lure in more workers. But recent shifts in the labor market show that likely won't be the case.\n\nThe labor market has shown some signs of softening and the large pay bumps needed to lure workers in the post-lockdown job market have eased. The quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, hit its lowest level since August 2020 in January.\n\nThis would indicate that companies would take their additional revenues from increased productivity and use them to boost margins. Higher margins are usually a tailwind for future company earnings, which would in theory lift equities.\n\nAll of this comes without a mention of artificial intelligence, which has been lauded as a potential productivity booster.\n\n\"AI is kind of like the cherry on the top,\" Kwon said. \"AI obviously is going to be a huge productivity enhancer. I don't know when that's going to happen. But we do think that is going to happen and be a huge boost to productivity as well.\" Denver Broncos mascot Thunder, ridden by Ann Judge, crosses the field with the American flag after a touchdown in the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Empower Field at Mile High.

        "title": "This week in Bidenomics: The TikTok head fake",
        "content": "If you want to see Joe Biden having fun, check out his presidential campaign’s TikTok account.\n\nThe account’s avatar is “Dark Brandon,” Biden as a superhero mockup with laser-beam eyes. In short videos, Biden and his surrogates troll Donald Trump using images that make the former president look overweight, sweaty, and pallid. Other clips show Biden in heartwarming encounters with ordinary people that aren’t testy enough to make it onto cable news.\n\nBiden is clearly trying to connect with young Americans who constitute a big chunk of TikTok’s 170 million American users. Yet he also said recently he'd sign a bill working its way through Congress that would ban TikTok in the United States if its Chinese owners don’t sell to a non-Chinese entity. So what’s going on?\n\nIt would be thoroughly self-damaging for Biden if he were the man to sign the bill that put TikTok out of commission. He could easily alienate enough people, including millions of small-business operators who rely on TikTok, to give his opponent Donald Trump the edge in the 2024 presidential election. Biden is courting every tiny voting bloc that might break his way, so would he really commit political suicide by enraging millions of voters in one fell swoop?\n\nThe answer is obviously no, which suggests Biden knows something he’s not saying: that TikTok will be alive and well come Election Day and probably long after that.\n\nBiden is serious about the underlying problems unique to TikTok, which mainly have to do with a Chinese company’s ownership of the app and the potential for Chinese hacking, propaganda, or abuse. But electoral politics and legal realities will save Biden from being the TikTok killer, at least in 2024.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThe bill to force TikTok to divest or face a ban passed the House of Representatives by a comfortable margin on March 13, which seemed to catch the company’s leaders off guard. In the normally fractured and dysfunctional House, Republicans and Democrats joined forces to put TikTok on notice that Washington can act quickly when it comes to concerns about China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the path is hazier in the Senate, which normally moves slowly and has other pressing business in the queue ahead of TikTok. The Senate also tends to back away from touchy issues during election years, which Biden surely knows. It seems safe to assume Biden is working closely with his fellow Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to maximize Democrats’ odds of holding on to power in the 2024 elections. Sending Biden a bill to ban TikTok would do the opposite.\n\nPoliticians often say they favor bold action when they know they’ll never actually have to take it. This is probably one of those times. Biden surely knows what Schumer plans and is probably even conspiring with him on the shrewdest way forward. These powerful Democrats could surely miscalculate, but barring that, TikTok isn’t going to be Joe Biden’s undoing in 2024. The Senate will almost certainly delay moving on the TikTok bill until after the election. President Biden's TikTok page (TikTok/Screenshot: Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe concerns about TikTok, however, seem plausible. Chinese company ByteDance owns TikTok, and while ByteDance is a private sector company by Chinese standards, it’s also bound by the rules set by China’s Communist Party (CCP), which can put private companies to the party’s use as it chooses. Many policymakers in Washington, of both parties, think the CCP could coerce ByteDance to exploit its presence on millions of American phones to conduct surveillance of key Americans, promote election propaganda, or cause other forms of trouble.\n\nTikTok hasn’t helped itself, as Kevin Roose pointed out recently in the New York Times. Trump first tried to ban TikTok by executive order in 2020, but courts blocked the effort. Since then, TikTok’s stumbling make-nice campaign has been a mixture of belligerence and manipulation. It has accused critics of bigotry, as if the risk of China’s Communist leaders meddling in Western affairs is a racist myth, which it is not. It amped up its Washington, D.C., lobbying operations à la Facebook, except that Facebook is an American company with no vulnerability to the CCP, at least not in the United States. Most clumsily, TikTok got caught obtaining the user data of two US journalists and other American users in 2022, which sounds exactly like something a Chinese surveillance operation would do.\n\nChina has few friends left in Washington, with the two political parties now competing for which can be “toughest” on China. Biden’s approach has been a series of legislative and executive actions to deepen domestic supply chains, reduce dependency on China, and block China’s acquisition of advanced Western technology that could be used for weapons or national security. A TikTok divestiture movement fits more or less within those boundaries.\n\nIf 2024 is the year of the warning shot for TikTok, 2025 could be the year of the full broadside — but only if Biden wins in November. A second-term Biden who wouldn’t have to worry about reelection would have more freedom to press Congress to pass the divestiture-or-ban law, sign it, then play hardball in terms of enforcement. TikTok seems sure to challenge any such law, so it could be tied up in court for years if it ever does pass. But parent ByteDance could also become more amenable to a sale — which it expressly rejects now — if a ban is hanging over its head.\n\nIf Trump wins in November, TikTok may have less to worry about. Though Trump once favored a ban, he seems to have changed his mind, arguing recently that banning TikTok would only make his archenemy Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook stronger. Trump also seems to be getting cozy with billionaire investor Jeff Yass, who owns a stake in ByteDance worth at least $15 billion. Yass has become a Republican mega-donor and a rumored candidate to be the next Treasury secretary if Trump wins.\n\nTrump's flip-flop sounds like a good topic for a cheeky Biden TikTok video.\n\nEditor's note: There will no weekly Bidenomics on March 22. It will resume March 29.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Forget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 7’ European Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at some European stocks liked by Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Likes These Super 3 European Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in one of his latest programs on CNBC that the US stock market isn’t the only one with the “breadth” problem, referring to the phenomenon where most of the stock market gains last year came from a handful of mega-cap tech stocks or Magnificent Seven stocks which include companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cramer said that the concentration of stock market gains is much higher in the European stock market. Cramer shared some data to back this point which was published by Citi’s equity research team led by Dr. Beata Manthey. He said that in January and February this year, just five stocks in Europe accounted for about 45% of the total gains of MSCI Europe Index.\n\nJim Cramer Shares a New \"Shopping List\" of Stocks for 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that analysts at Citi recently ran a screen for mega-cap European stocks with characteristics similar to Magnificent Seven stocks in the US: high earnings growth, solid margins and strong economic moat. Cramer said Citi analysts believe these stocks have lower valuations when compared to their US counterparts and have more room to run in the future. As you will see later in this article, Cramer also believes several of these seven stocks in Europe have a lot of growth potential.\n\nJim Cramer said that Citi’s Super Seven list “makes for a great list of companies.”\n\nHowever, Jim Cramer did emphasize that he cannot recommend investors to start piling into these stocks immediately since most of them are trading at their all-time highs. Cramer said that it would make him look a “little crazy” to recommend stocks that already had a “huge run.” But Jim Cramer urged his viewers to see these companies as a “shopping list” of high quality stocks that “could be very attractive” on pullback.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Likes These Super 7 European Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent program on CNBC in which he walked his viewers through Citi's Dr. Beata Manthey's Super Seven European stocks and shared his bullish thoughts on these companies. Cramer thinks these stocks should be bought on a pullback.\n\n7. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJim Cramer recently quoted Citi and said the “leader” of the Super Seven group of stocks is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Cramer said it’s “obvious” that the pharmaceutical company is the leader of the group. Cramer said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) was the company which originally came up with GLP-1 drugs for diabetes. He said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is “years ahead” of his American favorite weight loss stock Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer said that recently it was revealed that the GLP-1 pill Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is developing could be much more effective than the one being developed by Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer also highlighted the FDA’s recent approval for Novo Nordisk's (NYSE:NVO) drug for heart disease. Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) said the FDA approved its weight-loss drug Wegovy for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight or obese people with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nCramer said that it “can’t go wrong with either of these stocks” as he believes more Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has more room for growth.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“As we discussed in last quarter’s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.”\n\n6. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the European stocks in the Super Seven group recommended by Citi and liked by Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer said ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is operating in the semiconductor equipment sector where there’s limited competition and ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) remains “unrivaled.” Cramer said that ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) has a “monopoly” in making equipment that is required to make advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) excellent stock performance, since the stock is up 58% over the past one year and 33% in 2024 through March 14. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) stock has been roaring after ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) posted a blockbuster quarterly report in January. Cramer seemed especially excited about ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) net bookings which came in at a whopping  €9.2 billion, compared to the Street’s estimate of just €3.57 billion.\n\nIn addition to ASML, Jim Cramer likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\n5. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY)\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is another important member of the Super Seven group of European stocks. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is very “exciting” for “a lot of people out there.” Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. Cramer named some of the top brands of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) which include Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Givenchy, Dior, Fendi, among many others.\n\nJim Cramer said that one of the strengths of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is its target market — the rich. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) posted a “blowout” quarter in January and the stock has been a “phenomenal” performer. He believes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) stock can “keep winning” but recommended investors to wait for a pullback to buy it.\n\nHere is what  Distillate Capital has to say about LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“After rebalancing, Distillate’s International FSV strategy offers a higher free cash flow yield both to market cap and enterprise value, and has substantially more stable fundamentals and less leverage than the index. The largest new position is LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY), where estimated free cash ϲows are up year-to-date while the stock is down.”\n\n4. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNext on the list of the Super Seven group of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), the Germany-based software company. Cramer said SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) “took its time” to adjust to the “new world” of Cloud computing but eventually caught up and now it’s making “big money” off of artificial intelligence. Jim Cramer praised the stock’s run over the past several months (it’s up about 64% over the past one year) and said it’s “probably not done.” Cramer also said that he “should have caught it” but he was focusing more on ServiceNow. Cramer is also bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The biggest stakeholder of SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) during this period was Ken Fisher which had an $820 million stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Like Workday and Amazon, SAP SE’s (NYSE:SAP) stock price rose significantly in Q4 after the company reported its Q3 2023 earnings. Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both robust cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive.\n\nWe also view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of its customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back.”\n\nTo see rest of the stocks in this list click Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 3’ European Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Meta Platforms (META) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in META?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $19.94.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For more than a year, Wall Street has been putting smiles on most investors' faces. Following bear market declines in 2022 for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite, all three major stock indexes have powered their way to record-closing highs in 2024.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of factors that have fed the current bull market, such as a lower inflation rate and the continued strength of the U.S. economy, much of the heavy lifting has fallen on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's most influential businesses\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most prominent businesses on the planet in terms of both aggregate sales and innovation. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from handily outperforming all three major stock indexes over long periods, the Magnificent Seven offer sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is the dominant provider of desktop operating systems (Windows) and has seen its share of global cloud infrastructure service spend jump to 25%, thanks to Azure. Apple's iPhone has accounted for around half or more of the U.S. smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable. The company has also bought back a jaw-dropping $651 billion of its own stock in 11 years. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a virtual monopoly (90%-plus share) of GPUs in use in high-compute data centers this year. Amazon leads in two categories. It's the far-and-away biggest player in e-commerce and held a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend via Amazon Web Services (AWS), as of September 2023. Alphabet's Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search, with close to 92% of worldwide share in February. Alphabet also owns the second-most-visited social site (YouTube) and the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms is the owner of Facebook, the most visited social site in the world. Collectively, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and other apps, Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users to its social media \"real estate.\" Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nWhile all seven of these components have been phenomenal long-term investments, their outlooks going forward could differ greatly -- and that all starts with their valuations.\n\nRanking the Magnificent Seven stocks from cheapest to priciest using a common valuation tool\n\nTo be upfront, analyzing the valuations of public companies can be subjective. What one investor believes is pricey, another might view as an incredible deal. Likewise, fundamental metrics are fluid and constantly changing as companies report their operating results and Wall Street analysts react to this data.\n\nNevertheless, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has stood the test of time as the most rudimentary measure of value for public companies. But since Wall Street is forward-looking, utilizing the forward P/E ratio, which takes into account consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the upcoming year, makes the most sense.\n\nBased on consensus estimates from Wall Street, as of the closing bell on March 13, here's how the Magnificent Seven ranked from cheapest to priciest using this common valuation tool:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 17.83 forward P/E ratio Meta Platforms: 21.56 Apple: 23.9 Nvidia: 30.43 Microsoft: 31.07 Amazon: 33.95 Tesla: 41.14\n\nTo offer some context, the forward P/E ratios for the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq 100 are 21.1 and 31.32, respectively.\n\nBased purely on earnings potential for the coming year, Amazon and Tesla appear relatively pricey, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms look like bargains. The latter is particularly interesting, given that Meta has more than quintupled since its 2022 bear market bottom yet remains attractively valued, based on consensus EPS estimates for the company.\n\nHowever, the forward P/E ratio doesn't provide the most complete story in terms of valuation. While it can be a helpful tool for assessing mature businesses, an even better measure of value exists for the generally faster-growing and innovation-driven Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the smartest way to rank the Magnificent Seven from cheapest to most expensive\n\nIn addition to being dominant within their respective industries, the Magnificent Seven share another trait: They tend to reinvest a sizable percentage of their operating cash flow back into their respective businesses. In other words, they're willing to forgo maximum profits in the short term to invest in higher-growth initiatives that could really fuel their growth rates years down the road.\n\nRather than relying on the forward P/E ratio, analyzing the multiple that each company trades at relative to its forward-year consensus cash flow is a considerably smarter way to value these dominant businesses.\n\nHere's how the Magnificent Seven stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive when examined relative to next year's cash flow:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 12.53 times next year's cash consensus cash flow Amazon: 12.8 Meta Platforms: 13.19 Apple: 21.1 Microsoft: 24.15 Tesla: 27.38 Nvidia: 30.59\n\nOn one hand, Microsoft, Tesla, and especially Nvidia are making it tougher for growth seekers to find value. Tesla's operating margin is falling as it slashes prices on its production models in order to keep inventory levels under control. Meanwhile, Nvidia is set to face a laundry list of headwinds -- including AI GPU competition from many of its top customers (which are Magnificent Seven components).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Amazon is historically inexpensive, relative to its future cash flow. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of net sales, Amazon could see its cash-flow growth handily outpace its annual sales growth. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms confirms that it's still a potential bargain at just 13 times forward-year cash flow.\n\nBut the best deal within the Magnificent Seven is Alphabet, which also happens to be the cheapest constituent when using the forward P/E ratio.\n\nAlphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be Google. With a nearly 92% share of worldwide internet search, Google is the logical go-to for advertisers looking to target their message(s) to specific consumers. More often than not, this will give Google exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet's advertising segments benefiting from long-winded economic expansions, Google Cloud looks like a force to be reckoned with. After years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered its first operating profit in 2023.\n\nCloud service margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and enterprise cloud spending is likely in its early innings. In short, this segment may be Alphabet's prime source of cash-flow growth throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal among the Magnificent Seven stocks, the data suggests you can't go wrong with Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Stock buybacks, or share repurchase programs, are commonly executed by companies to boost shareholder value.\n\nA stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves.\n\nIn 2024, several companies – HCA Healthcare HCA, Meta Platforms META, and eBay EBAY – have unveiled repurchase programs. In addition to buybacks, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting positive earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nHCA Healthcare\n\nHCA Healthcare, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. The company authorized an additional $3 billion share repurchase program following its latest quarterly print.\n\nAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s outlook was boosted following better-than-expected quarterly results. HCA posted a 16.8% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 4.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting year-over-year growth rates of 27% and 12%, respectively.\n\nHCA’s growth has remained strong as of late, with revenue seeing a recent acceleration. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nHolding a spot in the elite Magnificent 7 group, Meta shares have been remarkably strong performers over the last year, up 150%.\n\nMeta authorized an additional $50 billion in share buybacks and unveiled its first-ever dividend following its latest set of quarterly results, helping to explain the strong reaction post-earnings. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations jumping higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the company’s advertising revenue has positively surprised in six consecutive quarters, with the most recent beat totaling 2.2% (or $827 million). Advertising represents the bulk of the company’s revenue, making up 96.5% of overall sales in Q4.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\neBay\n\neBay unveiled an additional $2 billion share buyback following its latest set of quarterly results. Concerning headline figures, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by 4% and reported sales 2.3% ahead of expectations.\n\nShares popped following the release, reflecting investors’ bullish stance. Positive earnings estimate revisions soon followed, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s shareholder-friendly nature shouldn’t be overlooked, reflected by its 15.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares currently yield 2.1% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 32% of the company’s earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nA common way that companies amplify shareholder value is through implementing share buybacks. They can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, indicating that the company is utilizing excess cash and can help put in a floor for shares.\n\nAnd recently, all companies above – HCA Healthcare HCA, Meta Platforms META, and eBay EBAY  – unveiled additional or fresh buyback programs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Column: What would banning TikTok accomplish? Answer: Virtually nothing",
        "content": "In January, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified along with other social media CEOs at a Senate hearing about their platforms' effect on children. (Senate Judiciary Committee)\n\nIn just the last few days, a couple of developments involving TikTok have arisen to illustrate the right and wrong way to think about the rapidly expanding social media platform.\n\nThe first was a devastating exposé that independent journalist Jonathan M. Katz posted there of a misleading story Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told during her official GOP response to President Biden's State of the Union address.\n\nIn his Tiktok on March 8, the day after the speech, Katz expertly demolished Britt's claim to have interviewed an immigrant who told of having been sold out as a sex slave and Britt's attempt to tie the story to Biden's immigration policy — never mind that the subject's travails took place 20 years ago, in Mexico, and had nothing to do with immigration policy.\n\nIt’s a great business and I’m going to put together a group to buy TikTok.\n\nEx-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\n\nIn doing do, Katz also exposed the laziness of our own political press corps, which had to scurry to follow his lead. This was social media at their best — concise, visual and effective.\n\nThe second occurrence was the House vote Wednesday to effectively ban TikTok. The measure, which passed by a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 352-65, requires TikTok's Beijing-based owner, ByteDance, to divest the platform's U.S. operations within six months or face a nationwide ban.\n\nThe rationales put forth for the ban are varied and almost uniformly questionable. Its advocates cite the threat of Chinese government breaches of users' privacy, its potential use as a conduit of Chinese anti-democratic propaganda into the U.S., its purportedly deleterious effect on its youthful users — one critic likened it to \"opium.\"\n\nThe campaign to ban TikTok deserves close scrutiny, covering such issues as who's really behind it and why this platform is taking more heat from lawmakers than all other social media platforms put together.\n\nThe House's headlong plunge into TikTok-banning smacks of what the fictional panjandrums of \"Yes Minister\" labeled \"politicians' logic\": \"Something must be done; this is something; therefore, we must do it.\" The thing that something must be done about is clipping the wings of the Beijing regime.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether targeting TikTok will advance that purpose is doubtful in the extreme. As Sir Arnold Robinson and Sir Humphrey Appleby of that classic British political farce understood, this is all about theater.\n\nLet's start with the huge majority of the House vote, which brought 197 Republicans together with 155 Democrats in favor. The \"no\" vote, however, was also bipartisan, with 50 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposed.\n\nRead more:Column: Meta and Twitter show the drawbacks of giving self-satisfied billionaires too much power\n\nCapitol Hill observers chuckled over how the issue brought together the strangest of strange bedfellows, with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) voting on the same side (the \"no\" side) possibly for the first and last time from now to the end of recorded time. The ban's prospects in the Senate are uncertain, though President Biden has said he'd sign it if it passed.\n\nDonald Trump, who used to advocate a ban and even tried to implement a ban while he was president, more recently reversed himself, notably after a meeting with GOP megadonor Jeff Yass, who owns 15% of ByteDance. That stake is worth about $40 billion, based on the parent company's putative value of $268 billion as of year-end 2023. (Trump said the subject of TikTok didn't come up during their encounter.)\n\nInterestingly, a figure who slithered out of the woodwork as a potential buyer of TikTok if ByteDance does divest is Steven T. Mnuchin, who was Trump's Treasury secretary. He posed less as a savior of TikTok's users from the sinister designs of Chinese overlords than an investor spotting the main chance on the horizon. More on him in a moment.\n\nFirst, let's turn to who's pulling the strings on a TikTok ban. One evident culprit is Meta, which owns the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta paid for an extensive publicity campaign aimed at eroding TikTok's public reputation by playing up its supposed threats to the health and welfare of young users, the Washington Post reported in 2022.\n\nMeta's concern isn't hard to understand: TikTok has become more popular than any of its platforms. Social media marketing surveys indicate that the average monthly time spent on Facebook this year has been around 15.4 hours; on Instagram it's 16.5 hours and on WhatsApp it's 16.75 hours. On TikTok, it's 27.9 hours.\n\nEven worse from Meta's standpoint, TikTok's user base has been skewing younger than Instagram's, its most direct competitor, and much younger than Facebook, which has been trending toward older users.\n\nAs for the suggestions that TikTok is somehow uniquely injurious to youthful users, represents a unique threat to users' privacy, or presents a national security issue, one can only think this is some sort of a gag.\n\nRead more:Column: Is this the beginning of Facebook's downfall?\n\nThe worst serial violator of users' privacy is arguably Meta. The company drew a record $5-billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, when it was known as Facebook. That fine arose from Facebook's violations of a settlement the company had reached with the government in 2012 over its previous privacy violations, as well as a habit of deceiving users into thinking their privacy was secure.\n\nThe FTC isn't done with Meta yet; as recently as Tuesday, the agency obtained a ruling from a federal appeals court allowing it to continue investigating the company's privacy practices, including allegations that it deceives parents about policies designed to protect children from online contacts with potential abusers.\n\nSpreading anti-democratic propaganda? Facebook's connections with the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which facilitated the spread of political propaganda in the presidential election and Brexit vote in 2016, have been thoroughly documented. (That's not to excuse the Chinese regime's appetite for censorship, or its mistreatment of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs.)\n\nAnyone inclined to wring their hands over TikTok's role in sullying public discourse and internet safety in this country must acknowledge the role of all the leading social media platforms — not only Meta but X and YouTube.\n\nAll have fallen down on the job of policing disinformation, racism, antisemitism and other forms of hate speech on their sites. X bathes in all this as examples of \"free speech,\" as the platform's owner, Elon Musk, brags. All have undertaken layoffs that eviscerated their \"trust and safety\" teams, allowing untrustworthy and dangerous content to inundate their users.\n\nThat brings us to Mnuchin. He surfaced Thursday on CNBC and the financial press with an announcement that he was putting together an investment consortium to take TikTok off ByteDance's hands, if the divestment becomes mandated. \"It’s a great business and I’m going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\" he said.\n\nWould that make TikTok any safer for its users or democracy? Why would anyone think so? The last takeover of a social media company by a prominent individual was Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now renamed X. From the standpoint of users or anyone interested in a civil, reliable, safe public space, that deal has been disastrous. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter has become a sub-functional hellscape of filth that has evolved into a megaphone for its owner to pump conspiracy theories and hate speech out onto the internet.\n\nBut the ban-TikTok campaign really isn't about any of that. As Jason Koebler of 404Media observes, a TikTok ban would \"have the effect of further entrenching and empowering gigantic, monopolistic American social media companies that have nearly all of the same problems that TikTok does.\"\n\nHe's right. At its heart, TikTok today is no different from the other platforms, and it won't become different no matter who owns it. All of them share the same business model, which is to deceive their users into thinking they're getting a valuable service for free, when in fact the users are simply raw material to be sold to advertisers and political manipulators, en masse.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

        "content": "Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is putting together a group of investors seeking to purchase TikTok if the social media app's parent company ByteDance is forced to sell it off. Mnuchin made the announcement during an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday.\n\n\"I understand the technology, it's a great business, and I'm going to put together a group to buy TikTok,\" he said.\n\nWhile Mnuchin wouldn't name who he's working with to potentially buy the platform, he did say that it involves a combination of different investors outside of Big Tech firms.\n\n\"I don't think this should be controlled by any of the big US tech companies,\" he said. \"I think there could be antitrust issues on that, and it should be something that is independent so that we have a real competitor. And users love it, so it shouldn't be shut down.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the House voted overwhelmingly to force ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok. If the company doesn't sell the app, app stores like Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store would be required to stop hosting the platform or face fines of as much as $5,000 per app user.\n\nThe Senate would need to pass a similar bill.\n\nRead more:Why a possible TikTok ban could face an uphill climb after passing House\n\nMnuchin, who chaired the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under former President Trump, said the data the app collects, and the fact that it's owned by a Chinese company, are especially problematic. Devotees of TikTok gather at the Capitol in Washington as the House passes a bill that would lead to a nationwide ban of the popular video app if its China-based owner doesn't sell, Wednesday, March 13, 2024. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"This shouldn't be controlled by the Chinese. It is an issue for this to be on everybody's phone,\" he said. \"When you have this app on everybody's phone it has the ability to collect an awful lot of data. It should be owned by US businesses. There's no way that the Chinese would ever let a US company own something like this in China.\"\n\nMnuchin's task won't be easy. During the interview he admitted that the app would need to be rebuilt in the US using US technology. But TikTok's secret sauce is the algorithm that keeps users scrolling through while waiting for class to start and through their lunch breaks.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nWashington, as well as states and municipalities across the country, has been working to kill TikTok for years on fears that the data TikTok collects can be used to manipulate users or gather information about them that amounts to a national security threat.\n\nBut, so far, no government agency has managed to provide a succinct explanation as to what that threat entails. Free speech advocates, meanwhile, have come forward saying that killing TikTok would violate Americans' First Amendment rights. As a result, the legislation is all but guaranteed to face legal challenges if it does pass the Senate and is signed by President Biden.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "12 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best Guru stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.\n\nAccording to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.\n\nIn this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered out the 12 best stocks out of The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU)’s portfolio of 61 holdings as of March 11 based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

The healthcare, communication services, and consumer staples sectors were the weakest. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) produces oil and natural gas in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Its shares rallied along with oil prices, a key driver of revenue and earnings.”\n\n11. S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nGuru’s Stake as of March 11: $689,088\n\nS&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is placed among the best Guru stocks.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) increased due to higher debt issuance amid more favorable market conditions. Billed issuance rose 47% in October and 26% in November against subdued levels last year, with issuance boosted by declining interest rates and tighter bond spreads. Positive equity market performance in the fourth quarter benefited asset-based fees. In addition, the company reported strong quarterly financial results with double-digit growth in revenue and earnings and raised full-year earnings guidance. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”\n\n10. Snowflake Inc.

(NYSE:SNOW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSnowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), a cloud-based data platform company, is positioned well to help enterprises better leverage their own data to get the most out of AI models. Though it is still early days in terms of adoption, Snowflake saw workloads for data science, machine learning, and AI use cases grow more than 90% year-over-year in its most recent quarter.”\n\n9.

Cloud revenue was below expectations as Oracle made planning decisions to accommodate some large-scale Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) clients that take longer to bring online.

(NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nGuru’s Stake as of March 11: $719,712\n\nNext on the list of the best Guru stocks is Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n7. Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…”\n\n6.

(NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33.

        "title": "The Scariest Nvidia Statistic That Virtually No One Is Talking About",
        "content": "For the past three decades, Wall Street and investors have been on a never-ending quest to locate the next big investment trend. Some of these trends have completely changed the growth trajectory of the U.S. economy, such as the advent of the internet. For the time being, no innovation is captivating the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadly speaking, AI involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks that would normally fall to humans. What makes AI so intriguing is machine learning, which is what allows software and systems to grow smarter over time, which can translate into higher proficiency at assigned tasks, or perhaps the learning of new tasks.\n\nThe reason AI stocks have skyrocketed is because the technology (in theory) has applications across virtually every sector and industry. It's what compelled the analysts at PwC to predict that AI will add close to $16 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNo company has directly benefited from the AI revolution more than Nvidia\n\nBut make no mistake about it: semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undeniable face of the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nOver the course of a little more than a year, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of AI-accelerated data centers. The company's high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are staples of enterprise-operated high-compute data centers. According to lofty expectations issued last year by analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia could account for a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024.\n\nAnother factor helping Nvidia is that enterprise demand has overwhelmed the supply of its AI GPUs. The law of supply and demand in economics states that if the supply of a good is constrained and demand is high, the price of that good will increase. The simple fact that data center sales growth has increased many multiples faster than Nvidia's cost of revenue demonstrates that the company is enjoying exceptional pricing power on its top-notch GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe potential good news in the current fiscal year -- Nvidia's fiscal 2025 began on Jan. 29, 2024 -- is that GPU production should meaningfully ramp up. Leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is sizably increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity (CoWoS). High-bandwidth memory systems are a practical necessity for AI-accelerated data centers, and they're packaged on CoWoS. With this supply chain issue easing, Nvidia should be able to meet the demand of more enterprise customers this year.\n\nBut in spite of this seemingly perfect scenario, Wall Street's AI darling may be headed for disaster.\n\nThis is the Nvidia statistic that should have optimists doing a double-take\n\nThere is no shortage of reasons why Nvidia could struggle to sustain a market cap in excess of $2 trillion. Just this week I pointed to its historically lofty valuation relative to trailing-12-month sales, as well as the tendency of next-big-thing trends to navigate early-stage bubbles, as viable reasons to be skeptical of Nvidia's surging stock.\n\nBut arguably nothing is scarier than Nvidia's customer concentration.\n\nPrior to Nvidia reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 24, Bloomberg and Barclays Research revealed Nvidia's top customers as a percentage of total sales. The company's four largest customers account for 40% of total revenue and include:\n\nMicrosoft: 15% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 13% Amazon: 6.2% Alphabet: 5.8%\n\nCustomer concentration isn't, by itself, an issue. In fact, you can make a solid argument that having some of the world's most influential innovators as your top customers is an advantage for Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe problem for the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement is that its four largest customers by revenue are actively developing AI chips of their own to complement the Nvidia GPUs they've been purchasing for their high-compute data centers. It's a pretty clear indication that these four companies aim to lessen their reliance on Nvidia's GPUs in subsequent years, or would prefer to completely ditch Nvidia's infrastructure in favor of internally developed technology.\n\nThe other issue is that even if Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet continue to purchase Nvidia's GPUs, we're more than likely witnessing a peak in orders in 2024.\n\nFor example, Meta spent almost $27.3 billion on property and equipment last year. The 350,000 H100 GPUs the company is purchasing from Nvidia will come at a cost of up to $10.5 billion. That's a pretty sizable percentage of Meta's annual capital expenditures coming from a single purchase, which almost certainly isn't going to be duplicated in future years. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted that his company will have \"around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs\" by the end of 2024. Presumably, Meta's chief is intimating the use of Meta's in-house-developed AI chips along with Nvidia's H100 GPUs.\n\nThe point being that Nvidia's top customers are either moving away from its GPU technology, or are highly unlikely to sustain their existing order activity beyond the current year. This is a potentially scary scenario for Wall Street's hottest AI stock that's receiving very little attention.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "IPO Edge’s Jannarone: Eyes on Reddit as 2024 Tech IPO Bellwether – Schwab TV",
        "content": "By Karen E. Roman\n\nIn an interview with Schwab Network’s Nicole Petallides, IPO Edge Editor-in-Chief John Jannarone discussed how Reddit will be the largest IPO to date in 2024, boasting impressive performance metrics including gross margins near 90%, over $800 million in revenue in 2023 and more-than 20% annual growth.\n\nAt a roughly $6.4 billion valuation, Reddit would command a multiple of 8 times trailing sales.  Mr. Jannarone contrasted Reddit’s valuation with prices two years ago, when companies were raising money privately at much higher levels (Reddit had a round at $10 billion).\n\nLooking to how the market will receive the deal, he pointed out that the company has over 18 years of existence and a community of 73 million daily users. He also mentioned how Reddit was profitable in the fourth quarter of 2023 on an Ebitda basis and sees a long-term Ebitda margin of 40%.\n\nMr. Jannarone pointed out how Reddit has faced fewer issues with advertisers than the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) or X (previous Twitter) and it should serve as a good foundation for the business. What’s more, Reddit has big revenue potential using data to support machine learning (ML) and AI models which need to be trained. Reddit focuses on text interactions and does not rely on videos, making it cheaper to run and easy for ML and AI programs to process the collected data.\n\nFor a window into more up and coming companies, readers are welcome to watch our fireside chats from the New York Stock Exchange, were IPO Edge recently sat down with CEOs and C-suite leaders of companies like Stavvy, Controlled Thermal Resources, Virtru, ThoughSpot, Semperis, Diligent and others. Full interviews are available on IPO-Edge.com and investors can also subscribe to a newsletter for updates on the homepage.\n\nTo watch the full Schwab interview with Ms. Petallides and Mr. Jannarone see below or visit IPO-Edge.com.\n\nContact:\n\nIPO Edge\n\nwww.IPO-Edge.com\n\nEditor@IPO-Edge.com",

        "title": "Why a possible TikTok ban could face an uphill climb after passing House",
        "content": "The House of Representatives advanced a controversial bill Wednesday to give China's ByteDance six months to divest TikTok or face a US ban on the app, a vote that surfaced national security concerns and scrambled Washington's usual partisan alliances.\n\n\"We have given TikTok a clear choice,\" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said Wednesday. If ByteDance doesn't divest, the company will \"side with the [Chinese Communist Party] and face the consequences.\"\n\nBut the legislation faces major hurdles in the weeks ahead. The Senate has shown less enthusiasm and is concerned about potential legal potholes. The signals from the upper chamber are that it could consider the bill slowly, if at all.\n\nThe proceedings in the House were injected with a dose of drama after a last-minute reversal from former President Trump on the issue following four years in office where he'd aggressively pushed for a ban.\n\nNonetheless, a large majority of the chamber's Republicans ended up bucking their party’s presumptive nominee and supported the bipartisan bill with 197 in favor and just 15 opposed.\n\nThe measure was also opposed by 50 Democrats, with some on party's left flank suggesting getting behind a ban could hurt the party with young voters this November.\n\nThe overall vote was a broad bipartisan tally of 352-65. The logo of the app TikTok is seen on the screen of a smartphone. (Fabian Sommer/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nWhat the bill does\n\nThe bill, if enacted, would set in motion a process that could lead to a ban on a key news source for young people and one with 170 million American users. But it's also an app that collects vast amounts of information about Americans and is owned by a company, ByteDance, that its critics say is under the control of the Chinese government.\n\nByteDance executives regularly deny the charge and say they operate separately from China's government. The company immediately slammed the vote saying “this process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it's a ban.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBut national security concerns have fueled the surge in support in recent weeks with Washington moving at rapid speed. The legislation was only introduced about a week ago by Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) — who run the House's China select committee.\n\nIt quickly won a unanimous House committee vote and, with today's tally, has now cleared another key hurdle.\n\nThe bipartisan energy for the idea was also fueled by movement within the Biden administration. The Treasury Department has been looking at reining in TikTok through their Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) but a lack of action there has frustrated lawmakers and helped make this week's quick action possible.\n\nThe bill names both TikTok and ByteDance in its first line and that specificity may be one of the objections in the weeks ahead as the bill is considered by the Senate.\n\nIt could complicate the chances of final passage or later be the subject of legal challenges.\n\nDemocrat Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress at age 27, encapsulated the potential issues ahead when he told CNN \"I don't think it'll be helpful with young voters,\" but also adding that \"taking a step back, I just think it's bad policy.\"\n\nThe bill's supporters argue instead that it's not a ban but a more legally defensible divestiture requirement which has more historical precedents, notably a successful move to force China's owners of Grindr to divest in 2020.\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) tried to draw the distinction, saying \"it's important to note that this legislation does not enact a ban on TikTok.\" He predicted that if the law goes into effect, ByteDance would sell \"to whoever is the highest bidder\" and the app would remain available.\n\nIt was a point that supporters in both parties tried to echo on the eve of the vote.\n\n\"This is not a ban on TikTok,\" former Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the final debate on the bill. \"It's an attempt to make TikTok better.\"\n\nLast minute politicking\n\nThe politics of the bill were also complicated by Trump's recent 180-degree turn on the issue.\n\nHe first proclaimed his position change in a social media post, arguing that getting rid of TikTok would help Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook (META), a company he referred to as \"a true Enemy of the People!\"\n\nIn a CNBC interview this week, Trump doubled down on his position even as he acknowledged that TikTok was a national security risk. He also denied that his change in position came because of a recent meeting with a large Republican donor who is heavily invested in the app.\n\n\"It was a meeting that lasted for a few minutes,\" Trump said of a recent gathering with hedge fund manager Jeff Yass who reportedly has a roughly $21 billion personal investment in the app. \"He never mentioned TikTok,\" Trump added. ROME, GEORGIA - MARCH 9: Donald Trump addresses the crowd inside the Donald Trump Get Out The Vote Rally at the Forum River Center in Rome, Georgia on Saturday, March 9, 2024 (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nOn Capitol Hill, some Trump allies nonetheless echoed his arguments, with Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky calling the bill the \"Facebook Protection and Enhancement Act.\"\n\nEither way, the bill now heads to the Senate,\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hasn't signaled his next move yet beyond saying he'll consult with his members. He could send the bill to committee, which would slow it down.\n\nTikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew is also expected on Capitol Hill this week and in perhaps a telling move, his company is focusing their lobbying efforts on the Senate.\n\n\"We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,\" the company’s statement on Wednesday read.\n\nAnd many in that chamber have been more skeptical, with Sen. John Cornyn of Texas telling PunchBowl News that \"I want to make sure it will actually be effective.\"\n\nThe bill could also face rising opposition from TikTok creators who have also been making their presence known on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nViral TikTok Content Creator Nadya Okamoto said in a Yahoo Finance Live interview \"I've told the team at TikTok, we're ready to go to bat — put us in, coach. We're ready to go.\"\n\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Atmos Energy Corporation, Consolidated Water and Toll Brothers",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nFebruary Jobs Report Shows a Mid-Year Rate Cut: 5 Winners\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell always emphasized that interest rate cuts later this year will be fitting, but they are reliant on the path of the economy.\n\nTalking about the economy, the labor market continued to exhibit strength with 275,000 nonfarm jobs added in February, much higher than the forecasted 200,000, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Payrolls are, thus, almost double the number of monthly jobs needed to keep up with growth among the working-age population.\n\nHowever, it's the rise in the unemployment level and moderation in wage growth that has bolstered the expectation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in June.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% in February. It has been hovering at 3.7% in the previous three-month period. When it comes to wage growth, average hourly earnings increased 4.3% year over year, less than expectations of a 4.5% annual pace. Notably, average hourly earnings increased 4.4% year over year in January.\n\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has kept the benchmark fed funds rate steady between 5.25% and 5.5%. The central bank intends to lower the rate by the end of this year and further trim rates in 2025 as inflationary pressure has slowed down considerably amid a resilient economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nNow, with the Fed likely to remain dovish and trim interest rates this year, tech, utility and construction companies are positioned to gain the most. Tech stocks thrive in a low-interest rate environment. This is because, in the case of rising interest rates, the future cash inflows of tech companies are affected, leading to an increase in borrowing costs and lesser profit margins. Hence, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players.\n\nStory continues\n\nUtility companies, being capital-intensive, have higher levels of debt. In a low-interest rate scenario, their debt levels decrease, helping such companies pay off dues and register profits. Construction businesses also benefit from lower interest rates since the borrowing cost of projects is reduced.\n\nWe have thus highlighted five stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., Atmos Energy Corporation, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. and Toll Brothers, Inc. that are well-positioned to make the most of the Fed's aim to trim interest rates. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 16.1% over the past 60 days.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 13, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT\n\nThe Magnificent 3: Unveiling the Top Tech Titans\n\nFor over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia's stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren't looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by the other companies that have been grouped in for the past year before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "7 Elite Blue-Chip Stocks Predicted to Double Your Fortune by 2028",
        "content": "While searching for investment, there is a search for the holy grail. These are the stocks that have the potential to multiply returns exponentially. Here is a selected group of seven blue-chip stocks, each with a trajectory to double investment by 2028.\n\nThese are robust, time-tested giants dominating their respective industries. These titans are shaping digital tech to the pharmaceutical powerhouses driving medical advancement. As a result, these stocks are pillars of growth and stability in the lucid market.\n\nThe first one has an expansive user base, and the second one dominates the digital payment ecosystem. Similarly, the third leads to high-growth markets, and the fourth is resilient against industry fluctuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach one stops on revelations that will illuminate the fundamentals of wealth creation. At their core, these companies represent the epitome of the operational edge, harnessing cutting-edge technology, strategic partnerships, and decisive leads to breed astronomical growth.\n\nRead more to learn the fundamentals behind these companies and their potential for high returns.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) has a solid user base expansion that serves as fundamental support for its growth momentum. Notably, the Family Daily Active People (DAP) average for December 2023 was 3.19 billion, marking an 8% increase year-over-year (YoY). Similarly, Family Monthly Active People (MAP), as of December 2023, hit 3.98 billion, reflecting a 6% YoY boost.\n\nFundamentally, the steady growth in both DAP and MAP indicates Meta’s lead in retaining existing users while attracting new ones. This prolonged user engagement is the basis for Meta’s business model. Hence, this boosts the edge of its advertising platform and solidifies its ecosystem.  This makes t one of those blue-chip stocks.\n\nBeyond the consolidated user base, Meta can sustain user engagement across its platforms, particularly on Facebook. This reinforces its status as a leading social media conglomerate. Facebook has an average of 2.11 billion DAUs for December 2023, representing a 6% increase YoY. Similarly, Facebook MAUs hit 3.07 billion as of December 2023, reflecting a 3% YoY boost.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, despite being a mature platform, Facebook continues to attract new users and retain existing ones. Meta is sharp at fostering user engagement, essential for maximizing ad revenue and monetizing leads.\n\nPayPal (PYPL)\n\nPayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) top-line growth and margin expansion represent the fundamental capability to monetize its operations sharply. Net revenues increased 9% in Q4 and 8% in 2023, indicating prolonged top-line growth. Meanwhile, the expansion of GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins reflects PayPal’s progress in managing costs and improving operational edge. These trends mark high financial performance and suggest PayPal’s solid foundation for growth.\n\nSimilarly, total payment volume (TPV) increased by 15% in Q4. Similarly, the growth was 13% for 2023 to hit $1.53 trillion. Payment transactions grew by 13% in Q4, from 12% in 2023 (to 25.0 billion). The transaction volume growth highlights PayPal’s fundamental capability to attract more users and facilitate a higher volume of transactions through its platform. Thus, the double-digit percentage increases in TPV and payment transactions indicate solid user engagement and adoption of PayPal’s services. It’s therefore one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.\n\nOverall, these trends reflect PayPal’s increasing relevance in the digital payment ecosystem and its growing valuation potency based on its edge as a preferred choice for consumers and businesses.\n\nIntel (INTC) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) ‘s Q4 top-line is $15.4 billion, a considerable 10% increase YoY. The Q4 top-line growth indicates positive momentum for Intel, likely based on solid product offerings and market demand.\n\nAdditionally, Intel Foundry Services (IFS) targets being the second-largest external foundry by 2030. It has strategic agreements with over 40 partners across various domains, including Electronic Design Automation (EDA) services, IP, and cloud services. Similarly, agreements with companies like ARM (NASDAQ:ARM) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) broaden the foundry ecosystem.\n\nExpansion into high-growth markets like mobile, communication infrastructure, and networking through collaborations and developments. Intel focuses on expanding its foundry business through strategic agreements and collaborations. This indicates an inclination toward diversifying revenue streams and capitalizing on growing semiconductor demand.\n\nOverall, emphasizing high-growth markets further solidifies Intel’s lead in the foundry business.\n\nTSMC (TSM) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTSMC (NYSE:TSM) has established itself as a leader in advanced process technologies, a vital aspect of its growth strategy. The company focuses on cutting-edge nodes such as 3-nanometer (N3), 5-nanometer (N5), and 7-nanometer (N7). Hence, this fab focus may add considerably to its competitive edge.\n\nIn Q4 2023, shipments of 3-nanometer technology held 15% of total wafer revenue. Meanwhile, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer techs led 35% and 17% of the revenue, respectively. Collectively, advanced technologies (7-nanometer and below) represented 67% of the revenue. This suggests TSMC’s solid traction in commercializing the advanced semiconductor nodes.\n\nFor 2023, the contribution of advanced techs to wafer revenue boosted to 58% (in 2023) from 53% (in 2022). This upward trend signifies TSMC’s focus on advancing its process tech. This aligns with industry demands and fosters growth. TSMC’s top-line diversification across platforms leads to higher valuation growth potential. The company caters to multiple sectors and verticals, including high-performance computing (HPC), smartphones, the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and data center enterprise (DCE).\n\nFor instance, in Q4 2023, HPC and smartphone segments each accounted for 43% of revenue, followed by IoT (5%), automotive (5%), and DCE (2%). Despite fluctuations, TSMC maintains a balanced revenue distribution. Therefore, this minimizes the risks associated with dependency on a single sector. It’s also one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Hands of medical professional holding a syringe, symbolizing VCNX stock.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/PhotobyTawat\n\nPfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) solid revenues for 2023 hit $58.5 billion. Despite the decline in COVID revenues and excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, the company delivered an operational top-line growth of 7% YoY. This growth suggests that Pfizer’s other products can offset the decline in COVID-19 product revenues.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer had a record year with nine new molecular entity approvals and approvals for new indications. Furthermore, completing the Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) acquisition boosted (doubled) its oncology resources and efforts, placing Pfizer as a leader in various cancer treatments. There is continued investment in research across therapeutic areas outside of oncology. These include vaccines, anti-infectives, internal medicine, metabolic diseases, inflammation, and immunology.\n\nFinally, Pfizer returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D in 2023. It also invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, primarily the Seagen acquisition, demonstrating strategic investment in growth leads. Hence, this strategic allocation may support solid valuation boosts in the upcoming quarters.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) derived considerable free cash flow, which hit $6.2 billion in 2023. The company also repaid $5.4 billion in debt, reducing its net leverage to 3.9 times EBITDA. Fundamentally, this solid FCF generation and debt reduction signify the company’s discipline and capability to manage its capital structure sharply.\n\nAdditionally, the Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) segment saw impressive growth, with global subscribers reaching nearly 98 million by the end of Q4 2023. Despite some domestic declines, international subscriber growth remained solid, with over 1 million subscribers gained in Q4 alone. D2C advertising revenue accelerated considerably. This is increasing by over 50% in Q4, driven by higher engagement on Max and ad-lite subscriber growth. In short, these metrics indicate Warner Bros Discovery’s progressive penetration into the streaming market and its fundamental capability to monetize its streaming platform sharply. All in all, it’s one of those blue-chip stocks.\n\nDespite challenges such as strikes impacting content production, Warner Bros Discovery continued to invest in content creation, as evidenced by its focus on relaunching its theatrical animation division and producing original programming. Finally, strategic partnerships, such as the deal with A24 to bring theatrical releases exclusively to Max, further enrich the company’s content offering and competitiveness.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVerizon’s (NYSE:VZ) wireless service revenue for 2023 stood at $76.7 billion, reflecting a 3.2% YoY increase. This growth indicates Verizon’s solid position in the wireless market, derived from leveraging its network infrastructure and client-centric offerings to drive revenue expansion. The constant YoY growth demonstrates Verizon’s capability to capture market share and adapt to consumer demands.\n\nTowards the bottom line, Verizon attained an adjusted EBITDA of $47.8 billion in 2023, leading to a solid FCF of $18.7 billion. Verizon has a disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth, focusing on its operational edge and financial standing. Additionally, Verizon’s fundamental capability to raise its dividend for the 17th consecutive year and an adequate FCF dividend payout ratio of approximately 59% reflects its focus on valuation expansion.\n\nFurthermore, Verizon experienced considerable net-added growth. In mobility, Verizon added 449K postpaid phone net adds in Q4 2023, based on the boosted performance in both consumer and Verizon business segments. Additionally, Verizon Business attained its 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125K. Hence, this is a reflection of solid client demand and satisfaction. In broadband, Verizon attained over 1.7 million net adds for 2023, with fixed wireless access leading considerably to the growth momentum. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in META, PYPL, INTC, TSM, PFE, WBD, and VZ.

        "title": "Why SoundHound AI, Nvidia, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied Today",
        "content": "There's little question that the catalyst that sparked the current bull market rally is artificial intelligence (AI). The AI gold rush that kicked off last year is gathering steam, but market watchers continue to question the resilience of this upward momentum. However, robust results from one company provided a lift for a number of AI stocks.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, audio AI specialist SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) surged 13.6%, chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 4.9%, and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) climbed 2.4%, as of 1:47 p.m. ET.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of catalysts to explain the move higher. This seems to suggest that it was the results of another company that drove AI stocks upward. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEvidence the adoption of AI is spreading\n\nThe catalyst that seems to have sparked a rally among AI stocks was a surprisingly strong earnings report from database specialist Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The results provided evidence that demand for AI is spreading.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), Oracle reported revenue of $13.3 billion, which grew 7% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, up 16%. While that might not seem like much to write home about, the devil is in the details, with two items of particular interest.\n\nOracle's cloud revenue was the headliner, growing 25% year over year to $5.1 billion. Even more impressive was the company's cloud infrastructure results, which climbed 52% year over year. This outpaced the growth of Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure -- also known as the \"Big Three\" cloud providers -- which grew 13%, 26%, and 30%, respectively. This suggests that either Oracle took market share from its closest cloud competitors, or that demand for cloud services is growing -- though both could be true.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales not yet booked as revenue, surged 29% to $80 billion. Since RPO gives insight in future revenue trends, this suggests Oracle's sales growth seems destined to continue.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz also noted that AI cloud capacity \"substantially exceeds supply.\" As a result, Oracle is \"opening new and expanding existing cloud data centers very, very rapidly.\"\n\nThe chief executive also noted the company recently signed a \"big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with Nvidia\" in the third quarter, but also hinted there's more on the docket. \"We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week\" during Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC).\n\nThis all but confirms that it was the accelerating demand for AI that boosted Oracle's results, which has broader implications for other companies in the AI space.\n\nProfiting from AI\n\nWe're only just beginning to comprehend just how prevalent generative AI will be, but these highlighted companies have each carved out a niche for themselves in the AI gold rush:\n\nSoundHound AI creates AI-powered voice and audio solutions serving the restaurant and automotive industries. The company's tools can be used for restaurant drive-thrus, phone banks, and self-serve kiosks, among others. Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) with the computational horsepower required by AI systems. The company has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales growth in each of the preceding three quarters thanks to growing demand for AI. Meta Platforms has long used AI to advance its business, surfacing relevant content to its social media users, as well as directing its targeted advertising efforts. Meta also developed LLaMA AI, one of the most in-demand large language models available on the major cloud infrastructure sites.\n\nEach of these stocks is relatively inexpensive, depending on your favored valuation metric. Meta and Nvidia currently sell for 25 times and 36 times forward earnings, respectively, making them the standout choices -- particularly given their history of strong growth. SoundHound AI isn't yet profitable and sells for 20 times sales, making it more expensive and certainly riskier.\n\nThe trend toward AI adoption is unmistakable, offering investors plenty of ways to profit from the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans",
        "content": "For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple, Alphabet and Tesla\n\nThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.\n\nApple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.\n\nThis seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.\n\nAs AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.\n\nAdditionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.\n\nAlphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.\n\nOr course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.\n\nWhile major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.\n\nUntil this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "March 12 (Reuters) - Google is restricting AI chatbot Gemini from answering questions about the global elections set to happen this year, the Alphabet-owned firm said on Tuesday, as it looks to avoid potential missteps in the deployment of the technology.\n\nThe update comes at a time when advancements in generative AI, including image and video generation, have fanned concerns of misinformation and fake news among the public, prompting governments to regulate the technology.\n\nWhen asked about elections such as the upcoming U.S. presidential match-up between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Gemini responds with \"I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search\".\n\nGoogle had announced restrictions within the U.S. in December, saying they would come into effect ahead of the election.\n\n\"In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we are restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,\" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.\n\nAside from the United States, national elections are set to be held in several large countries including South Africa and India, the world's largest democracy.\n\nIndia has asked tech firms to seek government approval before the public release of AI tools that are \"unreliable\" or under trial, and to label them for the potential to return wrong answers.\n\nGoogle's AI products are under the scanner after inaccuracies in some historical depictions of people created by Gemini forced it to pause the chatbot's image-generation feature late last month.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai had said the company was working to fix those issues and called the chatbot's responses \"biased\" and \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nFacebook-parent Meta Platforms said last month it will set up a team to tackle disinformation and the abuse of generative AI in the run-up to European Parliament elections in June.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "title": "7 Cybersecurity Stocks That Meta Should Consider Buying",
        "content": "41 state attorneys general have penned a letter to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) expressing concerns over the increasing number of complaints about hacked Facebook and Instagram accounts, as Wired reported last week. There could be a solution to this. One of them is for Meta to scour the landscape of cybersecurity stocks and select some for acquisition targets.\n\nSome of the illicit activities the platform faces include charging large sums to stored credit cards or running unauthorized advertisements. As cybercrime rises worldwide, the prevalence of scams on sites like Facebook has seemingly gotten worse and more brazen. The letter reported a significant increase in complaints between 2019 and 2023, with victims being left in the dark and reportedly tying up the resources of law enforcement officials dealing with the aftermath.\n\nSo, in this article, I’ve proposed seven cybersecurity stocks that Meta could acquire to help protect its web properties and potentially restore some lost trust by users who hackers and cyber criminals have burned in the past.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: Fortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is one of those cybersecurity stocks that Meta could potentially acquire. Although FTNT’s market cap of around 54 billion at the time of writing is arguably pricey, the company’s outlook over the short term looks attractive.\r\n\r\nFTNT stock is expected to grow by approximately 10% CAGR in 2024. The company has projected revenue for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of $1.30 billion to $1.36 billion. Billings are in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.45 billion.\n\nThe company is expecting a shift in the cybersecurity industry which is central to its strategy. Fortinet, citing Gartner, notes that 97% of organizations have plans for vendor consolidation, highlighting the industry’s shift towards fewer, more dominant players in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, FTNT’s earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow 19.57% this year, which could mean that the company will soon be valued higher.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) could be an attractive pick for a Meta acquisition, as it currently serves over 40% of Fortune 500 companies, which could open the door for Meta to cross-sell some of its complementary enterprise services.\n\nZS stock’s price tag is slightly lower, with a market cap of just 29 billion. But like with the other cybersecurity stocks on this list, the company’s outlook and recent financial performance have been impressive.\r\n\r\nFor Q2 2024, Zscaler expects EPS in the range of 57 cents to 58 cents and revenue between $505 million and $507 million. The full fiscal year 2024 projections include an EPS of $2.45 to $2.48, revenue of $2.09 billion to $2.1 billion, and operating income between $360 million and $365 million.\n\nAnother draw card for ZS in terms of acquisition by Meta is its Zero Trust Exchange platform, which connects users directly to apps and eliminates traditional security vulnerabilities. This could be key to preventing the mass of account takeovers for Meta if successfully integrated.\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: CrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is known for safeguarding critical cloud workloads and could prove to be an accretive acquisition for Meta; both in terms of its potential synergy with its core business as well as a potentially lucrative diversifier.\n\nCRWD recently reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines, with earnings per share of 95 cents adjusted compared to an expected 82 cents, and revenue of $845 million versus an expected $839 million. Full-year revenue increased by 36% year-over-year (YOY), reaching $3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, it has expected revenues between $902 million and $906 million for the next quarter surpassing the consensus estimate. Similarly, earnings per share for the period are expected to be between 89 cents and 90 cents, also exceeding the consensus estimate. It is also committed to achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWith a market cap of 77 billion, CRWD is one of the more expensive companies on this list, but an acquisition by META could be highly accretive. Its EPS should swell to 7.11 before FY2028, up from 2.81 at the time of writing. With its specialty in safeguarding the cloud and significant commercial relationships, it could pan out to be a strong investment.\n\nVaronis Systems (VRNS) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nVaronis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) is one of those small-cap cybersecurity stocks with a market cap of just 5.4 billion. Its valuation alone could be a substantial deciding factor in making it an acquisition target for META. Its specialization in Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) takes the cake, though. DPSM allows organizations to see where their sensitive data is and who has access to it. These are two things that META could leverage to help secure its user accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, VRNS is undergoing a SaaS transition, aiming to complete it by 2026, a year earlier than previously anticipated. Once complete, the transition should comprise 70% to 90% of the company’s total ARR.\r\n\r\nVaronis also finished FY2023 with an ARR of $543 million, a 17% YOY increase. It saw a substantial boost in free cash flow to $54.3 million in 2023 from $0.5 million the previous year.\n\nSaaS companies, in general, can be lucrative acquisition targets. This is especially true for companies that already heavily rely on SaaS, such as META. META’s existing book of business could also synergize well with its offerings.\n\nCybersecurity Stocks: CyberArk (CYBR) CyberArk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) specializes in privileged access management. This is a crucial step towards mitigating illegal account takeovers for META users.\n\nThe company expects its total revenue for the full year to range between $920 million and $930 million. This surpasses the consensus estimate of $915.82 million. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue is forecasted to be between $209 million and $215 million, again beating the consensus estimate of $207.25 million​.\n\nA great thing about CYBR is its market cap, standing at $11 billion, and analysts are also bullish on the company’s long-term prospects.\n\nAlthough there’s a slight predicted decrease for its stock price within the next twelve months, its EPS is predicted to skyrocket 89.45% next year, which would put it firmly in profitability at 1.79.\n\nBuying small-growing companies while they are still cheap to scoop up can be a viable strategy. Furthermore, its privileged access management software could potentially plug some holes in META’s stock stack. Thus, CYBR is one of those cybersecurity stocks for the company to consider acquiring.\n\nCheck Point (CHKP) Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy: Check Point Software (CHKP)\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) is a key player in the cybersecurity space, emphasizing comprehensive protection for its clients. This is despite its slightly lower valuation relative to some of its peers at 18 billion at the time of writing.\n\nIn its most recent earnings for Q4 2023, CHKP surpassed analyst expectations with an EPS of $2.57, which was 10 cents higher than the consensus estimate of $2.47. The company’s revenue for the quarter stood at $663.50 million, slightly above the forecast of $662.09 million.\n\nThe reason I like CHKP is that its offerings could synergize well with the needs of META. Namely, it offers a comprehensive suite of services, which the market is steadily heaving towards as a long-term trend. This then positions it well for the future.\n\nMeanwhile, the company gave an EPS range for 2024 that will be between $8.70 and $9.30, against a consensus estimate of $9.05. Revenue expectations are set between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, aligning with the consensus revenue estimate of $2.5 billion.\n\nOkta (OKTA) Okta, Inc. Logo seen on billboard. Okta (formerly Saasure Inc.) is an American identity and access management company based in San Francisco\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the last of those cybersecurity stocks among potential good fits for a Meta acquisition. The company’s valuation dipped into the $80 range this year but has since rebounded.\n\nThe key reason I believe that OKTA could be a good target is that in addition to providing robust cloud security services, the company is also undervalued relative to its long-term growth potential, which could be accretive for the acquiring business.\n\nMeanwhile, OKTA’s outlook seems robust. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company is projecting EPS to be between 54 cents and 55 cents. Revenue expectations range from $603 million to $605 million. This guidance surpasses the consensus revenue estimate of $584.9 million.\n\nAlso, at an $18 billion market cap, the firm’s assets and future free cash flows could be cheap for META to acquire. Additionally, it provides further opportunities to grow its earnings via offering additional enterprise services to its customer base.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 12, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Meta Platforms, Inc META, Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Perion Network PERI and Carlisle Companies Inc.CSL.\n\nAdd These 4 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks to Strengthen Your Portfolio\n\nIdentifying stocks that offer healthy returns may be tricky for investors. In such a scenario, one may consider liquidity levels, which are a good indicator of a company's financial health.\n\nLiquidity measures a company's ability to meet short-term debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors' radar owing to their potential to offer alluring returns.\n\nNonetheless, one should be careful about investing in a stock with a high liquidity level, as it may also suggest that the company cannot utilize assets effectively. It is advisable to consider a company's efficiency level and liquidity to identify potential winners.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company's potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — the 'acid-test ratio' or 'quick assets ratio' — indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\nA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company's financial condition.\n\nHere are four stocks out of the 13 that qualified for the screen:\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc is the world's biggest social media platform. The company is gaining from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increasing engagement on its other platforms, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook, has been a major growth catalyst.

Challenging macroeconomic conditions are a persistent concern for Meta's advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.94 per share, up 13.2% in the past 60 days. META has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.7%, on average.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corp. is a leading designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. The company sells products primarily under five proprietary brands — UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk and Other brands (mainly comprising Koolaburra).

Proactive consumer engagement strategies and omni-channel distribution bolster its competitive edge.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 bottom line is pegged at $26.85 per share, up 13.7% in the past 60 days.

The company is set to benefit from its focus on delivering innovative new products. Its diversified business structure enables it to tap opportunities and neutralize operating risks associated with a single market.\n\nRobust repair and remodel demand across the building envelope in commercial and residential markets augurs well for the CWT segment. Synergies from several buyouts are likely to drive top-line growth. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging.

        "title": "12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 most reliable dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nDuring times of economic turmoil, investors often shift their attention toward dividend stocks, which provide regular income streams. The reliability of these stocks depends on factors such as their historical growth performance, cash flow stability, payout ratios, and overall financial health reflected in their balance sheets. Among these, dividend growth emerges as the most important factor when considering investing in dividend stocks. Moreover, historical returns have shown the outperformance of dividend growth strategies over an average dividend stock. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, outperformed the broader market with lower volatility over the long run. The report also mentioned that the index demonstrates its capacity to offer downside protection through its upside and downside capture ratios. The index surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time.\n\nDividend stocks that offer both a substantial yield and a track record of consistent dividend growth strike a balance between distributing dividends to shareholders and reinvesting capital into future growth endeavors. Nuveen reported FactSet data which showed that dividends per share rose by 5% in the S&P 500, and it is anticipated that there will be similar growth in 2024 based on consensus estimates. In addition to this, over 325 companies within the index either raised their dividends per share or introduced a dividend over the past year.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the payout ratio holds a significant importance when assessing the dependability of dividend stocks. Companies with high payout ratios may face challenges in future growth, which could jeopardize both stock price appreciation and dividend growth. Fortunately, the S&P 500’s dividend payout ratio remains below its long-term average. Consensus estimates also indicate an 11% growth in earnings per share for 2024, which should support attractive returns for shareholders. Moreover, companies are maintaining substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets, with cash totaling roughly $2 trillion as of September 2023, nearing the highest levels in two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough dividend stocks didn’t perform as well as the broader market in 2024, analysts have given a positive stance about dividend equities this year. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for dividend payouts in the S&P 500. The firm stated that there has been a surge in investors' attraction towards dividend-paying stocks following Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s recent announcement of its inaugural quarterly dividend. The firm’s analysts noted this heightened interest and consequently revised their forecast for the S&P 500's dividend-per-share payout, increasing it from 4% to 6%. Another reason contributing to the optimism regarding dividends among Goldman's team is the trend of major US corporations consistently exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations during the last quarter of 2023. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies are steadily increasing their payouts. Goldman reported that since the beginning of 2024, 56 companies within the S&P 500 index have increased their dividends, with a median increase of 6%. Among these, financial firms and industrial companies, totaling 10 and nine respectively, have played a significant role in driving the overall increase.\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades and have strong balance sheets include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). In this article, we will further take a look at reliable dividend stocks. 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDaily newspaper economy stock market chart\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we used a stock screener to identify dividend stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 15 consecutive years and had payout ratios of below 35% in 2023. Low payout ratios indicate that these companies have a robust cash position and are retaining a larger portion of their earnings rather than distributing them as dividends. Among this selection, we selected 12 companies with the lowest payout ratios and arranged them in ascending order based on their payout ratios in 2023. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database as of Q4 2023.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOn Monday morning, former President Donald Trump said in an interview, \"I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people.\"\n\nOn Monday, Meta Platforms (META) stock fell 4%.\n\nMeta's decline outpaced the 0.4% drop seen in the tech-heavy Nasdaq to start the week and served as perhaps the first reminder to investors riding the \"Magnificent Seven\" trade that election risk matters to them too.\n\nThe US presidential election is just eight months away, with a confirmed rematch between Trump and Biden. And when either candidate mentions public companies, investors need to pay attention.\n\nNow, investors have calendars like everyone else. Which means we entered 2024 with \"election risks\" serving as a talking point for almost all strategists asked to proffer views on where things would be headed in the new year. And they were able to do so with little to fear — elections have been generally good news for US stocks, as Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick recently outlined.\n\nAnd the news for the benchmark index is rarely better than when a sitting president is up for reelection — in 10 prior instances since 1952, the S&P 500 has never logged a down year in an election year under a new president, with the average return standing at 12.2%. The S&P 500 hasn't had a down year when a president is up for reelection. (Source: Carson Group)\n\nBut the S&P 500 always going up during election years that resemble 2024 doesn't take political risk off the table for every member of the index over the entirety of that year.\n\nAsked during an interview with CNBC for his view on recent efforts in Congress to ban TikTok, a policy Trump pursued as president which he's since cooled on, Trump said: \"... without TikTok, you could make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump holding an anti-Meta position is not exactly new for the former president.\n\nTrump was suspended from Facebook and Instagram following the Jan. 6 insurrection and was reinstated last year. In the interim, Trump took up posting on his own social network, Truth Social, which is set to go public via a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). DWAC stock fell 2% on Monday, but has more than doubled in 2024.\n\nMeta, for its part, has been one of the most important drivers of the market's overall return this year.\n\nData from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre showed that through last Thursday, Meta's market cap gains — which took the social media giant's market value north of $1.3 trillion from around $900 billion at the start of 2024 — accounted for 12.3% of the S&P 500's entire market cap growth this year.\n\nGiven Trump's commentary Monday was both against Facebook and, however timidly, in support of TikTok remaining available in the US, Monday's reaction in Meta stock brings in two possible challenges for the company in a second Trump administration.\n\nThe first is straightforward — all else equal, companies would prefer the sitting or incoming president of the United States not call them an \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nThe second is one wonders to what extent Meta's rally this year has been underwritten by a potential ban of TikTok that might, as Trump outlined, consolidate the company's power.\n\nHow, if, or why either of these theses — among others, like AI, the metaverse, etc. — should weigh on Meta's stock on Monday, Tuesday, or any day of the week is why markets remain endlessly fascinating.\n\nReal-time disagreements on what does or does not matter to a given company and how that may or may not impact the value of that company's future discounted cash flows are, literally, the things that make a market.\n\nAnd tracking the source of these fissures, from a research note to an executive interview to a former president's commentary, is why there's never a boring day in modern financial markets.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Expect Controversy, and Stick to Your Plan",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is almost constantly a topic of controversy. Should this alter your plan to participate in Meta Platforms’ awesome revenue growth? The choice is yours to make, but I am bullish on META stock and don’t imagine that this Magnificent Seven member will slow down anytime soon.\n\nAbove all else, Meta Platforms is a social-media platform provider that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, along with Reels and Threads. At the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta Platforms to be a strong competitor in the Metaverse as well as artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nYou’ve probably heard about Meta Platforms being the target of regulatory pressure in the U.S. and Europe. This hasn’t stopped META stock from rising over the past several years, though. Yet, there’s a new development that might derail Meta Platforms’ growth story — or maybe not, so let’s get into the details now.\n\nWhy Meta Platforms Was in the Red Today\n\nOverall, the U.S. stock market was a bit shaky today, but it held fairly steady. However, even though Meta Platforms is a “Magnificent Seven” company, its stock wasn’t very magnificent today.\n\nAs META stock slipped over 4%, investors might have wondered whether Zuckerberg had made a startling announcement. In actuality, however, the source of the consternation on Wall Street came not from Zuckerberg but from a famous political figure.\n\nSpecifically, former President Donald Trump had some less-than-flattering things to say about Meta Platforms. The main topic of his recent rant was rival social-media platform TikTok, which Trump considered banning when he was president.\n\nAs I see it, it’s important for investors to be aware of what’s in the news, even if they’re not taking a particular position. So, here’s what happened. According to Reuters, Trump declared that “There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok” and that “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.” So, it seems that Trump might not be fully advocating for a TikTok ban right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore central to today’s topic, however, is Trump’s stance on Meta Platforms’ Facebook. Considering how a TikTok ban would benefit Facebook, Trump asserted, “I’m not looking to make Facebook double the size.” The former president added, “I think Facebook has been very dishonest.”\n\nThen, Trump kicked it up a notch. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Trump stated, “I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.”\n\nMeta Platforms Will be a Target but Also a Revenue Generator\n\nGoing forward, investors should just assume that Meta Platforms will be a target of controversy. Zuckerberg isn’t known for “playing nice” with regulators. It seems that he would prefer to continue doing what he’s been doing with Meta Platforms and pay any fines that regulators might impose upon the company.\n\nMeta Platforms has deep pockets, so paying fines isn’t usually a problem. Just take a look at TipRanks’ financials page for Meta Platforms, and you’ll see what I’m talking about. The company grew its revenue from $28.64 billion in the quarter ended March 2023 to $40.11 billion in the quarter ended December 2023.\n\nSpeaking of growth, Meta Platforms’ position of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased over the quarters and reached $65.4 billion by the end of last year. Meta Platforms is so flush with cash that the company is now paying dividends.\n\nNext, I checked Meta Platforms’ earnings page and discovered that the company has consistently grown its quarterly EPS for a year and a half. Furthermore, Meta Platforms has beaten Wall Street’s consensus EPS forecasts for a full year now. Evidently, this social media juggernaut is practically unstoppable when it comes to generating advertising revenue and posting impressive profits.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, META comes in as a Strong Buy based on 40 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Meta Platforms price target is $528.80, implying 9.35% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell META stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Brad Erickson of RBC Capital, with an average return of 76.56% per rating and a 77% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider META Stock?\n\nA fearful attitude would be: “What if Meta Platforms stock keeps falling?” I prefer to take an opportunistic attitude. If the share price goes low enough due to controversy that won’t destroy Meta Platforms, I’ll certainly consider buying META stock.\n\nIt’s also possible to buy Meta Platforms shares now and then think about adding to one’s position if the stock continues to fall. After all, heated debates will come and go, but Meta Platforms will continue to make a whole lot of money.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Ride the AI Cloud Boom to New Heights",
        "content": "An article in the Wall Street Journal from July 2023 indicated that the AI Cloud boom has created significant opportunities for multiple firms in their stocks. The thrust of the article was that Cloud providers largely remained incapable of supporting large AI applications. Even the hyper-scale firms that populate Silicon Valley and its equivalents globally were not considered ready.\n\nThe opportunity continues in 2024: Infrastructure wasn’t designed to run the large complex systems required in AI or to handle such complex calculations. In short, there is as big an opportunity today as there was when the Wall Street Journal ran that article nine months ago.\n\nThe majority of the opportunity lies in North America where AI has grown quickest. However, the opportunity is global in scale. Let’s take a look at seven companies that are poised to continue to ride the AI Cloud boom to new heights.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s begin with Alibaba, (NYSE:BABA) a stock representing the Chinese firm and a market outside of North America. The Chinese market differs from the American market in material ways. That means AI applications also differ.\n\nFor example, one of the more prominent applications of AI that is positively affecting Alibaba is in relation to e-commerce. Firms throughout China tapped Alibaba’s large language model to substantially increase sales on the November 11 shopping event known as Single’s Day.\n\nAlibaba also cited strong results on Single’s Day in its earnings release from early February. And while those results were positive, Alibaba is also reflective of the broader Chinese economy which continues to face substantial issues. The result is that Alibaba’s revenues are essentially flat. Revenues increased by 5% during the period with Cloud revenues growing similarly at 3%. To be clear, that is not acceptable for the firm and led to substantial decreases in net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, that is not the point here. Instead, the point is that Alibaba is among preeminent Cloud providers in China. That positions the company to rebound strongly and is one of the primary reasons that the stock has so much upside at the moment. One reason to believe in that narrative is simply that Alibaba has cut prices on its AI Cloud offering in an effort to spur demand.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) still has a chance to ride the AI Cloud boom higher even though it continues to fumble the opportunity. The stock has dropped dramatically over the past month as the company continues to scramble to catch up.\n\nThere is an ongoing arms race in the AI sector and Alphabet has been behind since day one. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) jumped far ahead of Alphabet in early 2023 when it announced its investment in ChatGPT. It really hasn’t relented since. That has left Google wondering what it can do and taking risks in order to make up ground. The results haven’t been very good frankly. The company is currently facing a firestorm over controversial AI generated images. That is only making its troubles worse.\n\nThe sell-off is an opportunity. January earnings were stronger than expected and rate cuts later this year will propel Tech again into the limelight. Take the bad news as good news for contrarian investors and act.\n\nAlteryx (AYX) The Alteryx (AYX) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) isn’t a household stock name nor is it among the best known firms in relation to the AI cloud boom.  Instead, it is an analytics automation business with a legitimate chance to further establish itself with enterprise customers.That’s particularly important at the moment as many enterprise customers continue to question the value of their previous investments in the AI cloud.\n\nAlteryx is investing in that opportunity. The company recently announced an expanded partnership with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Those new integrations are expected to decrease the time for users to generate AI driven enterprise use cases. Such use cases are a major target area for AI cloud development; it will only increase the speed at which data is produced which will further increase the need for analytics with which to draw actionable insight.\n\nThe expanded partnership has the potential to increase revenues at Alteryx which already was performing strongly. During 2023 sales increased by 13% at the company.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has gone from a company that is highly government-oriented to one that is more commercially oriented of late. The company is again leveraging its government connections and relationships, propelling its stock higher.\n\nPalanitr first established a name as an analytics firm with a more conservative bent. It was highly connected to the government and the defense sector in particular. Then the company continued to grow and ultimately reached profitability which helped to catapult its stock much higher. A big part of that was its AI cloud offerings.\n\nIt was suddenly a more commercially oriented firm. That’s where it stood when the company last released earnings in early February. Commercial revenues grew by 70% during the fourth quarter.  They were catching up to government revenues.\n\nGovernment revenues are surging again though, as the company just landed a $178 million contract for the Army’s project Titan. It will leverage Palantir’s AI for its battlefield systems. That could propel Palantir stock higher again and is a reason to believe in its continued strength as the AI Cloud continues to develop.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is essentially a picks and shovels stock in relation to the AI cloud. The company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven indispensable within the leading cloud companies that provide AI services broadly.\n\nThose GPUs are sold as stand-alone chips and are also sold in combination with a CPU, both of which are used to power the AI cloud. Those chips are known for their parallel processing capability and have been in use for AI for roughly a dozen years.\n\nAgain, it is Nvidia’s GPUs that are far and away in highest demand. That demand is producing incredible sales growth. Nvidia expects $24 billion in revenues in the current quarter. If it reaches that goal it would represent a tripling of sales over the same 12 months prior.\n\nInvestor apprehension is logical given that Nvidia shares traded for roughly $150 in early 2023 and rose to more than $800 by early 2024. Yet, when one considers that revenues are probably going to triple this quarter it is also entirely logical that Nvidia shares are expected to rise as high as $1,400.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) represents Nvidia’s strongest competition. That is the clearest reason to buy the stock as AI cloud applications continue to develop.\n\nWhile Nvidia clearly has the most in demand chips for AI application, their continued dominance isn’t assured. For one, buyers are very clearly seeking alternatives due to high prices for Nvidia chips. Both MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft recently stated that they would switch to AMD’s chips. It is very much worth noting that they buy roughly 60% of all of the chips that Nvidia sold recently.\n\nIt remains clear that AMD will have legitimate opportunities to serve firms like Meta Platforms and Microsoft moving forward. That is a strong catalyst that has propelled AMD shares above $200 recently.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is also targeting the Chinese market which continues to face strong export restrictions from the United States. There is an opportunity there yet AMD will have to weaken the chips that it intends to sell in the country.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another stock to consider in connection to both the country and the ongoing AI cloud opportunity.\n\nBaidu is analogous to the Google of China and provides many similar services. In other words, it is deeply connected to all things internet and artificial intelligence within the country.\n\nThe good news is that Baidu has done better than some other large leading Chinese tech firms on a top line basis. In 2023, revenues grew by 9%. Alibaba, for example, as discussed above, saw its revenues increase by a more modest 5% during the same period.\n\nThe company did not provide a strict break out of cloud AI revenues. However, it did mention that much of its growth during the period was attributable to Cloud AI investments. Baidu represents a contrarian investment that leverages the combined power of a Chinese economic rebound and Cloud AI investment. So, as with Alibaba, there is a lot of future potential in the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 5 Stocks.\n\nOn March 8 Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC said that the latest pullback in AI stocks shows how “fickle” the stock market can be. Cramer said while he is a big “believer” in AI, some stocks in the industry became too hot. While Jim Cramer keeps recommending investors to take some money off the table when stocks run too high, he’s still highly bullish on mega-cap tech stocks and AI plays like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). For example, last week, Jim Cramer advised a caller during his program to “stick” with Meta Platforms. Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”\n\nJim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.\n\nJim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Does Not Like These Stocks in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. With each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment to see what smart money investors think about these stocks.  Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about New York-based REIT Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL). Cramer said it’s one of those commercial real estate companies where he does not know “what they own.” Cramer said he “never recommend these stocks.” Cramer also claimed that he has been right from “day one” about these stocks that’s why he won’t recommend this one.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL).\n\n9. Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer seems extremely disappointed with restaurant chain company Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO). When asked about the stock during his latest program on CNBC, Cramer said he has “lost faith” in Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) management. Cramer said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) insiders were selling the stock all along. He also thinks Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) is an overvalued company. He said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) needs better earnings.\n\nLast month Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) announced Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.07. Revenue in the period jumped 24.5% year over year to $187.9 million, surpassing estimates by $3.68 million.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on PTLO, he's recommending buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n8. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nJim Cramer yet again reiterated his thesis on crypto-related stocks when he was recently asked about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer said it’s better to buy Bitcoin if you want exposure to cryptocurrencies. Cramer said buying Bitcoin or the “Ethereum ETF that’s gonna be coming” would be better than buying Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer was referring to the spot Ethereum ETF that is expected to be approved by the SEC in the coming days.\n\n7. Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nRoku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. When a Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) investor recently asked Cramer about the stock, Cramer said “you are in a house of pain” and he thinks the “door” won’t open anytime soon if someone is looking to sell the stock without bearing losses.\n\nCramer said he does not want to “be there” on Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) since he believes the “forces of improvement are weighing on” Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). Cramer said the Walmart deal was a “kiss of death” for Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). He was referring to Walmart’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Vizio which is expected to increase the already hot competition in the streaming industry.\n\n6. Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWhen asked about Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) in a recent program, Jim Cramer said he would start talking “positively” about robotic process automation stocks if they start making money. But until then, Cramer said, he cannot recommend companies that are not making money. In November last year Cramer had advised investors to not “touch” Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH).\n\nWhile Jim Cramer is bearish on UiPath, he's bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nIn February, Scotia Bank started covering Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) stock with a $29 price target. Scotia Bank’s analysts wrote:\n\n\"We believe PATH is set up to make further inroads into automation budgets and continue its industry leadership, but the opportunities come with challenges, namely a dynamic end-market and rising competition. We are intrigued by PATH’s growth durability and margin progression as it scaled to $1.5B in ARR in short order, but wait for a better entry point before recommending shares.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 38 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH). The most notable stakeholder of Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) during this period was Cathie Wood, which had a $1 billion stake in the company.\n\nPart of the reason why Cathie Wood likes Uipath is AI. The company talked about its AI offerings and future plans in an earnings call in December 2023: [Read the entire earnings call transcript here]\n\n\"We expect Autopilot, which is based on Generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, Document Understanding, and Specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade end-to-end processes automation.

Working with Deloitte, they have created a robust automation program across their organization leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their meter inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date.\n\nWith c-level sponsorship, during the quarter they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey with a goal of saving over $70 million a year. And, we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing or IDP, 2023-2024 Vendor Assessment where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform. Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market leading capabilities with a customer first mindset.

        "title": "Why Meta Platforms, Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Tumbled on Monday",
        "content": "One of the byproducts of the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the investor practice -- for better or for worse -- of viewing AI stocks collectively. In many instances, developments concerning one company in the space can have a ripple effect, bringing a broad cross-section of stocks in the space up or down with them. That appears to be the case Monday morning, as two developments seem to be having on outsize impact on AI companies.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) tumbled 4.1%, social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) slumped 4%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) dropped 3.8%, computer memory specialist Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) declined 3.1%, and semiconductor specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 1.9%, as of 1:32 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up one piece of negative company-specific news -- while surprisingly, there were a number of positive catalysts (more on that in a bit). Furthermore, troubling news about a high-profile company in the space seemed to put AI investors in a dour mood. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA one-two punch\n\nBroadcom released the results of its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Feb. 4) on Friday, and investors weren't particularly impressed. The semiconductor specialist generated revenue of $11.96 billion, an increase of 34% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.99, an increase of 6%.\n\nWhile both metrics exceeded Wall Street's expectations, management's forecast seemed to catch investors off guard. Broadcom reiterated its outlook for the 2024 fiscal year, guiding for revenue of $50 billion. Investors were hoping the company would boost its guidance after exceeding expectations for the quarter. The news weighed on many AI and chip stocks on Friday.\n\nInvestors seemed to be waiting for the other shoe to drop, which happened over the weekend. Reports emerged that a proposed class action lawsuit was filed late on Friday, accusing Nvidia of copyright infringement. Three authors sued the chipmaker, alleging that Nvidia had used their books -- along with hundreds of thousands of others -- to train its NeMo AI platform, and had not requested permission. As one of the undisputed beneficiaries of the adoption of AI, this development will be carefully watched by investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is merely the latest in a growing number of lawsuits filed by writers claiming that copyrighted works have been used to train generative AI systems without their knowledge or consent. Late last year, a group of noteworthy authors -- including George R.R. Martin, Michael Connelly, and Jonathan Franzen -- filed a similar suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, charging that ChatGPT was trained on their copyrighted works. Meta Platforms is in the midst of a similar lawsuit regarding its LLaMA AI model.\n\nWhile these lawsuits are currently having a chilling effect on the development of generative AI, it's too early to tell how these cases will ultimately be decided.\n\nThere's good news\n\nWhile it's understandable that investors might be concerned about these developments, not all the news is bad. In fact, there were some positive bits of company-specific news, and investors appear to be missing the forest for the trees.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nOn Friday, Wells Fargo analysts maintained an overweight (buy) rating on Micron stock while raising their price target to $125, suggesting potential upside of 28% compared to Friday's close. The analysts believe the company is at an inflection point, which will become evident in the next two quarters. AMD also got a price target increase on Friday, courtesy of Melius Research. The analysts maintained a buy rating on AMD stock while raising their price target to $265, suggesting potential upside of 28% compared to Friday's close. They cited AMD's recently released MI300X AI chip as having good prospects in data centers. Broadcom got a pair of price target increases Monday morning. Baird maintained an outperform (buy) rating and raised its price target to $1,500, or upside of 19% compared to Friday's close. Citi analysts also maintained a buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target to $1,560, or 19% upside potential. Both analysts cited the secular tailwinds of AI as a catalyst fueling future growth.\n\nThese announcements suggest that investors should take care in painting all AI stocks with the same brush. While there will no doubt be both positive and negative developments that will impact the entire industry, each of these companies will need to execute on the opportunity and secular tailwinds represented by AI.\n\nMeta Platforms and Taiwan Semiconductor are the least expensive among the group, selling for 32 times and 27 times earnings, respectively. Furthermore, when measured in terms of the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in strong growth -- both stocks clock in at less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nEach of these stocks represents an intriguing opportunity, particularly in light of the opportunity represented by AI, but investors should size their positions based on their risk tolerance and the degree of volatility they're willing to endure.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "20 Highest Paying Countries for Business Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paying countries for business analysts. We have also discussed the demand and importance of business analysts. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Business Analysts.\n\nWhy Are Business Analysts Important?\n\nBy 2025, IDC forecasts a high growth in worldwide data, projecting it to reach a mind-boggling 175 zettabytes, with a 61% increase from the current 33 zettabytes. This exponential increase confirms the monumental challenge of managing such colossal volumes, with data dispersed across three key domains: the core, edge, and endpoints.\n\nIDC's \"Data Age 2025\" report, sponsored by Seagate, highlights the transformative impact of this data explosion. Notably, the storage industry is set to ship 42 zettabytes of capacity within the next seven years, while IoT devices are projected to generate 90 zettabytes of data by 2025. With nearly half of this data expected to reside in public cloud environments and around 30% consumed in real-time, the landscape of data management and utilization is undergoing a seismic shift, demanding innovative solutions to navigate this data deluge.\n\nTherefore, in today’s day and age, business analysts are indispensable to modern enterprises as they navigate the ever-expanding sea of data. In 2024, when decision-making heavily relies on data-driven insights, business analysts serve as the linchpin. They translate complex datasets into actionable information, guiding strategic choices that shape the trajectory of organizations. Despite the abundance of data, the challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights efficiently. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be a crucial ally, empowering analysts to sift through vast datasets rapidly, identify patterns, and predict future trends.\n\nMoreover, AI democratizes data accessibility, enabling non-analytical stakeholders to comprehend insights effectively. By capitalizing on AI, analysts can focus more on strategic analysis rather than mundane tasks, thus maximizing their potential impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, in today's tumultuous retail landscape, the importance of analytics cannot be overstated. Facing challenges like labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the threat of climate change, retailers are turning to data-driven insights for guidance. These analytics come in various forms, from descriptive and diagnostic to predictive and prescriptive, helping retailers understand consumer behavior, manage inventory efficiently, and empower their associates. For instance, by leveraging cloud-based analytics, retailers can optimize inventory placement across hundreds of stores, enhancing sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, innovative approaches like using AI-powered robots to monitor inventory levels offer practical solutions to the supply-and-demand puzzle. Owing to the growing importance of business analysts, it is also one of the highest paying jobs for the future.\n\nTop Skills for Business Analysts to Learn in 2024\n\nIn the 2023, State of Social Media report, we discovered some interetesing findings: 80% of businesses expect a social media budget increase within three years, with 44% predicting a rise of over 50%. 90% emphasize the importance of capitalizing on social data for strategic decision-making. Moreover, 97% recognize the role of AI and ML in efficient data analysis. Leaders are gearing up to harness emerging technologies to maximize social media's impact. As social platforms evolve into indispensable business tools, adept utilization of data and AI has become paramount for competitive advantage. From these stats, we infer that it is high time business analysts learn machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness data-driven insights, predict trends, and optimize business processes. ML and AI empower analysts to extract valuable patterns from vast datasets, enabling informed decision-making and competitive advantage.\n\nTo read more about skills in demand, see the most In Demand Skills for Freelancers.\n\nHighest Paying Companies for Business Analysts\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are two of the highest paying companies for business analysts in 2024 with average annual salaries of $171,988 and $169.015 respectively, according to Glassdoor.com.\n\nSpeaking on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the company’s ascension to the third most valuable US company has confirmed the growing prominence of artificial intelligence in investment circles.

Notably, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s growth trajectory reflects investor optimism, with projected revenue increases of 120% in fiscal 2024 and another 60% in the following year. Moreover, with continued demand for its chips in the AI sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) also remains a top performer in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nOn the other hand, for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), business analysts play a crucial role in understanding user behavior patterns, such as engagement metrics, demographics, and preferences. For instance, they might analyze user interactions with ads to identify which demographics respond most positively, allowing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) to tailor its advertising strategies accordingly. Additionally, business analysts can evaluate the performance of new features or products by tracking user feedback and usage statistics, helping Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) refine its offerings to better meet user needs and preferences.\n\nFurthermore, business analysts at Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are instrumental in identifying emerging trends and opportunities within the digital ecosystem. By analyzing market trends, competitor strategies, and user feedback, they provide valuable insights for product development and innovation.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 30 most spoken languages in the world in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the language services market, you can go to the 5 Most Spoken Languages in the World in 2024.\n\nIn our increasingly interconnected world, communication serves as the bridge that links everyone. An important aspect of effective communication is shared language. Currently, over 7,000 languages are spoken globally, with some being more popular due to the significant portion of the world's population using them. For instance, Mandarin, spoken by over 900 million natives, stands as the most spoken native language, and similarly, Hindi is also among the top 20 most spoken languages in the world in 2024. Languages play an important role in various aspects of life, including career advancement, trade opportunities, education, and travel.\n\nMany individuals choose to diversify their language skills to enhance their career prospects or qualify for more lucrative job opportunities. Numerous companies specialize in language education to facilitate language learning and open new avenues. Popular companies in this space include Coursera Inc. (NYSE:COUR), Duolingo Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The language services industry was valued at $55.13 billion in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $59.41 billion in 2024. This expansion reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8%. The growth is likely to be driven by factors such as globalization, business expansion, social media growth trends, and rising demand for travel and tourism. The launch of AI-based translation tools has also impacted the market, with automated translation services quickly gaining traction. This will be a defining trend as speech and live captioning tools that convert speech to text offer further access to foreign languages. These evolving trends are expected to have implications for the most spoken languages in the world in 2050.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL), one of the top language learning applications in the world, is quickly adapting Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to improve the customization of courses. The company recently launched Duolingo Max, in collaboration with OpenAI, to offer more personalized lessons using AI. This adaptation addresses the increasing demand for machine-based translation in business communications, particularly as the e-commerce and quick commerce sectors require rapid interactions across the globe. The solid financial performance of Duolingo Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL) further highlights its success in meeting the evolving needs of language learners. The company's management provided insights into its performance during the Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n“We had a fantastic year capped off with record bookings and profitability in Q4. We exceeded our bookings forecast in part because of the continued acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter because we saw strength in our family plan throughout the quarter and because we saw better-than-expected performance in our New Year’s promotion. Our continued strength in user and subscriber growth drove bookings and revenue growth of 51% and 45% year-over-year, respectively or 49% and 43% on a constant currency basis.” 30 Most Spoken Languages in the World in 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 30 most spoken languages in the world in 2024, we referred to a number of credible sources such as the Ethnologue and Langoly.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 11, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Constellation Energy Corp. CEG, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Eli Lilly and Co. LLY.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nS&P 500 at New Highs: 4 Best Stocks YTD\n\nThe S&P 500 soared to new all-time highs on reassuring comments regarding potential interest rate declines. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen 8.3% so far this year.\n\nWe have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits so far this year. These are Nvidia Corporation, Constellation Energy Corp., Meta Platforms, Advanced Micro Devices and Eli Lilly and Co..\n\nThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate committee that the central bank is \"not far\" from being confident that inflation is declining toward the 2% target, which would make rate cuts possible. The comment has bolstered investor expectations for the first rate cut in June.\n\nPowell noted that inflation had \"eased substantially\" since hitting a 40-year high in 2022 but that policymakers still needed \"greater confidence\" in its continued decline before cutting rates. He added that there are risks of keeping monetary policy tight for too long and damaging an ongoing economic expansion that has sustained a below 4% unemployment rate for two years.\n\nThe latest bouts of weak data have also raised the bets that the Fed might lower interest rates as soon as June.

        "title": "5 Must-Buy Soaring Tech Giants With More Upside in Near Term",
        "content": "The tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. This theme continues to dominate Wall Street’s investment strategy in 2024. Year to date, out of the 11 sectors of the broad-market index the S&P 500 – technology, and its close resemblance, communication services – have rallied 7.7% and 9.5%, respectively.\n\nThe benchmark itself has advanced 7.4% year to date. Moreover, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has appreciated 8.9% in the same period. Grand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nOther Catalyst\n\nRecently Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his testimony before the Senate after appearing before the House of Representatives a day before. On Mar 6, Powell said the central bank is likely to initiate interest rate cuts this year but not any time soon. However, on Mar 7, he indicated that interest rate cuts may not be too far off if the inflation rate moves in line with the Fed’s expectations in the near future.\n\nPer Powell, “We’re waiting to become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably at 2%. When we do get that confidence, and we’re not far from it, it’ll be appropriate to begin to dial back the level of restriction.”\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows a 74.6% probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in the June FOMC meeting. The interest rate derivative tool also shows at least two more rate cuts of 25-basis points before the end of 2024. A lower interest rate regime will be most beneficial for high-growth sectors like technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths with strong potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 15.3% over the last 30 days. The stock price of NVDA has jumped 76.7% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc.

        "title": "15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.\n\nThe impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment.\n\nIn view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ. 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best ETFs to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and ETF performance, head over to 5 Best ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nIn 2023, US-listed ETF trading declined by 17% to $38 trillion due to record-high interest rates, with money market fund assets reaching an all-time high of $5.9 trillion. However, it was still the second-highest year for ETF volumes on record. iShares ETFs, led by iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE Arca: IWM), iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: HYG), and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ GM: TLT), represented $9.4 trillion of this activity. US equity markets traded nearly $127 trillion, making the US ETFs account for 30% of the total American composite volume in the secondary market in 2023. Meanwhile, US-listed Fixed Income ETFs had their second-largest year on record at $5.8 trillion, slightly behind the 2022 figures. Also, options trading in the US-listed ETFs reached record levels in 2023, with the industry totaling $130 trillion, up 24% year-over-year.\n\nThe ETF industry set a new record with 543 new ETFs launched in 2023, surpassing the previous record of just under 480 in 2021 by more than 60 funds. Approximately 75% of the newly launched funds in 2023 were actively managed. According to VettaFi’s Dave Nadig:\n\n“It was only a few years ago when we crossed 2,000 ETFs listed that the first ‘there are too many ETFs!’ complaints started up, and yet here we are. But the reality is there’s no cap on innovation. The products we’ve seen gain traction this year — the rise of active products, the narrow slices of the  market, options overlays, buffers, conversions — they weren’t really even a pipe dream five years ago, and they’re the stories of the year. ETFs have gained so much ground because they solve real problems for real investors.”\n\nLately, retail traders are increasingly utilizing exchange traded funds as a new tool during the recent Bitcoin rally. Newly launched funds, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ GM: IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (CBOE US: FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE US: ARKB) have experienced a surge in trading volume. For instance, IBIT traded about 96 million shares on February 28, more than double its previous record, indicating significant retail interest. The Fidelity and ARK funds also saw substantial increases in shares traded, surpassing earlier records. The active market suggests that retail traders are leveraging these ETFs to participate in the Bitcoin rally, with the cryptocurrency crossing $60,000 for the first time since November 2021. Despite Bitcoin's 30% rise since the ETFs were approved, their prices have consistently increased over the past six weeks, contributing to the notable trading volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best ETFs expose investors to stocks like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

The majority of Fabrinet’s sales are to optical communications equipment manufacturers, but it has been successfully diversifying into the data center, industrial, auto, and medical end-markets. FN’s stock jumped after reporting June 2023 earnings – data center sales increased 50% sequentially and more than 100% over the previous year, driven by their 800-gigabyte transceivers for Artificial Intelligence applications. The company also announced that Nvidia is a 10%+ customer.\n\nFabrinet was, notably, a top-five holding in the Fund before its June earnings announcement and, although we have trimmed our position, was our largest holding at the end of 2023. While we continue to evaluate what we believe is a positive incremental change in the company’s earnings power, we are seeking to take some profits in keeping with our risk management policies.”\n\n13.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”\n\n11. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE Arca: DGRO)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 53.66%\n\niShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE Arca: DGRO) aims to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, which is composed of US equities with a track record of consistent dividend growth.

We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses.

Given the large amount of revenue associated with drugs going off-patent, the new product portfolio was key to the company’s ability to change investor perception. Certain launches are not performing as expected, and others are taking longer to scale. Additionally, Bristol-Myers reduced medium-term operating margin guidance to invest in its commercial drugs and the research and development (R&D) pipeline. We do not believe that the company exhibited the level of defensiveness in the strategy we expected given the low valuation.”\n\n8.

The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices. Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates, driven in large part to growing Al demand. Regarding Intelligent Cloud segment, management noted Azure optimizations were similar to the previous quarter, but new Al and traditional workloads are helping drive greater consumption growth, which resulted in their first reacceleration since March 2022. We believe the strong Azure performance suggests diminishing cost optimization headwinds and growing strength in Al service consumption.”\n\n7. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE Arca: SPY)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 81.91%\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE Arca: SPY) aims to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 Index.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), which saw significant price appreciation throughout much of 2023, saw its share price increase materially in Q4 following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings report. We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures. Our position in Amazon reflects our positive long-term expectations of the business, and it is currently our largest absolute weight in the Portfolio.”\n\n6. iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 92.94%\n\niShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 100 Index, which consists of 100 large-cap US equities.

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

Amazon's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global No. 1 cloud infrastructure service platform. Alphabet's Google had a monopoly like 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure. Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.\n\nForget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 stock split. Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split. Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split. Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nGiven that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.\n\nFor example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.\n\nWhat's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.\n\nAdd in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.\n\nInstead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.\n\nAlthough Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.\n\nThe company's social media \"real estate\" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.\n\nWhat all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.\n\nAnd unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.\n\nMicrosoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.\n\nIn terms of \"high-growth initiatives,\" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.\n\nMicrosoft's AI ambitions are also on display. It's invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, incorporated AI solutions into search engine Bing, and plans to lean on various generative AI solutions to assist businesses with document processing and conversational AI on the Azure platform.\n\nLastly, Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies that sports the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft's legacy operations and cloud services wouldn't miss a beat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Cue bubble warnings on Wall and Broad.\n\nThe market’s relentless rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 25% from its October lows, fueled by gains in only a handful of stocks.\n\nLeading the charge is AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker has gained more than 80% since the start of the year, helping drive the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to record levels.\n\nThe concentrated outperformance has prompted some on Wall Street to warn the rally has gone too far and declare stocks are in bubble territory.\n\nMarket concentration has surged to a multi-decade high. The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of the S&P 500 market cap and 25% of S&P 500 earnings, according to Goldman Sachs data.\n\nBut concerns over narrow market participation and frothiness may be misguided. In the last week, several top Wall Street strategists made it clear on Yahoo Finance’s \"Morning Brief\" that there’s reason to believe the market will keep going up.\n\n\"This might be the best sell-side trick out there right now. … I don't think that's justified,\" Citi US equity strategy director Drew Pettit said of the bubble fear on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It’s actually a lot healthier than people are giving it credit for.\"\n\nStrong quarterly results from Big Tech have bolstered the bull case. Nvidia posted another blowout quarter thanks to surging AI demand, while Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) topped expectations.\n\nHigher profit margins and proven returns are two reasons Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes the current market environment as a \"1995 moment\" rather than comparing it to the start of the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"This is nowhere near the 1999/2000 period in our view as the sky high valuations, lack of monetization/ infrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models, and macro backdrop was in a totally different world back then compared to what we see today,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nCiti's head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely echoed Ives’s bullish view on tech, telling Yahoo Finance he \"doesn’t see any end in sight.\"\n\n\"We've got a long way to go until we're going to start ringing the alarm bells or even hear a tinkling of bells,\" Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBeyond tech and beneath the surface, underlying trends are positive. Market breadth — an indication of bullish sentiment — has slowly started to improve. The S&P 500 equal weight index (^SPXEW) and small caps outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\n\"The broadening out we’re seeing is happening in a stealthy way,\" Charles Schwab’s Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance, adding that churn under the surface is \"not a bad thing.\"\n\nAnd, it’s important to note, history says elevated concentration isn’t necessarily indicative of a market top. Goldman Sachs analyzed market concentrations spanning the past 100 years and found the S&P 500 rallied more often than not following past concentration peaks.\n\n\"One consistent pattern around periods of elevated concentration is large swings in Momentum,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. \"While the performance of the high Momentum leaders was inconsistent, the previous laggards appreciated in absolute terms in every episode. This supports our view that a \"catch up\" by laggards is more likely to interrupt the ongoing Momentum rally than a 'catch down' by the recent market leaders.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Citi strategy director Drew Pettit.

        "title": "A Third \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.\n\nAlphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.\n\nWatching where a stock has been\n\nThe 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.\n\nFor example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign. NVDA Chart\n\nThe 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock. GOOGL Chart\n\nNotice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.\n\nIn the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.\n\nUnderstanding market sentiment\n\nA great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.\n\nIf you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.\n\nAnother recent example is Target(NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.\n\nIn sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.\n\nUsing moving averages to your advantage\n\nThe best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.\n\nIn other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.\n\nIt happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.\n\nThe point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.\n\nWhat the Alphabet sell-off tells us\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.\n\nApple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.\n\nThe market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).\n\nThe market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.\n\nAlphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Repeats story moved on Friday without change to text)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.

        "title": "Stock bubble fears are overblown despite Magnificent 7's rally: Wall Street analysts",
        "content": "The market’s relentless rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 25% from its October lows, fueled by gains in only a handful of stocks.\n\nLeading the charge is AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker has gained more than 80% since the start of the year, helping drive the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to record levels.\n\nThe concentrated outperformance has prompted some on Wall Street to warn the rally has gone too far and declare stocks are in bubble territory.\n\nMarket concentration has surged to a multi-decade high. The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of S&P 500 market cap and 25% of S&P 500 earnings, according to Goldman Sachs data.\n\nBut concerns over narrow market participation and frothiness may be misguided. Several top Wall Street strategists made it clear on Yahoo Finance’s \"Morning Brief\" last week that there’s reason to believe the market will keep going up.\n\n\"This might be the best sell side trick out there right now… I don't think that's justified,\" Citi US Equity Strategy Director Drew Petit said of the bubble fear on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It’s actually a lot healthier than people are giving it credit for.\"\n\nStrong quarterly results from big tech have bolstered the bull case. Nvidia posted another blow out quarter thanks to surging AI demand, while Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) topped expectations.\n\nHigher profit margins and proven returns are two reasons Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes the current market environment as a \"1995 moment\" rather than comparing it to the start of the dotcom bubble.\n\n\"This is nowhere near the 1999/2000 period in our view as the sky high valuations, lack of monetization/ infrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models, and macro backdrop was in a totally different world back then compared to what we see today,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nCiti's head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely echoed Ives’s bullish view on tech, telling Yahoo Finance he \"doesn’t see any end in sight.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've got a long way to go until we're going to start ringing the alarm bells or even hear a tinkling of bells,\" Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBeyond tech and beneath the surface, underlying trends are positive. Market breadth — an indication of bullish sentiment — has slowly started to improve. The S&P 500 equal weight index (SPXEW) and small caps outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\n\"The broadening out we’re seeing is happening in a stealthy way,\" Charles Schwab’s Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance, adding that churn under the surface is \"not a bad thing.\"\n\nAnd, it’s important to note, history says elevated concentration isn’t necessarily indicative of a market top. Goldman Sachs analyzed market concentrations spanning the past 100 years, and found the S&P 500 rallied more often than not following past concentration peaks.\n\n\"One consistent pattern around periods of elevated concentration is large swings in Momentum,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. \"While the performance of the high Momentum leaders was inconsistent, the previous laggards appreciated in absolute terms in every episode. This supports our view that a \"catch up\" by laggards is more likely to interrupt the ongoing Momentum rally than a 'catch down' by the recent market leaders.\"\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Meet the 5 Stocks That Have Contributed Almost All of the S&amp;P 500's 2024 Gains",
        "content": "Containing the 500 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies by market cap, the S&P 500 is arguably the best indicator of the performance of the overall U.S. stock market. At least, it has been in the past.\n\nBut something is happening that's making the index's performance somewhat misleading. As of March 6, the S&P 500 has gained 7.0% year to date. But 6.5 percentage points of that gain are due to the performance of just five companies.\n\nYou may be wondering how this is possible, given the index is so massive. Are the other 495 companies really putting up mediocre results?\n\nLet's look at these growth stocks, their impact on the market, and what it means for your portfolio (whether or not you're invested in them). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2024 market leaders\n\nThe following table showcases why huge gains from overweighted components of the S&P 500 can move the whole index.\n\nCompany YTD Gain Weight in S&P 500 Percentage Point Contribution to S&P 500 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 79.2% 5.0% 3.9% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 40.2% 2.6% 1.0% Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) 14.2% 3.7% 0.5% Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) 33.8% 1.5% 0.5% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 6.6% 7.0% 0.5%\n\nData sources: Slickcharts and YCharts as of Mar. 6, 2024. YTD = year to date.\n\nNvidia and Meta Platforms alone are responsible for over half of this year's gains for the index. Microsoft is another interesting case; as the highest-weighted component of the S&P 500 (yes, even more than Apple), it doesn't take a big move for it to affect the index. Drugmaker Eli Lilly makes up just 1.5% of the S&P 500, but it's strong rally this year has been enough to move the index half a percentage point higher.\n\nCombined, these five companies make up 19.7% of the S&P 500. A little math tells us that, on average, the other 495 companies have gained just 0.7% this year (adjusted for their weightings in the index).\n\nDissecting the S&P 500's moves\n\nThere are a few ways to unpack this information. The obvious takeaway is that the market's roaring start really is due to a handful of companies. But a more subtle realization is that the market will have difficulty sustaining these gains from these leading constituents.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have put up big numbers. The story has carried over into 2024, but it may soon begin to run out of steam through no fault of these five companies. Data by YCharts.\n\nAs we've seen repeatedly in past market cycles, valuations can only expand so much before fundamentals must catch up. The good news is that earnings from this cohort are growing. Nvidia is arguably the best example.\n\nOn the surface, its 74.4 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio looks sky-high, but analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to roughly double over the next year, so its forward P/E ratio is a much more reasonable 36.1. In fact, it's on par with Microsoft while coming in lower than Tesla, Amazon, and Eli Lilly.\n\nGrowth can make rapid run-ups in stock prices justifiable. It's just that the faster and higher stock prices run, especially when they have this level of impact on the broader market, the more stretched the market becomes and the more room there is for a sell-off.\n\nThe path forward\n\n2023 and 2024 have been fascinating years in the market. The highest-weighted companies are also some of the market's top gainers -- concentrating the gains of the overall index in just a few companies.\n\nIt doesn't matter where the gains come from if you own an S&P 500 index fund, but if you don't own these companies, your returns may vary wildly from the broad market's. The tech sector alone makes up 29.5% of the index. In fact, it's the only sector to have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years. So, if you didn't own tech or the market's top movers outside of tech, it would have been challenging to beat the market during this period.\n\nNo one knows what will happen over the next five years, but we do know what has driven the market over the last five. Market dynamics can help you understand what's happening in the short term -- the trick is to not lose sight of what really matters, which is achieving your financial goals.\n\nHitching a ride on a hot trend to make a quick buck is a common way to lose money. A better approach is to focus on a long-term investment thesis and compounding wealth over time. The real gains in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have come to those who have held the stocks for five years, a decade, or even longer. The road hasn't been easy as most of these companies have endured brutal sell-offs, most recently in 2022's bear market.\n\nIf you want to invest in growth but don't know where to start, there are plenty of inexpensive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worth checking out that achieve diversification and the benefits of a hands-off approach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Most Likely to Deliver a 5X Gain by 2030: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You won't have to look hard to find well-known stocks that have been multi-baggers in recent years. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) share price has more than quadrupled since 2014. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up more than 9x during the same period. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered a gain of over 10x. Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has soared 7x. Then there's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with its share price skyrocketing in the ballpark of 19,400%.\n\nBut those impressive returns are now history. Which of these stocks is likely to deliver a 5x gain by 2030?\n\nStrong growth prospects all around\n\nI think all five of these stocks should have strong growth prospects going forward. They share a common tailwind that's likely to blow hard for years to come -- artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud are poised for tremendous growth, in my view, as IT spending shifts from on-premises to the cloud. The scramble to build AI functionality should accelerate this trend. Nvidia will almost certainly be a direct beneficiary of this migration. The company's GPUs remain the favorite chip for powering AI apps.\n\nMeta isn't a cloud provider or a chipmaker. However, the company's open-source approach to developing AI could pay off nicely over the long term. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks that the benefits of this strategy include increased AI safety and security, a greater ability to integrate new AI innovations into Meta's products, and a competitive advantage in hiring the best developers and researchers.\n\nAI isn't the only growth driver for these five stocks, though. Amazon still has plenty of room to run in the e-commerce market and other areas it's expanding into, including healthcare. Microsoft's opportunities include gaming, especially with the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Alphabet has its famous \"other bets,\" such as healthcare-focused Calico and Verily. Meta is investing heavily in developing the metaverse. Nvidia's initial success came from powering gaming apps, and it still represents a major growth market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNarrowing the list\n\nI like all of these stocks. I think all of them could deliver solid long-term returns. But we must narrow the list to pick a winner.\n\nWhich is the first to be eliminated? My pick is Meta. The company won't profit as directly from AI as the three cloud service providers or Nvidia. Meta's big bet on the metaverse might not pay off by 2030 (or possibly ever). Its social media platforms, while continuing to dominate, don't have as much growth potential as they have in the past.\n\nNext on the chopping block for me is Amazon. E-commerce remains the company's biggest revenue source. As mentioned previously, it's still a growth opportunity for Amazon. However, that opportunity isn't as great as the ones that other companies on our list have. This could make it more challenging for Amazon stock to soar by 5x by 2030.\n\nI'm going to reluctantly strike Microsoft off the list as well. My primary determining factor here is valuation. Microsoft's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on Wall Street's consensus five-year growth projections is over 2x, the highest multiple of all of these stocks except Amazon. Granted, those growth projections could be overly pessimistic. Still, I suspect that it would be more difficult for Microsoft stock to increase by 5x going forward because of its starting valuation.\n\nThe finalists\n\nThat leaves two finalists -- Alphabet and Nvidia. Choosing between them is tough.\n\nIn addition to continued growth with its current apps and Google Cloud, Alphabet could have a massive growth driver with its Waymo self-driving car business. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest predicts that the robotaxi market could be worth $9 trillion by 2030. Waymo is likely to be a leader in that market. Google also ranks as a top innovator in quantum computing technology, which could be another game-changer.\n\nAlphabet does face some risks, though. Ark Invest's robotaxi market prediction could be way too optimistic. It could take much longer to achieve the potential for quantum computing than anyone expects. AI-powered virtual assistants could dampen Google Search's growth down the road. Alphabet's \"other bets\" could be disappointing.\n\nWhat about Nvidia? It's arguably the most important company in the world right now. Every other company on our list (plus thousands of others) relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang thinks that the shift to accelerated computing and generative AI \"will drive a doubling of the world's data-center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\" If he's right, Nvidia could realistically deliver a 5x return by 2030.\n\nOn the other hand, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran believes that Nvidia is the most overvalued \"Magnificent Seven\" stock by far, even factoring in strong growth projections. The company also faces increased competition in the AI chip market, which could grow even stronger over the next few years.\n\nMost likely to deliver a 5x gain\n\nSo which stock is most likely to deliver a 5x gain? I'm going to give the nod to Nvidia. The company should profit from pretty much every technology growth market around -- AI, gaming, self-driving cars, the metaverse, and more. That said, I don't think becoming a five-bagger again will be easy for Nvidia (because of the challenges I've already mentioned).\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway from this hypothetical exercise is that all of these stocks could make investors plenty of money over the long run. I don't think you'd go wrong with buying Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia as long as you hold onto the stocks long enough.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an \"AI cold shower,\" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.\n\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.\n\nOn February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.\n\nSome of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions. The company is also leveraging its single data store and AI capabilities to cross-sell more products into its existing customer base and increase average sale prices. Between larger deal sizes and improving operating efficiencies, we believe the company can continue to expand margins at a significant rate and begin generating positive free cash flow in the next fiscal year.”\n\n11.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch. One outlier right now is Nvidia which is capturing 80% margins..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6. Robo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSE:THNQ)\n\nYTD Share Price Gain as of March 8: 12.02%\n\nRobo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSE:THNQ) ranks 6th on our list of the best AI ETFs.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Since stocks began trading on the Nasdaq roughly 50 years ago, the index has only produced negative annual returns 14 times. Over the last 20 years, the index has dropped by at least 30% on three occasions: 2002, 2008, and 2022.\n\nInterestingly, following the precipitous declines of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq rallied for consecutive years thereafter. Between 2003 and 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 16% per year. And in 2009 and 2010, the index produced average returns of 30%.\n\nAfter its painful performance in 2022, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply in 2023, returning 43%. It's safe to say that the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) largely influenced the upswing in tech stocks.\n\nBut 2024 is off to a red-hot start, and further gains could be in store for investors. While each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks below experienced AI-driven momentum last year, I think all of them still look enticing at the moment.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations. The last few years have been brutal for Amazon. Unusually high inflation coupled with the rising interest rates that reined in that inflation have squeezed Amazon's core businesses. Consumers have scaled back their discretionary spending, putting a strain on Amazon's e-commerce efforts. In addition, as companies tightened their budgets, its software businesses witnessed a pronounced growth deceleration. This dynamic can be seen in the ebbs and flows of Amazon's revenue and free cash flow generation below. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut throughout 2023, Amazon made a series of savvy moves that could help reignite its growth. Among them, the company invested billions into OpenAI competitor Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be training future generative AI models on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nInvestors should not overlook the impact AI can have on Amazon. The technology should not only help fuel some renewed interest in AWS, but also integrate into Amazon's e-commerce, streaming, logistics, and advertising businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1 looks like a bargain compared to its historical levels. Now could be a great opportunity to scoop up shares of this under-the-radar AI player.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) kicked off the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Since pouring billions into the start-up, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT across the Windows operating system.\n\nSimilar to Amazon, Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carries some of the most lucrative growth prospects for the company as it relates to AI. The one concern I have about Microsoft is its valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35.5, Microsoft trades at a premium compared to most of its Magnificent Seven peers. While it's reasonable to believe that the expected impacts of AI are baked into Microsoft's price, perhaps more than some of its peers, I don't think the stock is egregiously overvalued.\n\nClearly, investors are placing a premium on the biggest names in AI -- and Microsoft is no exception. Given that AI is in its early innings, I see Microsoft as well-positioned to dominate in the long run. Despite its premium valuation, now could still be a good time to use dollar-cost averaging to add some shares to your portfolio.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) owns two of the world's most visited websites: Google and YouTube. Given Alphabet's commanding surface area on the Internet, it's not a surprise to learn that advertisers are keen to be seen on its platforms.\n\nBut although advertising has long been Alphabet's primary revenue and profit machine, the company is in the midst of an identity crisis. Social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook have become increasingly popular over the last few years -- especially among highly coveted demographics, including Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAs such, growth in Alphabet's advertising business has started to plateau, investor enthusiasm is starting to wane, and Alphabet stock is taking a hit. On a price-to-sales basis, Alphabet is the second cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nNevertheless, I still see many reasons to own Alphabet stock. First, the company is quickly gaining momentum in the cloud computing landscape. What's even better is that its cloud segment is generating positive operating income on a consistent basis, mitigating some of the deceleration in the core advertising business.\n\nMoreover, the cloud is really where Alphabet is focusing its artificial intelligence efforts. So, even though the advertising business is currently facing some challenges, investors can actually buy Alphabet's AI business at a pretty steep discount.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) owns social media apps Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Additionally, the company has a budding metaverse operation via its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) hardware products.\n\nThe last couple of years have been tough for Meta, however. The company pivoted to an all-in approach to the metaverse a couple of years ago. While this was initially met with praise, investors quickly soured on the company after a series of poor earnings reports that featured decelerating growth in the core advertising business and mounting losses.\n\nMeta spent much of 2023 turning things around and shifting its focus back to its bread-and-butter businesses. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith sales and free cash flow on the rise, Meta appears to have climbed its way out of a hole. What's even better is that in the wake of this newfound growth, Meta has found ample ways to reward shareholders. Following its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this year, Meta announced a $50 billion share repurchase and the initiation of a quarterly dividend.\n\nGiven that artificial intelligence can significantly impact both Meta's advertising and metaverse businesses, the long-term ride could just be getting started for the social media conglomerate.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nLast on the list is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a developer of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Make no mistake about it -- the AI narrative largely hinges on Nvidia. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are in high demand as generative AI takes the world by storm.\n\nThe most lucrative thing about Nvidia is that AI touches nearly every aspect of its business -- from data centers to software development and more. What I find most attractive about Nvidia is that it's aggressively deploying its ever-growing profits. The company recently invested in two budding areas of AI: voice-recognition software and robotics. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nWhile the company's market cap has grown by $1 trillion in less than a year, I think the momentum can easily continue. Considering that its outlook is robust for the next several years, Nvidia's valuation seems warranted. Now could be a great time to buy some shares to hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Awe-Inspiring Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Putting your money to work on Wall Street is bound to come with its highs and lows. In successive years since the decade began, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets, with the growth-stock-powered Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) vacillating the most.\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite brought up the caboose. It lost 33% of its value, which represented a notably worse performance than the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. But since the start of 2023, the Nasdaq has been leading the charge. It's up more than 55% in a little over 14 months and recently took out its previous record high, which was set in November 2021. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut don't think for a moment that, just because the Nasdaq Composite is breaking records, deals can't still be found. With the \"Magnificent Seven\" doing most of the heavy lifting, bargains among growth stocks can still be uncovered for opportunistic long-term investors.\n\nWhat follows are four awe-inspiring growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nVisa\n\nThe first magnificent growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not adding to your portfolio, even with the Nasdaq taking out new highs, is payment-processing company Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nAll companies face headwinds -- even industry leaders like Visa. The \"enemy\" of financial stocks is recessions. Financial companies are cyclical and usually rely on economic growth to expand their bottom lines. If select money-based metrics and predictive indicators are accurate, the U.S. economy could dip into a recession later this year, which would almost certainly curb spending and reduce the number of aggregate transactions by consumers and businesses.\n\nHowever, it makes a lot of statistical sense to remain optimistic about the U.S. economy. Whereas three-quarters of all recessions since 1945 have resolved in under a year, the bulk of expansions over the same stretch have stuck around for multiple years, if not a full decade. Businesses like Visa are ideally positioned to take advantage of the natural expansion of the U.S. and global economy over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a more company-specific level, Visa is the undisputed leader in credit card network purchase volume in the United States. It holds a nearly 42% share and was the only one of the major payment processors to enjoy significant share expansion following the Great Recession.\n\nFurthermore, it has a lengthy runway to expand its payment infrastructure into overseas markets. Africa, Southeastern Asia, and the Middle East remain largely underbanked, and cross-border volume has been Visa's fastest source of consistent payment growth.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle for Visa is that it's strictly remained a payment processor. During recessions, lending institutions have to set aside capital to cover loan delinquencies and potential loan losses. Since Visa doesn't lend, it has superior financial flexibility and few profit margin headwinds.\n\nLovesac\n\nA second awe-inspiring growth stock you'll regret not scooping up with the Nasdaq in a relatively young bull market is furniture company Lovesac(NASDAQ: LOVE). Yes, I did just use \"furniture company\" and \"growth stock\" in the same sentence.\n\nGenerally speaking, the furniture industry is slow-growing, highly cyclical, and dependent on foot traffic into brick-and-mortar stores. It's an industry that's been ripe for disruption for a long time... and Lovesac has answered the call.\n\nThe most front-and-center differentiating factor for Lovesac is its furniture. Nearly 90% of the company's net sales trace back to its \"sactionals\" -- modular couches that can be rearranged dozens of ways to fit most living spaces. The yarn used in sactionals is made from recycled plastic water bottles, which speaks to the eco-friendliness of the product. Meanwhile, sactionals have more than 200 different cover choices, which ensures they'll match the color or theme of any room.\n\nIn addition to functionality, optionality, and eco-friendliness, Lovesac's price points provide a competitive edge. With the ability to add wireless charging and surround sound, sactionals tend to be pricier than traditional sectional couches. But this is precisely what management wants. Lovesac's targeted customer tends to have a higher income, and is therefore less likely to alter their spending habits during periods of minor economic disruption.\n\nLovesac's omnichannel sales platform is another reason for its success. Though it does have physical stores in 40 states, the company leans on its online presence, popup showrooms, and select brand-name partnerships to keep its inventory levels under control and lower its overhead expenses. The result has been superior margins among furniture stocks.\n\nLovesac looks to be a steal at 10 times forward-year earnings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIntel\n\nThe third striking growth stock you'll wish you'd purchased during the early stages of the Nasdaq bull market is semiconductor stock Intel(NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nIf there's a knock against Intel, it's the company's historic reliance on legacy central processing units (CPUs). With seemingly every investor focused on artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment, the slower growth rates and highly cyclical sales trajectory of CPUs in personal computers (PCs) has dragged on the performance of Intel's stock.\n\nOn the other hand, Intel's legacy segments are still cash cows. Even after losing some of its CPU market share in data centers and PCs to chief rival Advanced Micro Devices, Intel remains the dominant provider of CPUs for PCs. The cash Intel generates from these segments can be reinvested in higher-growth initiatives for the company.\n\nOne of these intriguing opportunities happens to be in AI. Intel unveiled its Gaudi3 AI chip in December, with the goal of rolling it out to customers in 2024. Gaudi3 will compete with Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), which is used in AI-accelerated data centers to power generative AI software.\n\nIntel is also diversifying its revenue stream by meaningfully expanding its foundry services segment. It plans to open two chip fabrication plants in Ohio by 2026 or 2027, as well as one in Germany in the latter half of the decade. By 2030, Intel could grow into the world's No. 2 foundry.\n\nDespite being a stalwart among chipmakers, Intel is most definitely a growth stock. Between 2023 and 2027, earnings per share is expected to catapult from a reported $1.05 to an estimated $4.44.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nA fourth awe-inspiring growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than social media titan Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nSimilar to Visa, recessions tend to be Meta's biggest concern. Last year, nearly 98% of its $134.9 billion in total sales could be traced back to advertising. It's common for businesses to reduce their ad spending when the U.S. economy weakens or offers hints of weakness to come. Thankfully, periods of economic expansion last substantially longer than recessions, which allows ad-driven businesses to thrive.\n\nMeta's foundational operating segment is its basket of leading social media sites. Facebook is the world's most visited social destination, with 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs). Adding in other highly popular sites, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads, Meta's family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion MAUs during the December-ended quarter. Since Meta provides businesses with access to more eyeballs than any other social platform, it's often able to command strong ad-pricing power.\n\nAnother reason investors can be confident about Meta Platforms' future is its superior cash position and cash flow. The company closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which comes atop the $71.1 billion generated in net cash from operating activities for the year. Meta's cash-cow advertising platform allows the company to take risks that few other companies can afford to.\n\nOne of the growth initiatives CEO Mark Zuckerberg is especially excited about is the development of augmented/virtual reality devices, as well as supporting almost anything to do with the metaverse. Though Meta's Reality Labs segment is losing money hand over fist, Zuckerberg is positioning his company to be an on ramp to 3D virtual environments by the latter half of the decade.\n\nLast but not least, Meta Platforms is still cheap. Despite more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares can be purchased for less than 14 times forward-year cash flow, which represents a modest discount from the company's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds comment by former vice president Pence, Republican senator, paragraphs 6, 9-10)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump raised concerns about banning TikTok ahead of a vote next week by the U.S. House of Representatives that would give TikTok owner ByteDance about six months to divest the popular short video app.\n\nThe former Republican president said: \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook ... will double their business,\" and added he does not want Facebook \"doing better.\"\n\nTrump, who is seeking a return to the White House, made the comments in a social media post on Truth Social late on Thursday.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately comment on whether he has a position on the legislation. Facebook parent Meta Platforms declined to comment.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday approved legislation on a 50-0 vote to crack down on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users.\n\nMike Pence, who served as vice president under Trump, endorsed the proposed House legislation on TikTok. \"China is poisoning the minds of American children. Enough is enough,\" he wrote on social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok; if it did not, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabet's Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide Web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.\n\nIn 2020, Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, who previously blocked attempts to fast-track a TikTok ban, responded to Trump's statement that said the former president helped address concerns about U.S. users of TikTok through a $1.5 billion company project.\n\n\"So why is the House GOP siding with (President Joe) Biden and still trying to ban Tik Tok?\" Paul wrote on X, using an acronym for Republicans. \"If Congress bans TikTok, they will be acting just like the Chinese communists who have also banned TikTok ... Why not just defend the first amendment?\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump said in an August 2020 executive order that TikTok data collection \"threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\"\n\nTikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban. It is unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok it could be divested in six months.\n\n\"This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,\" the company said after the Energy and Commerce Committee vote. \"The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.\"\n\nThe app is popular and getting legislation approved by both the House and Senate in an election year may be difficult. Last month, Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok.\n\nTrump's campaign has not joined TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - As the world's biggest tech companies revamp their core online services to comply with the European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act, the changes could give some smaller rivals and even peers a competitive edge.\n\nThe DMA is Europe's attempt to rein in Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft and create a level playing field for smaller rivals and ultimately more competition for Europeans.\n\nThe sweeping legislation compels some of the world's biggest tech companies to make it easier for consumers to pick and choose services from different providers.\n\n\"The winners will be small European businesses which will get more options and more visibility than large companies,\" said Christophe Carugati at advisory firm Digital Competition.\n\nFor example, Meta has to make its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services interoperable with eligible rivals, as long as they meet the company's technical and security standards.\n\nIn practice, this means users of other messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram – which have gained traction internationally for their emphasis on protecting user privacy – could soon be able to chat with Messenger and Whatsapp contacts without switching apps.\n\nMeta says in its compliance report it is striking a balance between creating a viable approach for the third-party providers interested in becoming interoperable with Meta while maximizing user security, safety, and privacy.\n\nSimilarly, users of Google's Android phones will be guaranteed a choice of default search engine when setting up their device, representing a big opportunity for alternatives such as privacy-focused DuckDuckGo and environment-conscious Ecosia.\n\n\"The implementation of these new rules is a step in the right direction, but the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and whether we see any meaningful changes in market share,\" Sophie Dembinski, public policy chief at Ecosia, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said in a blog this week said changes to search results mean large intermediaries and aggregators would get more traffic while hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants would get less.\n\nConsumers in the EU have also won new privacy protections, as the DMA introduces new rules on how these companies use their data.\n\nFor example, users can disentangle their Facebook and Instagram accounts, so information will no longer be shared across platforms for tracking and targeting purposes.\n\nAPP STORE WARS\n\nWhile the DMA offers new avenues for smaller rivals to access consumers, the incumbent tech giants could also see their peers take a bite of their market shares.\n\nApple arguably stands to lose the most from the DMA, which forces it to open up its lucrative App Store, an opportunity that Big Tech competitors and smaller start-ups alike will likely pounce on.\n\nUnder the DMA, Apple will have to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the EU outside of its own App Store.\n\nApple has warned that changes to its iOS mobile operating system, Safari web browser, and the App Store bring greater risks to users and developers as it could include new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats.\n\nApple's critics say it is only interested in defending its profits since it receives a 30% commission on in-app purchases.\n\nThe implementation of the new rules comes amid an escalation of a row between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games, one of its longstanding critics.\n\nFortnite had planned to launch its own app store on iPhones and iPads in the EU, as per the DMA. But, on Wednesday, Apple terminated a new developer account that Epic had created in Sweden. In response, Epic accused Apple of removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Commission has asked Apple for an explanation and sees the issue as a priority, which could become a test case for the new rules.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Martin Coulter; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alison Williams)",

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump raised concerns about banning TikTok ahead of a vote next week by the U.S. House of Representatives that would give TikTok owner ByteDance about six months to divest the popular short video app.\n\nThe former Republican president seeking a return to the White House wrote late Thursday on social media site Truth Social \"if you get rid of TikTok, Facebook... will double their business,\" and added he does not want Facebook \"doing better.\"\n\nThe campaign did not immediately comment on whether Trump has a position on the legislation. Facebook parent Meta declined to comment.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday approved legislation on a 50-0 vote to crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users.\n\nThe bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok; if it did not, app stores operated by Apple, Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.\n\nIn 2020, Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.\n\nTrump said in an August 2020 executive order that TikTok data collection \"threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\"\n\nTikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban and it is not clear if China would approve any sale, or that it could be divested in six months.\n\n\"This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,\" the company said after the vote. \"The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe app is popular and getting legislation approved by both the House and Senate in an election year may be difficult. Last month, Democratic President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok.\n\nTrump's campaign has not joined TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",

        "title": "10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January &amp; February 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best performing growth stocks in January 2024. If you want to skip our overview of growth stocks and the stock market climate, then you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January and February 2024.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in stocks, the choice of the shares can depend on investment objectives and risk appetite. While people invest for a variety of reasons, the two main ones are a need to protect their capital against inflation and the desire to watch it grow in value. Depending on either of these, one can pile money either into growth stocks or in value stocks.\n\nAs the title suggests, growth stocks belong to those companies that are expected to grow their revenue and profitability in the future. This translated into hefty share prices, and one key way in which investors determine whether a stock is a growth stock is its price to earnings ratio. This ratio divides the current share price with the earnings per share to see the premium that the market is paying over a stock's ability to earn money through EPS.\n\nNaturally, since their share prices are based on investor expectations instead of current financial performance, growth stocks are also riskier than value stocks. There are a couple of reasons behind this risk. The first is a sentiment driven share price driven by valuation models to an extent. While models such as discounted cash flows (DCF) provide a nice way to value a firm's future cash flows today, they still carry the risk of reality not matching the model and the shares adjusting to reflect this.\n\nAdditionally, growth isn't cheap and while we'll get to this later, since growth stocks rely on investor optimism about the future, they carry the risk of losing their value in case the economic clouds darken. A robust economy helped by consistent growth is a key determinant of growth stock performance, and this has also been the case throughout 2022 and 2023. The two years have proven to be among the most tumultuous in recent stock market history, and they've seen growth stocks tumble and then surge as a reflection of investor expectations for the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, one last important factor to keep in mind when looking at growth stocks is interest rates. These set the tone for the business climate, and for growth stocks, it means that they find it easier to finance their expansion if the rates are low. If you've been regularly following Insider Monkey or the financial media in general, you'd know that interest rates remain the hottest topic on Wall Street.\n\nOn this front, the tail end of February 2024 provided investors with a crucial data set to determine the future path of interest rates. Right now rates are quite high as the Federal Reserve is determined to stamp out inflation. Even as inflation remains above the Fed's benchmark, the fact that it has dropped noticeably over the past year or so has provided investors, and particularly those who like growth stocks, with hope that the first cuts will start soon.\n\nTherefore, with inflation tied to interest rates, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index data for January 2024 added to rate cut hopes. The data set from the Commerce Department revealed that during the month the PCE jumped by 0.3% and over the year, it stood at 2.4%. Both of these figures met market estimates, and consequently, the S&P 500 jumped by 26 basis points, while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite (which includes some of the biggest growth stocks in the world) added 0.46% to its previous close.\n\nHowever, while the dark economic clouds take their sweet time to dissipate, a recent growth stock earnings report shows just how brutal smart money can be if its expectations are not met. This earnings report was for the Bozeman, Montana based cloud computing services provider Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and it saw the firm forecast its revenue for the current quarter to sit between $745 million and $750 million. This fell shy of the average analyst estimates of $765 million (according to Refinitiv), and the miss came as Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s management explained that economic uncertainty could drive its customers to reduce their spending. At the same time, the firm made a shocking announcement that revealed that its CEO Frank Slootman, who had joined in 2019 and led the firm to its current dominant role in the market, was retiring. Since such surprising announcements are rare for high growth stocks, investors reacted, and so far, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s shares have bled 19% since its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top performing growth stocks in January and February. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best American stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the US stock market trends and outlook, head over to 5 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nStocks are continuing their strong performance after a successful year, with the S&P 500 exceeding the 5,000 milestone. UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a \"Goldilocks\" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.\n\nThe 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February \"60 Minutes\" interview, acknowledged that the Fed's monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an \"overbought\" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains \"overbought\" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of \"overbought\" for three consecutive months or more.\n\nStory continues\n\nBofA analysts commented:\n\n\"A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX). This longer-term price momentum indicator moved to overbought in November 2023 and stayed overbought in December, January and February.\"\n\nSome of the best American stocks to buy this year include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's holdings that seeks to track the investment results of S&P Total Market Index, which is composed of U.S. equities.

The company generates over half of its revenue in the U.S. from its top-selling drugs Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz. The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”\n\n10. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”\n\n8.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

        "title": "11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best engineering stocks to buy for 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to the engineering and construction industry, known for its high technology and high capital expenditure, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy for 2024.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that engineering is responsible for most of the technological achievements of the human race. The way we live and work has changed significantly over the course of the past century, aided by advances in transportation that see thousands of aircraft take to the skies daily and 24/7 electricity ensured by heavy duty power generators that use fossil fuels or green energy sources such as solar plants and windmills.\n\nWhile engineering is also used to refer to software engineering and by extension the work of firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), typically, engineering stocks are those that deal with heavy duty industrial grade products or serve the needs of the construction industry. For instance, one of the most well known engineering stocks in the U.S. is the industrial giant General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). It makes a wide variety of advanced products such as turbines and jet engines, and with a market capitalization of $167 billion, the stock is just a couple of catalysts shy of transforming itself from a large cap to a mega cap.\n\nAnother example of an engineering stock is the diversified engineering and construction company Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR). Headquartered in Texas, the firm provides a wide variety of engineering services to the energy industry and includes other sectors such as construction in the mix as well.\n\nAs you might be starting to understand, the nature of engineering stocks means that they are exposed to a specific set of tailwinds and headwinds. For firms such as Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR), these can include those involving their businesses. Since a large portion of Fluor's revenue comes from oil exploration, should the world's appetite for the black gold start to shrink, then the firm's shares will drop as well Additionally, since a lot of engineering stocks provide services to the construction industry, any drop in construction activity or housing starts will naturally not bode well for the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, construction activity in the U.S. is also facing the heat from high interest rates. These make it difficult for builders to raise capital for new projects and also make it harder for prospective buyers to make pricey purchases. For instance, data from the Census Bureau shows that construction activity in the United States grew moderately annually in 2023 but did mark a double digit jump in December. In 2023, the total value of construction activity was worth $1.9 trillion to mark for a small 1% annual growth while in December 2023, a total of $2 trillion was spent on construction for a more noticeable 13.9% annual growth.\n\nBefore we get to our list of the best engineering stocks, it's quite important to see what investors believe will be the timeline for U.S. interest rate cuts. After all, rate cuts stimulate economic activity and end up being a headwind for industrial and engineering stocks. On this front, data from the CME FedWatch tool shows that 53% are optimistic for a 25 basis point cut in June 2024 and this probability increases to 61% for cuts ranging between 25 basis points and 50 basis points in July. Should these expectations hold and if the economy continues to perform, then engineering stocks can also rise with the tide.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best engineering stocks to buy. Some top names are KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR), Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR), and TopBuild Corp. (NYSE:BLD). 12 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nA crane carrying heavy building materials, representing the robust civil engineering products of the company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best engineering stocks to buy, we ranked the most valuable construction and engineering firms by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Only those industrial companies with a significant reliance on engineering for their business were chosen.\n\nFor these best engineering stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best hot stocks to buy for March. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half.\n\nThis surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively.\n\nYet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks.\n\nSo, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy. A couple of these are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

        "content": "(Adds the European Commission declines comment)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance have scrambled over the last six months to comply with landmark EU tech rules that come into force on Thursday, from overhauling online platforms to backroom engineering.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) is one of the most comprehensive regulatory actions to rein in so-called \"Big Tech\" and is expected to reshape the global technology industry after decades of unfettered growth. Criticism from rivals and users and cautionary comments from watchdogs suggest a couple of the six companies may be in the regulatory crosshairs over potential non-compliance in the coming months.\n\nIf any of the six tech giants are not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by the EU's Thursday deadline, they could ultimately face investigations and potentially fines of up to 10% of their global turnover.\n\nApple is the most affected by the DMA, which forces the iPhone maker to open up its closed ecosystem such as allowing software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of its own App Store.\n\nYet its introduction of new fees such as a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account each year even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system has already caught EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's eye.\n\nVestager said on Monday that novel fee structures should not undermine the incentives for businesses to switch to rivals, after handing a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine to Apple for thwarting Spotify from showing other payment options outside its App Store. Apple has said it will appeal the decision and declined to offer further comment.\n\nRivals such as Swiss email service Proton, meanwhile, have said Apple's compliance efforts do not go far enough. The Commission declined to comment.\n\nWith eight core platform services subject to the DMA, more than any other company, and despite putting thousands of tech engineers to work on its compliance efforts, Alphabet's Google also runs the risk of a potential investigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's mandatory overhaul of its search results will benefit aggregators such as Booking.com and Expedia, which will gain more prominence and hence online traffic due to their intensive lobbying with Google.\n\nThat has already caused friction with hotels, airlines and restaurants, with some expecting to lose as much as 50% of their online traffic and possibly millions of euros in revenues as users are lured to large online intermediaries.

        "title": "2 Trillion-Dollar \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is the apt moniker placed on a group of seven of the world's largest technology companies:\n\nApple  Microsoft  Amazon  Nvidia  Tesla  Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks delivered an average return of 112.7% in 2023, handily outperforming the S&P 500 index, which was up just 24%. Last year, owning all seven of them worked like a charm, but the group is fraying in the early stages of 2024, with Tesla stock plunging 29% and Apple down 12% so far this year.\n\nAs a result, investors might have to be more selective in 2024. Here's why Alphabet and Meta Platforms might be two of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy this month.\n\n1. Alphabet (Google)\n\nGoogle stock came public in 2004, but it created Alphabet in 2015 after expanding beyond its flagship internet search engine. Alphabet is now home to Google and a number of other high-profile subsidiaries, including YouTube, DeepMind, and Waymo. The $1.6 trillion tech conglomerate still rules the internet with Google Search, maintaining a 91% global market share, but investors have been more focused on its progress in artificial intelligence (AI) lately.\n\nMicrosoft made a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and immediately integrated the chatbot into its Bing search engine. Investors grew concerned that Google Search could be disrupted, sparking Alphabet's quest to catch up to Microsoft in the AI race.\n\nFollowing a slate of AI product releases, Alphabet says its latest Gemini chatbot outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, it's better at interpreting and creating text, images, videos, and computer code. Gemini is now available as a stand-alone chatbot, and it can also help businesses craft Search ads. Plus, Google Workspace customers can now access it for an additional fee, empowering them to increase their productivity across Gmail, Docs, Slides, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet delivered $307.4 billion in revenue during 2023, which was a 9% increase from 2022. The advertising-based business of Google Search still accounts for most of the conglomerate's revenue, and it saw an acceleration in growth in the fourth quarter. It's a positive sign the ad market continues to improve following a 2022 slump driven by rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nThose results saw Alphabet stock hit an all-time high in January of this year, but it has since declined by 13%, which presents investors with a buying opportunity.\n\nBased on the company's $5.80 in 2023 earnings per share and its current stock price of $133.35, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 23. That's a 30% discount to the 33 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, and it makes Alphabet the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. That's an incredibly attractive valuation for a company that has quickly become a leader in the AI space.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock price soared 194% in 2023, making it the second-best performer in the entire S&P 500 index behind only Nvidia. AI is one reason Meta Platforms is so popular among investors at the moment, but the company is also reaping the rewards from its expansive cost cuts, which have sent its profits soaring.\n\nMeta is using AI in a few ways. First, it's deploying the technology to deliver more relevant content to users on Facebook and Instagram, which drove an uptick in the amount of time they spent on those platforms during 2023. AI learns what content users like, and it curates their feeds to show them more of it. That additional time allows Meta to feed users more ads, which translates into more revenue for the company.\n\nSecond, Meta gives businesses AI tools to help them craft more engaging ads to drive more conversions. Additionally, each business on Meta's social platforms will eventually be able to deploy their own AI chatbot to handle incoming queries from customers through Messenger and WhatsApp. The chatbot will possess a broad knowledge of each unique business and reflect its core values.\n\nFinally, Meta has developed its own large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's open source whereas the LLMs underpinning generative AI applications like ChatGPT and Gemini are not. This strategy allows Meta to absorb feedback from thousands of developers to eliminate blind spots and accelerate improvements. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced plans to acquire 350,000 industry-leading H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia at an estimated cost of $9 billion, which will speed up Llama's development.\n\nZuckerberg declared 2023 a \"year of efficiency\" following a 76% peak-to-trough plunge in its stock price between 2021 and 2022. He slashed more than 21,000 jobs and committed to moderating the company's spending on initiatives like the metaverse in favor of investing heavily in its core social platforms and AI. The result was a 16% year-over-year jump in revenue and a whopping 73% increase in earnings per share (profit) during 2023.\n\nDespite the 544% gain in Meta stock from its 2022 low point -- which catapulted the company back to a $1 trillion valuation -- it still only trades at a P/E ratio of 33.2, which is basically in line with the Nasdaq-100. Considering Wall Street is forecasting a further 34% earnings growth in 2024, Meta stock still looks cheap at its current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Meta Shifts Focus to Enterprise Applications in the Metaverse\n\nMeta, the social media giant previously known as Facebook, is seemingly shifting its focus away from individual-centric metaverse experiences and towards enterprise applications and artificial intelligence (AI). This apparent pivot is reflected in a recent blog post titled \"Game Changers: 3 Predictions for Technological Transformation in 2024 & Beyond.\"\n\nThe first prediction highlights Meta's potential change in direction. It suggests that the metaverse will find its initial value in enterprise and educational settings, possibly indicating a strategic pivot towards increasing adoption of their Quest VR headset hardware by businesses.\n\nFurthermore, the post seemingly acknowledges the decline in metaverse hype, calling it \"dead\" and contrasting it with the rising interest in AI. While acknowledging consumer interest in the metaverse, evidenced by the Quest app's performance on the App Store, Meta emphasizes business applications like collaborative computer-aided design tools. This suggests a potential reorientation of their metaverse strategy towards enterprise needs.\n\nMeta's second prediction focuses on \"portable artificial intelligence,\" specifically onboard large language models (LLMs). Unlike powerful systems like ChatGPT and Claude, which rely on cloud connectivity, onboard LLMs could operate directly on devices. This approach could allow Meta to integrate metaverse hardware with augmented reality (AR) to create informative heads-up displays for everyday use.\n\nFinally, the third prediction emphasizes the importance of business messaging tools within the metaverse. \"People expect to interact with brands and businesses they support in new, more personal ways,\" the blog post emphasizes. This could signal a potential future where brands interact with consumers within the metaverse through AI-powered tools and engaging experiences.",

        "content": "The Q4 earnings cycle has primarily finished, with most S&P 500 companies already reporting. It’s been a positive period, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong performance. On the other hand, the Energy sector has been weighing negatively on the earnings picture.\n\nSeveral companies stole the spotlight throughout the period – Meta Platforms META, NVIDIA NVDA, and Deckers Outdoor DECK – posting robust quarterly results. Shares jumped following the release of each, reflecting investors’ bullish reactions.\n\nIn addition to solid quarterly results, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nDeckers Outdoor\n\nDeckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities.\n\nThe revisions trend has been notably bullish for its current fiscal year, with the $26.85 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate 24% higher over the last year and suggesting 38% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning headline figures, DECK posted a 32% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 8.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 44% and 16%, respectively. Impressively, EPS of $15.11 and revenue of $1.6 million reflected quarterly records, driven by strength across its UGG and HOKA brands.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDeckers provided bright guidance following the release, now expecting current-year net sales of $4.15 billion and a gross margin of 54.5%.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nRegarding the report in focus, Meta Platforms generated $40.1 billion in sales, improving by a sizable 25% from the year-ago period. Top-line results reflect a considerable acceleration, with the 25% jump penciling in the highest year-over-year growth rate in eight quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and earnings expectations are rising across all timeframes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s platform also continues to expand, with Facebook daily and monthly active users growing by 6% and 3%, respectively. And its advertising business remains sound, with ad impressions delivered across its family of apps improving 21% year-over-year.\n\nMETA has consistently posted better-than-expected advertising revenue, exceeding our consensus expectations in six consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nOf course, Data Center was the real highlight of NVIDIA’s quarterly release, which included sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in $18.4 billion (another quarterly record) throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nRobust quarterly results have led analysts to rapidly revise their earnings expectations higher over the last year, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s growth profile is remarkably bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 80% earnings growth on 70% higher sales. And the growth doesn’t stop, with FY26 expectations alluding to an additional 11% bump in earnings on 15% higher revenues.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings cycle is essentially over, with the vast majority of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The Technology sector has been a significant contributor, helping brighten the overall market landscape.\n\nAnd for those seeking post-earnings positivity, all three companies above – Meta Platforms META, NVIDIA NVDA, and Deckers Outdoor DECK – posted results that had investors impressed.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Meta Platforms (META) closed at $496.09, marking a +1.2% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.51% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.58%.\n\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 7.81% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.47% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.94%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $4.27, showcasing a 61.74% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $36.07 billion, reflecting a 25.94% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nMETA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.94 per share and revenue of $158.75 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +34.1% and +17.68%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.97% upward. At present, Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to valuation, Meta Platforms is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.59. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.49.\n\nIt's also important to note that META currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.26. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.8.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 46, which puts it in the top 19% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Imagine Elon Musk as Donald Trump’s boss",
        "content": "Here’s a tantalizing, or terrifying, prospect, depending on how you look at it: The world's richest man could get behind Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and use his billions to help Trump get elected.\n\nElon Musk made a recent pilgrimage to Florida to meet with the former president, according to the New York Times, fueling speculation that the Trumpy, irascible CEO of Tesla and SpaceX could get far more involved in presidential politics this year than he ever has before.\n\nMusk later tweeted that he is “not donating money to either candidate for US President.” But Musk is well known for Trumpian turnabouts. “He’s exaggerated, overpromised, skirted facts, and lied,” Rolling Stone wrote last year in a story listing 13 of Musk’s biggest whoppers. So Musk could recant and get behind Trump after all.\n\nMusk, who also owns the social media platform X, certainly fancies himself a geopolitical influencer. In 2022, he pitched a peace plan for the Ukraine war, and he may or may not have spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin to get his views. At certain points in the war, Musk has made decisions about the battlefield use of SpaceX’s Starlink internet service that influenced military outcomes on the ground.\n\nMusk also has strong opinions about “free speech,” electric cars, government regulation, immigration, and other hot-button political issues, just as Trump does. Musk’s a libertarian who seems to be getting more conservative as he gets older, and he’s no fan of President Joe Biden. He called Biden a “damp sock puppet\" in 2022 and has jabbed him on a variety of issues.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, needs money, so the stars might be aligning for a bromance between Trump and the 21st century's wannabe overlord.\n\nIf Musk got behind Trump, there could be tension over who’s really in charge. Musk is nobody’s No. 2, and if he financed Trump’s path to victory, he’d probably want to call the shots on issues that matter to him. Money talks, especially in politics, and Musk has about 100 times as much as Trump. And money wins, especially with Trump.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would Musk want from Trump? If Musk actually helped Trump win the presidency, it’s not hard to imagine these five asks:\n\nDismantle the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk hates the SEC, which punished him for a bogus 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private and has continued to stay up in his grill. Trump hates government regulation about as much as Musk does. Done.\n\nTurn AI over to Tesla. In the wrong hands, artificial intelligence could eliminate all jobs or allow Musk’s business competitors to gain an edge. Only Musk, and maybe Joe Rogan, can safeguard this revolutionary technology and save humanity. All it will take is Justice Dept. pressure and some friendly judges appointed by Trump to force AI divestitures at Microsoft and Google and establish Tesla as the favored bidder.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nBan Facebook. Shut. Them. Down! Shut. Them. Down! Also Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Only X upholds the First Amendment by allowing anybody to say anything. Once X becomes the everything app, there will be no need for other social media platforms, anyway.\n\nHalt all immigration. Except from South Africa.\n\nMake sure space remains nonunionized. Space Force, the agency Trump created, would be the enforcer. Much better than letting Biden’s unions infiltrate space and bring all hopes of colonizing Mars to a halt over trifling issues such as interplanetary working conditions. Then-President Donald Trump meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2017. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) (NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images)\n\nThose are softball requests that align closely with Trump’s own views. Three other Musk requests could be a tougher sell.\n\nElectric cars. Musk made most of his fortune from them, but Trump wants electric car supporters to “rot in hell.” Hmmmm. Awkward. Maybe Trump is persuadable. Musk could give him a ride in a bulletproof Tesla Cybertruck, show off the beast mode, and even let Trump fire some arrows at the vehicle. Before you know it, a stretch version of the Cybertruck could get the next contract for a presidential limousine.\n\nClimate change. Musk says it’s real, Trump says it’s a hoax. But Trump would probably change his story if Musk offered to pay some of his legal fees or court fines.\n\nTruth Social. As a condition of gaining Musk’s support in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump’s social media network would have to buy X for $44 billion. That might seem like a lot until you think about how much money a shrewd self-promoter can make by monetizing the American presidency. And it could all start with the Tesla Cybertruck, President Donald J. Trump Limited Edition.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Social media outages hurt small businesses -- so it's important to have a backup plan",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — To businesses that rely on social media platforms for advertising, client communication or direct sales, Tuesday's Meta platforms outage was more than a communal inconvenience.\n\nExperts say that whenever there's an outage — be it social media or other softwarewe've come to rely on — it’s a reminder that small businesses need to make sure they aren’t reliant on one platform and have contingency plans in place — like an email database — when an outage does occur.\n\nCheyenne Smith, in Salt Lake City, Utah, founder of Dakota Ridge, an e-commerce company selling children's shoes, relies on Meta's platforms, primarily Instagram, to grow her customer base, via a mix of unpaid Instagram posts and paid ads.\n\nShe said she couldn't quantify specifically how many sales she lost during the outage, but anecdotally said when the site went down, sales flowing to her e-commerce site stopped completely. But she says she has no plans to end her reliance on Meta's platforms, because they drive more sales than other social media sites she has tried.\n\n“We are trying other social media channels, we just haven’t been able to crack the code on them just yet, like we have on the Meta platform,” she said. “So it’s kind of, in my opinion, a necessary evil for us.”\n\nStill, experts say it's important to look beyond one site, particularly when it comes to growing a customer database.\n\n“Yesterday was a wakeup call to many, many business owners,” said Ramon Ray, a small business consultant who often speaks publicly about marketing. He advised small business owners to use the outage itself to goad customers into providing their email addresses, so there's more than one avenue for communication.\n\n“For customers, if you’re only communicating with them on Facebook say — ‘Listen, Facebook was out yesterday, we want to ensure we can always serve you,'\" he said. \"'Could you fill out this form with your cell number, first name, last name, email so we can start to serve you better?’”\n\nStory continues\n\nLaura Levitan, owner of Mod L Photography, in Addison, Texas, uses Facebook and Instagram to correspond with potential clients. When the outage happened, she had been in the middle of posting and replying to inquiries.\n\n“I lost valuable time creating posts and Reels on Meta Business Suite, all of my progress was deleted,” she said. \"I wasn’t able to get back to several inquiries in a timely fashion. This may or may not influence my ability to earn their business.”\n\nHowever, she was able to use her email list and website to communicate with other clients. She doesn't plan to shift away from any Meta platforms — but does plan to continue to build up her offsite communications.\n\n“Because the outage was so pervasive I’m not sure what else I could do besides continuing to build my email list and website presence,” she said. “When we own our email list we aren’t as dependent on social media to prop up our communications and marketing.”\n\nDavid Lewis, CEO of HR firm Operations, Inc., which advises small businesses, said that as we grow ever more reliant on the Internet to do business, outages are just a reality that small businesses have to get used to.\n\n“You just have to accept the fact that there’s going to be these kinds of disruptions and be more appreciative of the fact that it doesn’t happen more often than it does,” he said.",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Forty U.S. states and Washington, D.C. called on Meta Platforms to crack down on scammers who hijack Facebook and Instagram accounts, to address a \"dramatic\" surge in account takeovers.\n\nIn a letter to Meta's chief lawyer, states led by New York Attorney General Letitia James said fraudsters are \"winning the war and running rampant on Meta,\" after the company in November 2022 announced thousands of job cuts focused on security and privacy.\n\nThe states said New York has since 2019 received a 1,000% increase in complaints about scammers who access accounts and change passwords, enabling them to read private messages and pose as actual users to deceive contacts and the public.\n\nFour of the states — Illinois, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Vermont — reported increases in complaints exceeding 250% in the last year alone.\n\n\"Social media is how millions of Americans connect,\" James said in a statement. \"Having your social media account taken over by a scammer can feel like having someone sneak into your home and change all of the locks.\"\n\nThe states urged Meta to spend more money to prevent account takeovers, including through increased staffing, and to work more closely with people whose accounts are hacked.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a Meta spokeswoman said the Menlo Park, California-based company invests \"heavily\" in technology and staffing to identify compromised accounts, and shares tips with users and law enforcement to address the problem.\n\nAlso signing the letter were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nIn October, 41 states and Washington, D.C. sued Meta, claiming the company designed its platforms to addict children, damaging their mental health.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in March, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. After oscillating between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all climbed to record highs in 2024.\n\nThough there have been select pockets of strength fueling this surge in the broader market, Wall Street's gains primary fall on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have powered the broader market higher\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to seven of the largest and most-influential businesses that have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over an extended stretch. These seven stocks are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAs noted, these stocks have run circles around the S&P 500 for quite some time. MSFT Chart\n\nBut what they've really brought to the table for investors is sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in various aspects of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the world's leading desktop operating system, while Azure accounts for a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spending, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Apple's ongoing innovation has given the iPhone a commanding market share lead among smartphones in the United States. The former largest company in the world also boasts the beefiest share repurchase program on the planet. Nvidia's has become the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for up to a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. Further, Amazon Web Services tops Microsoft's Azure as the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google is a practical monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure provider, and YouTube is the second most-visited social site. Meta Platforms oversees the top social media assets, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Meta's family of apps attracted close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the first automaker to build itself from the ground up to mass-production in over a half-century. It's also the only pure-play EV maker generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven companies could differ greatly. As we motor into March, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain hiding in plain sight, while another highflier is liable to contend with mounting headwinds.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in March: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven long-term outperformers listed above, the most-attractive Magnificent Seven stock for opportunistic investors in March is Alphabet.\n\nIf Alphabet can be faulted for anything, it's being a cyclical company. Last year, 76% of the company's $86.3 billion in net sales were traced back to advertising. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's practically a given that businesses would pare back their ad budgets. At the moment, a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators do signal a high likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, economic cycles aren't even. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, there have been two periods of growth that sustained for longer than a decade. Advertising-driven businesses like Alphabet (and Meta, since we're discussing the Magnificent Seven) are primed for long-term upside as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThere's no question that Alphabet's internet search segment Google is its foundation. A nearly 92% share of worldwide search makes Google the undisputed company businesses are going to seek out for ad placement in order to target consumers. More often than not, Alphabet should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut as I've noted in the past, the Alphabet growth story is about far more than just its dominant internet search engine. Google Cloud has gobbled up about 10% of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its relatively early stages, which suggests this segment can grow by a sustained double-digit pace.\n\nWhat's more, Google Cloud delivered its first year of operating profits in 2023 after multiple years of losses. Cloud services consistently boast higher margins than advertising, which suggests Alphabet's cash flow growth is set to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nYouTube is a beast, too. Daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds), which were introduced in 2021, have catapulted from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to more than 50 billion in early 2023. This should help the company draw in advertisers, as well as boost high-margin subscriptions to YouTube.\n\nLastly, Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. Since Alphabet reinvests a lot of what it generates from its operations, cash flow is the best metric to value the company. Investors can buy Alphabet shares right now for a little over 12 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which is a 31% discount to its trailing-five-year cash flow multiple. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in March: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is poised for continued glory. Among the seven most-influential companies driving Wall Street higher over the past year and change, it's semiconductor stock Nvidia that should be avoided like the plague.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has enjoyed ample competitive advantages in the AI arena. GPU scarcity has driven prices of its A100 and H100 chips to the moon, which in turn allowed the company to more than double its sales last year. While Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, the company is set to face headwinds galore.\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest problems is itself. As supply chain issues ease and Nvidia expands production of its A100 and H100 GPUs to meet more demand, scarcity of GPUs will decline. Price-driven scarcity accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's sales gains last year, as evidenced by cost of revenue declining through the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). As Nvidia expands production, it'll likely cannibalize its own margins.\n\nNvidia will also have competition coming at it from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices is stepping up the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel is set to begin fulfilling orders for its Gaudi3 AI-GPU later this year.\n\nThe real concern is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers are also developing AI data center chips of their own. This includes Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, which account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's sales. Not only is it highly unlikely that these four companies will sustain recent purchase activity from Nvidia, but the AI chips they're developing will lessen future reliance on the current AI kingpin.\n\nRegulators aren't doing Nvidia any favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of high-powered AI chips to China. This includes AI GPUs that Nvidia had developed specifically for the world's No. 2 economy after regulators initially clamped down on exports. Regulators could be costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nFollowing the money of company insiders is another reason to avoid Nvidia like the plague. While there have been plenty of sales, there hasn't been a single insider purchase in more than three years. Insiders only buy for one reason: they believe the stock will head higher. If they aren't adding, why should you?\n\nBut maybe the biggest concern for Nvidia and its shareholders is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption of new technology and innovation; and it appears to be happening in real time, once again.\n\nNvidia is valued at close to 34 times its trailing-12-month sales, which is a valuation reminiscent of Cisco Systems during the height of the dot-com bubble. This makes Nvidia an interesting story stock, but one to avoid like the plague for investment purposes in March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best March dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend capture strategy and performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nDividend investing is highly favored among investors because of its potential for long-term benefits. However, there's another approach called the dividend capture strategy, which some investors employ to focus on short-term gains. This strategy involves frequent trading with the goal of capturing the cash payouts from more stocks than one would typically receive through traditional buy-and-hold methods. Unlike the conventional approach where investors hold onto stocks for longer periods, dividend capture involves swiftly moving in and out of various stocks to secure a continuous flow of dividends. It's essentially an income-oriented trading strategy that aims to generate dividends from a diverse range of stocks over short timeframes, rather than relying on periodic payouts from a select few stocks.\n\nRegardless of the specific investment approach, dividend stocks have consistently captured investors' attention due to their reliable returns over time. Particularly, companies that have consistently increased their dividend payouts have historically outperformed other asset classes. As indicated in a report from Nuveen, over extended periods, companies that consistently raise dividends or initiate dividend payments have demonstrated superior returns with lower risk, as measured by standard deviation, compared to companies that maintain, reduce, or eliminate their dividends. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend growth stocks to invest in. Aside from focusing on the growth of dividends, the report also highlighted the significance of payout ratios. Companies that are barely earning enough to cover dividend payments or those allocating most of their earnings as dividends might face challenges from competitors. This is because their cash flow might not be adequate to sustain their operations effectively. Moreover, companies with high dividend yields, particularly those with high payout ratios, could face risks of limited future growth. This situation could potentially endanger both the appreciation of share prices and the growth of dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, the S&P 500's dividend payout ratio is currently lower than its typical long-term average, and consensus forecasts predict an 11% growth in earnings per share for 2024. These factors are expected to contribute to attractive returns for shareholders. Furthermore, companies are maintaining substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets, totaling $1.9 trillion as of September 30, 2023, which is close to the highest levels seen in the past twenty years. Additionally, with equity market valuations surpassing their long-term averages, there's a likelihood that corporate management teams will prioritize dividend growth in 2024 over stock buybacks as a means of rewarding shareholders, given the elevated valuations.\n\nAgainst commonly held beliefs, dividend growth from companies showed resilience throughout 2023, spanning various sectors and geographical regions, as reported by Janus Henderson. However, certain sectors such as mining, select energy stocks, and chemicals experienced challenges in this regard. Notably, the market observed a higher standard of dividend growth, with a reduced dependence on one-time special dividends and exchange rate fluctuations, which were prominent features in 2022. The firm maintained a positive outlook on dividends, although it exercised caution as companies and economies adapt to higher interest rates. It emphasized that dividends have demonstrated less volatility compared to earnings over time, with the majority of companies consistently increasing dividends annually. Furthermore, dividends exhibit less cyclical behavior than commonly perceived by investors. Sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications are known for their consistent dividend payouts, offering a protective cushion against sectors more susceptible to economic fluctuations, such as banks, energy, and mining. Taking an active and diversified approach to income investing across various regions and sectors can provide reassurance during periods of market uncertainty and facilitate the accumulation of long-term wealth.\n\nIn view of this, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy in March. 11 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in March 2024.

        "title": "Europe's Digital Markets Act is forcing tech giants to make changes. Here's what that will look like",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Europeans scrolling their phones and computers this week will get new choices for default browsers and search engines, where to download iPhone apps and how their personal online data is used.\n\nThey're part of changes required under the Digital Markets Act, a set of European Union regulations that six tech companies classed as “gatekeepers” — Amazon, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — will have to start following by midnight Wednesday.\n\nThe DMA is the latest in a series of regulations that Europe has passed as a global leader in reining in the dominance of large tech companies. Tech giants have responded by changing some of their long-held ways of doing business — such as Apple allowing people to install smartphone apps outside of its App Store.\n\nThe new rules have broad but vague goals of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable.\" They are kicking in as efforts around the world to crack down on the tech industry are picking up pace.\n\nHere's a look at how the Digital Markets Act will work:\n\nWHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES?\n\nSome 22 services, from operating systems to messenger apps and social media platforms, will be in the DMA's crosshairs.\n\nThey include Google services like Maps, YouTube, the Chrome browser and Android operating system, plus Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's Safari Browser and iOS.\n\nMeta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are included as well as Microsoft's Windows and LinkedIn.\n\nThe companies face the threat of hefty fines worth up to 20% of their annual global revenue for repeated violations — which could amount to billions of dollars — or even a breakup of their businesses for “systematic infringements.”\n\nWHAT EFFECT WILL THE RULES HAVE GLOBALLY?\n\nThe Digital Markets Act is a fresh milestone for the 27-nation European Union in its longstanding role as a worldwide trendsetter in clamping down on the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bloc has previously hit Google with whopping fines in antitrust cases, rolled out tough rules to clean up social media and is bringing in world-first artificial intelligence regulations.\n\nNow, places like Japan, Britain, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and India are drawing up their own versions of DMA-like rules aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.\n\n\"We’re seeing copycats around the world already,\" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based think tank. The DMA “will become the defacto standard” for digital regulation in the democratic world, he said.\n\nOfficials will be looking to Brussels for guidance, said Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London.\n\n“If it works, many Western countries will probably try to follow the DMA to avoid fragmentation and the risk of taking a different approach that fails,” he said.\n\nHOW WILL DOWNLOADING APPS CHANGE?\n\nIn one of the biggest changes, Apple has said it will let European iPhone users download apps outside its App Store, which comes installed on its mobile devices.\n\nThe company has long resisted such a move, with a big chunk of its revenue coming from the 30% fee it charges for payments — such as for Disney+ subscriptions — made through iOS apps. Apple has warned that “sideloading” apps will come with added security risks.\n\nNow, Apple is cutting those fees it collects from app developers in Europe that opt to stay within the company’s payment-processing system. But it's adding a 50-euro cent fee for each iOS app installed through third-party app stores, which critics say will deter the many existing free apps — whose developers currently don't pay any fee — from jumping ship.\n\n“Why would they possibly opt into a world where they have to pay a 50 cent per-user fee?” said Avery Gardiner, Spotify's global director of competition policy. “So those alternative app stores will never get traction, because they’ll be missing this huge chunk of apps that would need to be there in order for customers to find the store attractive.\"\n\n“That is utterly at odds with the very purpose of the DMA,” Gardiner added.\n\nBrussels will be closely scrutinizing whether tech companies are complying.\n\nEU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said this week that after 10 years on the job, “I have seen quite a number of antitrust cases and quite a lot of creativity built into how to work around the rules that we have.\"\n\nHOW WILL PEOPLE GET MORE OPTIONS ONLINE?\n\nConsumers won't be forced into default choices for key services.\n\nAndroid users can pick which search engine to use by default, while iPhone users will get to choose which browser will be their go-to. Europeans will see choice screens on their devices. Microsoft, meanwhile, will stop forcing people to use its Edge browser.\n\nThe idea is to stop people from being nudged into using Apple’s Safari browser or Google’s Search app. But smaller players still worry that they might end up worse off than before.\n\nUsers might just stick with what they recognize because they don't know anything about the other options, said Christian Kroll, CEO of Berlin-based search engine Ecosia.\n\nEcosia has been pushing for Apple and Google to include more information about rival services in the choice screens.\n\n“If people don’t know what the alternatives are, it’s rather unlikely that many of them will select an alternative,” Kroll said. “I’m a big fan of the DMA. I am not sure yet if it will have the results that we’re hoping for.”\n\nHOW WILL INTERNET SEARCHES CHANGE?\n\nSome Google search results will show up differently, because the DMA bans companies from giving preference to their own services.\n\nSo, for example, searches for hotels will now display an extra \"carousel\" of booking sites like Expedia. Meanwhile, the Google Flights button on the search result display will be removed and the site will be listed among the blue links on search result pages.\n\nUsers also will have options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising based on their online activity.\n\nGoogle users are getting the choice to stop data from being shared across the company’s services to help better target them with ads.\n\nMeta is allowing users to separate their Facebook and Instagram accounts so their personal information can't be combined for ad targeting.\n\nThe DMA also requires messaging systems to be able to work with each other. Meta, which owns the only two chat apps that fall under the rules, is expected to come up with a proposal on how Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp users can exchange text messages, videos and images.",

        "content": "Investors looking to exceed the returns of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 may want to start their search with hypergrowth tech stocks. The tech sector is filled with corporations that have outperform the stock market over many years. Some of those stocks have matured but others can keep going.\n\nWhile mega-cap stocks have proven track records, smaller tech companies can also tap into hypergrowth and reward long-term investors. If you’re looking for promising hypergrowth tech stocks, you may want to take a closer look at these top picks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best hypergrowth tech stocks in the market and is a staple in many mutual funds and ETFs. The tech giant is up by 63% over the past year and surged by 276% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s main growth engine is still churning along at a nice pace. Microsoft Cloud revenue was up by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24. Overall revenue was up by 18% year-over-year while net income increased by 33% year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue. However, the firm has exposure to other exciting verticals like gaming, business software, and artificial intelligence. Microsoft has made big investments in the latter and is positioning itself as one of the leaders in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft also offers a dividend yield which stands at 0.72%. The company has regularly increased its dividend by 10% or more each year.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a fintech company that has a large percentage of the credit and debit card market. The company earns revenue on every Visa credit or debit card transaction. And many investors use this stock as a bellwether to measure the economy’s strength.\n\nVisa’s latest financial report pointed to resilient consumer spending. Revenue increased by 9% year-over-year while net income was up by 17% year-over-year. Visa is a stable company that has delivered reliable returns and financial growth over the years. Shares have recorded a 1-year gain of 27% and a 5-year gain of 92%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also has a dividend yield hovering above 0.70%. The company recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share. That’s a 15.4% year-over-year increase. Visa should continue to perform well as consumer spending rises. Even if people have to cut back on purchases, most of them will still use credit cards due to the great reward programs.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has produced millionaires thanks to an AI-fueled rally. Shares are up by 244% over the past year and have gained more than 2,000% over the past five years\n\nUnlike most AI stocks, Nvidia is living up to the hype. The company posted another dominant quarter which featured 265% year-over-year revenue growth and 491% year-over-year net income growth. Those growth rates help support the recent stock price movement and give the rally a better foundation.\n\nNvidia only trades at 34x forward earnings. The company’s significant net income growth makes the valuation easier to justify and presents an opportunity. Despite massive gains already, Nvidia still has room to run.\n\nThe company’s rapid growth and excitement around the stock create the possibility of it becoming the largest publicly traded corporation. Nvidia shares have to gain an additional 50% from current levels to reach that milestone. It may not happen right away, but the string of “Buy” ratings suggest that Nvidia can eventually become a more valuable company than Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s easy to forget how well-run Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) main revenue drivers are. The corporation is behind in the artificial intelligence race but is still the leading advertising giant. Alphabet has significantly increased net profit margins due to its cost-cutting measures, and the latest earnings report put those efforts on full display.\n\nAlphabet grew its revenue by 13% year-over-year and increased net income by 52% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company’s net profit margin rose to 24.0%.\n\nThe advertising network and Google Cloud continue to perform well. More advertisements related to the Olympic Games and the Election will help Alphabet report higher earnings. Net profits should grow at a faster rate than revenue and lead to higher profit margins.\n\nDespite having a strong business model, many investors are fixated on the company’s recent AI blunders. The stock offers a generous 25 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and has still outperformed the market. Shares are up by 47% over the past year and have gained 142% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the other leading advertising giant. After a strong resurgence in 2023 centered around cost-cutting and a return to revenue growth, the company continued its rally into 2024.\n\nResults from the fourth quarter of 2023 suggest the company can connote to reward investors. During that quarter, revenue increased by 25% year-over-year while net income surged by 201% year-over-year. Full year revenue was up by 16% year-over-year while full year net income increased by 69% year-over-year. Meta Platforms is accelerating its growth rates leading into a year that normally sees more demand for advertisements.\n\nThe company also achieved impressive growth rates for its social networks. Daily active users increased by 8% year-over-year while monthly active users were up by 6% year-over-year.\n\nFacebook drove impressive growth, but other social networks within the Meta Platforms umbrella performed even better. The company even announced a $0.50 dividend. Meta Platforms will likely have many years of 10%+ year-over-year dividend increases for its new program.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) has everything going for it except its valuation. Investors who are willing to wait a few years for the valuation to become more reasonable may benefit from adding a small position. Waiting for a dip is also a great choice.\n\nThe educational app has experienced high revenue growth for many years. The company continued with that trend by reporting 45% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Daily active users and monthly active users were also up by impressive numbers.\n\nThe big story for this stock was the dramatic surge in net income. Duolingo reported $12.1 million in net income which was a big turnaround from a $13.9 million net loss in the same period last year. Duolingo made the switch to profitability earlier in 2023, but this quarter demonstrates how quickly profit margins are expanding.\n\nHigher profit margins can result in a lower valuation and make sure look like a bargain in a few years for investors who accumulate positions now. However, the stock currently has a 141 forward P/E ratio. You’ll have to keep that in mind before buying this educational tech company.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a fintech company that has many software products under its umbrella. The corporation owns Turbotax, Quickbooks, Mailchimp, and other resources. The stock has consistently outperformed the market and has gained 171% over the past five years. The company is also up by 63% over the past year.\n\nIntuit once again reported revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company’s $3.4 billion in revenue was 11% higher than the same period last year. However, investors got more excited about the company more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. The significant growth brought the stock’s forward P/E ratio to 41.\n\nIntuit is still growing at a respectable pace and offers vital tools with monthly subscription plans. Many taxpayers use the company’s tools to make the tax season less stressful. In addition, many companies rely on Mailchimp to communicate with their audiences.\n\nAnalysts are also feeling optimistic about the stock. The fintech company has a “Strong Buy” rating from 22 analysts and an average price target that indicates more upside from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, NVDA, and GOOG.

        "title": "Meta attorneys ask judge to dismiss shareholder suit alleging failure to address human trafficking",
        "content": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Attorneys for Meta Platforms and several of its current and former leaders, including founder Mark Zuckerberg, are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging the company has deliberately failed to protect users of its social media platforms from human trafficking and child sexual exploitation.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed last year by several investment funds, claims that Meta’s directors and senior executives have long known about rampant human trafficking and child sexual exploitation on Facebook and Instagram, but have failed to address the predatory behavior.\n\n“For years, Meta’s directors and senior executives have known that pedophiles and human and sex traffickers have been using Facebook and Instagram to facilitate their noxious activities,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Mackintosh told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster during a hearing Tuesday. “But despite this, Meta’s directors utterly failed to implement board level oversight and controls to ferret out these heinous activities and to stop them from proliferating on Meta’s platforms.”\n\nDavid Ross, an attorney for Meta, argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the alleged conduct of the company’s leaders has not resulted in Meta suffering “corporate trauma” as required by Delaware law. The company also argues that the lawsuit’s claims are based on speculation that it might face future harm or loss.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend, however, Meta has already suffered harm, including sharp drops in its share price and market capitalization amid media reports about trafficking and child sex abuse involving its platforms. They also point to “massive legal defense costs” in related litigation and allege that Meta also has suffered “reputational harm.”\n\nMeta also argues that the lawsuit must be dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to demand that the board take action before filing their lawsuit. Such a demand is typically required before a shareholder can file a “derivative complaint” on behalf of a corporation over alleged harm to the company caused by its officers or directors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe plaintiffs say the demand requirement should be excused as “futile” because board directors are defendants who face a substantial likelihood of liability, and many are beholden to Zuckerberg instead of being independent.\n\nMackintosh said Meta directors have ignored several red flags, including lawsuits, media reports, shareholder resolutions, and increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators of online activity, that should have alerted the board to act. Documents provided by the company in response to the lawsuit, she added, suggest little if any board discussions regarding human trafficking and child sexual exploitation.\n\nUnder Delaware law, corporate directors can be held liable for failing to exercise proper oversight to ensure legal compliance with relevant statutes. Laster noted, however, that there has been debate in legal circles on whether Delaware’s law regarding director oversight can be applied to business risks, not just legal compliance.\n\n“If we were going to have a business risk that actually could trigger this, it seems like not dealing with a massive child porn problem might be a good one,” said Laster, who said he will rule at a later date.",

        "content": "Facebook's services are among those affected - Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nUsers of YouTube and Facebook experienced disruption this afternoon, with hundreds of thousands of users reporting problems.\n\nIssues began around 3pm, with the outage affecting Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google. The outages have been tracked by the website Downdetector.\n\nAt 5:19pm, Meta announced that the outage affecting its services was now over. Google told The Telegraph that it “saw a surge in traffic ... and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.”\n\nLondon-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.”\n\nBut the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, which are typically imposed by governments.\n\nAccording to a Google status website, there were also reports of problems with some of its services aimed at advertisers.\n\nIt is understood that the outages were not caused by a cyberattack.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.\n\nIts failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.\n\nLord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.\n\n05:42 PM GMT\n\nGoogle says it has ‘scaled up’ services to combat issues\n\nA Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:\n\nWe saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.\n\n05:37 PM GMT\n\nFacebook says outage over\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:\n\nEarlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services.

The official said:\n\nWe are aware of the incident and at this time we are not aware of any specific election nexus or any specific malicious cyber activity.\n\n05:21 PM GMT\n\nOzempic boom saved Denmark from recession, say analysts\n\nSurging demand for weight-loss drugs helped to save Denmark from recession last year, a leading bank has said. Hannah Boland reports:\n\nDanske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.\n\nThe stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.\n\nAnalysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”\n\nNovo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.\n\nThe company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.\n\nSales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.\n\nHigh levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc. The injectable drug Ozempic has contributed to Danish economic growth - David J.

Meanwhile, Google’s Ad Manager is experiencing “service disruption”, according to its official status page, while Google is “investigating reports of an issue” with its AdMob and AdSense services.

Shares in Wincanton fell 4.5pc to 596p.\n\nThe business was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate.\n\nToday its main business is running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose.\n\n04:14 PM GMT\n\nEvery little helps as Tesco hikes shop workers’ pay\n\nTesco is to increase store workers’ pay by 9.1pc in an act worth roughly £300m.\n\nIt is the latest supermarket group to lift pay levels for workers ahead of the rise in the national minimum wage in April.\n\nThe national minimum wage will increase from its current rate of £10.42 per hour to £11.44 on April 1.\n\nThe grocery giant, which employs more than 330,000 people across the UK, will raise the basic hourly rate for store workers from £11.02 per hour to £12.02.\n\nIt will also increase the pay of workers within the M25 to £13.15 per hour, from a current rate of £11.95 for those in inner London and £11.75 for those in outer London.\n\nTesco UK chief executive Matthew Barnes said:\n\nThis represents another significant investment in our colleagues, building on the last two years of investment.\n\nWe recognise the amazing work our colleagues do every day in serving our customers and we’re really proud to offer such competitive rates of pay alongside a great range of exclusive colleague benefits.\n\nIt comes days after rival Asda said it will increase its basic rate of staff pay to £12.04 per hour later this year.

Mr Lynch took the fraud office to court last month in an effort to force it to hand over correspondence with US authorities, information that he believes could help his upcoming US criminal defence.\n\nDetails of the settlement are confidential.

Foxtons said there are more homes available on the rental market and fewer tenants chasing each available letting - Jason Alden/Bloomberg\n\n07:49 AM GMT\n\nTech tester Spirent snapped up in £1bn deal\n\nBritish technology testing and security business Spirent will be taken over by Viavi in a £1bn deal in the latest overseas swoop on a UK-listed company.\n\nCommunications equipment business Viavi will offer 172.5p per share and a special dividend of 2.5p per share as part of the deal, which represents a 61.4pc premium on Spirent’s closing price of 108.4p on Monday.\n\nThere has been a flurry of merger and acquisition activity of UK companies since the turn of the year, as many businesses are perceived to be undervalued.\n\nLast week, US logistics company GXO tabled an official bid for British grocery haulier Wincanton in a takeover battle with French shipping business CMA CGM.\n\n07:34 AM GMT\n\n‘Impressive’ Greggs doing simple things well, say analysts\n\nGreggs revealed it would pay a final dividend of 46p per share after revealing record profits, taking its total ordinary dividend per share of 62p per share, up 5.1pc from 2022.\n\nCharlie Huggins of Wealth Club said:\n\nGreggs has enjoyed an excellent year despite the challenging economic environment. Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.\n\nThere is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.\n\nThis sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.\n\nKey to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless. And it is continually improving the offering.\n\nOverall, the future looks bright for Greggs and 2024 should be another year of progress.\n\n07:30 AM GMT\n\nGreggs reveals record year for profits and new stores\n\nHigh street bakery chain Greggs has cheered a record annual performance as it notched up a 27pc hike in full-year profits, but revealed slowing sales growth.\n\nThe group reported pre-tax profits of £188.3m in 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rose 13.7pc.\n\nIt saw sales growth slow to 9.4pc in the final three months of the year as there was less contribution from price inflation.\n\nThe group added that comparable store sales growth slowed further, to 8.2pc in the first nine weeks of 2024.\n\nBut the company said it was “confident that Greggs can deliver another year of good progress” and remains on track to open between 140 to 160 shops this year after opening a record 220 shops in 2023. Greggs opened a record 220 shops in 2023 - Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\n07:22 AM GMT\n\nAsia drives surge in bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s runaway rally is being driven by investors in Asia.\n\nTraders in South Korea, China and other Asian countries are responsible for roughly 70pc of bitcoin trading volumes, much like they were in 2021 when bitcoin last hit such heady highs, according to crypto exchange data from The Block.\n\nAsia accounted for $791bn of the $1.17 trillion worth of bitcoin traded in February, with North American investors lagging way behind with $113bn, broadly reflecting a trend seen since November, the data shows.\n\nIn China, FOMO (the fear of missing out) has gripped many small investors frustrated with an anaemic stock market. On popular messaging app WeChat, searches for “bitcoin” jumped 12-fold in February.\n\nMia Wang, a finance industry employee based in China’s eastern province of Zhejiang, told Reuters:\n\nI want to buy some bitcoin at a good price and hold.\n\nIt has jumped a lot and is expensive now, but I worry it won’t have any correction.\n\n07:19 AM GMT\n\nBitcoin surge risks creating a bubble, warns JP Morgan\n\nBitcoin’s surge that has taken it close to its record highs could be a bubble, a Wall Street investment bank has warned, as global stock markets also jumped to all-time peaks.\n\nJPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.\n\nBitcoin continued its ascent to a fresh two-year peak of $68,828 that put it within spitting distance of an all-time high.\n\nThere are also signs of wider exuberance across markets, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite all hitting record highs last week - and the Nikkei in Japan surpassing 40,000 for the first time on Monday.\n\nMr Kolanovic said: “Equities have moved up this year, even as bond yields rose and rate cut expectations unwound.\n\n“Investors may be assuming that the increase in yields is reflective of economic acceleration, but earnings projections for 2024 are coming down and the market appears too complacent on the cycle.”\n\nBitcoin has gained 50pc this year and most of the rise has come in the last few weeks after the approval of wider trading methods in the US.\n\nThe so-called spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds opened the way for new large investors and has reignited enthusiasm and momentum reminiscent of the run up to record levels in 2021.\n\nKyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com, said:\n\nIt’s crypto mania 4.0, and I think if we continue to see fairly low bond and rate volatility, it could keep going.\n\nThere’s definitely something of an irrational behaviour creeping into the market.\n\n07:13 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. Bitcoin has surged close to its record high and global stocks are also hitting fresh peaks - but a Wall Street bank is ringing alarm bells about the risk of a bubble.\n\nJPMorgan’s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is “froth building” in markets.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) IT chaos and staff exodus threaten Britain’s ability to raise crucial debt | Illegal activity in government bond auctions risks going undetected, a Parliamentary committee has warned\n\n2) Jaguar Land Rover owner to split off its cars division in EV shift | Tata Motors prepares for a future built around battery-powered vehicles\n\n3) Issa brothers slash investment at petrol station empire in battle to pay down debts | Billionaires roll out ‘controlled reduction’ at EG Group to maximise liquidity\n\n4) Non-dom tax raid risks backfiring on Hunt, warns IFS | New rules threaten to drive away super rich and diminish revenues, says think tank\n\n5) Ben Marlow: Britain must not bend the knee to China – despite being on the brink of a death spiral | There are less grubby ways to inject life back into our moribund stock market\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nMost Asian stocks slid as the start of China’s week-long annual session of parliament disappointed investors with its lack of big ticket stimulus plans to prop up the struggling economy.\n\nThe Chinese government retained last year’s target for economic growth of “around 5pc” for this year, and announced plans to run a budget deficit of 3pc of economic output, down from a revised 3.8pc last year.\n\nIt also unveiled plans to issue 1 trillion yuan (£109bn) in special ultra-long term treasury bonds, which are not included in the budget.\n\nMainland stocks reversed early losses with the blue-chip CSI 300 up about 0.5pc, amid signs of suspected state-backed buying of some exchange-traded funds.\n\nHowever, that failed to lift other markets in the region with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng deepening earlier declines to 2.7pc.\n\nTokyo’s key Nikkei index closed flat after hitting a fresh record the previous day as chip shares trimmed gains.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index was little changed, down 11.60 points to end at 40,097.63, while the broader Topix index climbed 0.5pc, or 13.65 points, to 2,719.93.\n\nUS shares edged down from their record heights in a quiet Monday on Wall Street.

        "content": "Larry Fink, who founded BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, in 1988 (initially under the purview of Blackstone), currently has a net worth of $1.2 billion. He serves as the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, which currently manages $8.7 trillion in total assets.\n\nFink has been a long-time advocate of equities investment, recommending investors put at least 80% of their total discretionary assets into equity investments or hard assets. Fink also stated that investors who have sufficient risk appetite could invest 100% of their total assets in equities.\n\nWhile Fink acknowledges the current macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds and their potential impact on the global equity market, the long-term trends are expected to remain positive, creating distinctive opportunities for investors.\n\n\"I think, you know, for a long-term investor, long-term view, who can tolerate market volatility, you should be at least 80 percent in equities or hard assets,\" Fink said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nLet's look at some of BlackRock's largest equity holdings.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is BlackRock's equity holding, accounting for 5.17% of the total portfolio. MSFT was one of the best-performing Magnificent Seven stocks in 2022, as the tech giant's strategic investments and acquisition plans reaped substantial earnings for the company. Year-to-date, shares of MSFT have gained nearly 10.5%.\n\nMicrosoft has been taking active steps to emerge as the market leader in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) space, as the company signed a 10-year strategic partnership agreement with British telecom company Vodafone Group last month.\n\nOver the next decade, Vodafone plans to allocate $1.5 billion towards the development of cloud and AI services focused on enhancing customer experiences in collaboration with Microsoft.\n\nAnalysts expect MSFT's revenues to increase 15.2% year-over-year to $60.86 billion in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ending March). The consensus EPS estimate of $2.83 for the ongoing quarter indicates a 15.5% improvement from the same period last year. Wall Street analysts expect MSFT's EPS to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3% over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Wedbush and Barclays have an \"Outperform\" rating on MSFT with a price target of $475, indicating a potential upside of up to 15%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Whole Foods' landlord has delivered a 15% net IRR for its investors since 2015. Check out the latest investment opportunities added to its platform.\n\nAmazon\n\nBlackRock holds approximately 627.17 million shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), accounting for roughly 2.42% of the total portfolio. The world's largest e-commerce player was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) on Feb 26, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance, reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy.\n\nAmazon is currently working on raising fees levied on businesses that sell their products on the platform, which could significantly increase its profit margins. The company generated $140 billion in revenues from sellers' fees in 2023, accounting for nearly 25% of the online retailer's total revenues.\n\nAmazon's net sales grew 14% year-over-year to $170 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, which ended Dec. 31, 2023. \"This Q4 was a record-breaking holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made a robust comeback in fiscal 2023 after a disappointing 2022. The company's focus on AI has driven its success last year, as it launched Llama 2, a state-of-the-art large language model for coding. Meta's founder and CEO highlighted last year as the year of efficiency for the company. BlackRock holds over 157 million shares of META, accounting for 1.42% of its total portfolio.\n\nMeta's revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $40.11 billion in fiscal 2023, while its net income rose 201% from the same period last year to $14.02 billion last year.\n\nFollowing its stellar earnings report, Meta authorized its first-ever dividend payment of $0.50 per share on Feb 1, pushing the stock to gain over 14% intraday. The company also authorized a share repurchase agreement of approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares and currently has nearly $31 billion earmarked for this purpose.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

There were more than 73,000 reports about Instagram at its peak and a smaller number of complaints about WhatsApp and Threads.\n\nThe outage extended to some of Meta’s business tools, such as its Ads Manager, the Meta Admin Center and Facebook & Instagram Shops. Even Workplace, Meta’s internal version of Facebook for employees, was disrupted, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nBy about noon, Meta said it had resolved the issue “for everyone who was impacted.”\n\nYouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., had more than 3,000 reports that service was down at around 10:30 a.m. but that number quickly declined.

        "content": "Cathie Wood has some ground to make up this year. The Ark Invest co-founder, CEO, and investor finds her most popular exchange-traded fund in the red in 2024, a bad look in a rising market. After trouncing the market last year, can she get back on track? She is not going to be standing still.\n\nWood kicked off this fresh trading week by adding to some of her existing positions and pruning some of her other stakes. She added to her Toast (NYSE: TOST), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and SoFi Technologies(NASDAQ: SOFI) shares on Monday. Let's take a closer look at these three purchases.\n\n1. Toast\n\nCathie Wood has a knack for buying some of her favorite stocks on dips, but this time she ordered a side of Toast when it was sunny side up. Shares of the company behind the popular point-of-sale system for eateries moved higher on Monday after an analyst initiated coverage with a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $32.\n\nToast has come a long way since taking a hit after offering weak near-term guidance following a mixed third-quarter report three months ago. The stock has soared 77% since bottoming out in late November, hitting a seven-month high on Monday after the bullish Wall Street pro nod. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe provider of cloud-based software solutions for the restaurant industry posted a 30% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter. It was just shy of the market's top-line expectations, but investors were relieved to see that it wasn't worse after Toast warned in November that transaction volume per eatery was trending negatively early in the quarter. Toast is making up for the industry lull by growing its reach.\n\nIts annualized recurring revenue run rate is now $1.2 billion, a 35% improvement from where it was at the end of 2022. Its adjusted gross profit and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose even higher. Toast also announced layoffs and a share buyback, signs that it's serious about cost controls as well as sensing value in its ascending shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt least six analysts would go on to jack up their price targets on the stock following the report. The stock still has a long way to go to return to its initial public offering (IPO) price of $40. Even the highest of analyst near-term price targets won't get Toast there. Wood doesn't mind waiting, and apparently it's not just Toast bent on buying its shares.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta is one of the biggest large-cap winners over the past year. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has more than quadrupled since the start of last year. Meta shares hit an all-time high on Monday.\n\nIt's been a pretty spectacular recovery for Meta. After more than a decade of consistent double-digit revenue growth, Meta's top line declined 1% in 2022. Investors figured that users and marketers were tiring of its social media applications, but it was just the lull it needed to refresh itself with an artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired boost to the digital advertising platform.\n\nMeta returned to double-digit revenue growth in 2023, fueled by four consecutive quarters of accelerating revenue growth. It's not just a top-line story here. Meta also landed ahead of analyst earnings estimates in all four quarters last year, boosting its guidance along the way. The stock may have more than quadrupled over the last 14 months, but Meta is somehow trading at a reasonable 25 times this year's projected earnings.\n\n3. SoFi Technologies\n\nShares of SoFi didn't follow Toast and Meta in hitting a near-term high on Monday. It's actually still trading lower this year, but that was after more than doubling in 2023.\n\nThere hasn't been any SoFi-specific news to account for the stock's slide. The last time that the digital banking and fintech provider had a financial update it was actually pretty good, posting well-received quarterly results near the end of January. It even came through with its first case of positive reported income, even though it has been in the black on an adjusted basis for 11 straight quarters now.\n\nSoFi's long-term outlook calls for 20% to 25% compound annual revenue growth over the next three years. The stock may have been kept in check this year once the timeline for rate cuts was extended deeper into 2024, but with an account base that has risen 44% over the past year you probably don't want to bet against SoFi.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Toast, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toast wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Brilliant Buys in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been some of the top performers in the market in recent years. This group consists of some of the largest companies listed in the U.S. markets. They are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOf the seven, I think only four are great buys right now. So, where does the split occur?\n\nI'm not a buyer of these three right now\n\nMicrosoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits.\n\nApple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year.\n\nThese two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.\n\nNvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four.\n\nThese four are much more attractive\n\nThat leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy. For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy.\n\nMeta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point.\n\nLastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.\n\nSome of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough.\n\nBut if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Considerably Cheaper and Not in a Bubble",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, Wall Street has enjoyed no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Innovations and high-interest trends such as the advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, China stocks, 3-D printing, cannabis, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, have captivated the attention, and wallets, of professional and retail investors.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is garnering more hoopla than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say \"AI,\" I'm referring to the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would typically undertake. The secret sauce to AI is machine learning, which allows these software and system to evolve over time and become more efficient at their tasks. Given that AI has application in virtually every sector and industry, it's not really a surprise that the analysts at PwC anticipate it could add a staggering $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.\n\nAlthough dozens of AI stocks have benefited from the early stages of the AI revolution, it's semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) that's truly become the face of the movement.\n\nDespite the early success of the AI revolution, Nvidia may be in a giant bubble\n\nThe way I regularly describe Nvidia's role is as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by businesses in high-compute data centers. Nvidia's GPUs are the foundation that allows for the split-second decision-making required of AI software and systems. The analysts at Citigroup have suggested that Nvidia could account for a 90% share of GPU's deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nWhat's been particularly beneficial for Nvidia is that demand for its high-powered AI chips has overwhelmed supply. It's enjoyed exceptional pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs, which is largely responsible for its skyrocketing data center sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, there are also reasons to believe Nvidia -- and potentially even the AI movement as a whole -- is in a sizable bubble. For instance, every next-big-thing trend over the past three decades has endured an early stage bubble. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nMore specific to Nvidia, it's set to face a monumental increase in external and internal competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have AI-focused GPUs they're rolling out this year to directly compete with Nvidia in high-compute data centers. Additionally, some of Nvidia's largest customers are developing AI chips of their own, which could lessen their future reliance on the current king of AI.\n\nNvidia also anticipates production for its A100 and H100 chips will increase, which would be expected to lessen AI-GPU scarcity. Since scarcity has been the company's core catalyst on the pricing front, it's quite possible Nvidia will cannibalize its own margins as its data center segment scales.\n\nInstead of putting your money to work in an AI stock that may very well be in a bubble at a multiple of 34 times last year's sales, consider investing in the following two AI stocks that aren't at risk of a collapse if history rhymes, once more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first AI stock that offers a considerably better value proposition than Nvidia and isn't at risk of a collapse if the AI bubble bursts is social media titan Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nMeta is using Ai in a variety of ways. It's monitoring comments on its various social sites for noncompliance, and giving businesses access to generative AI solutions that can help tailor their messages to individual users to (ideally) improve sales.\n\nWhile Meta's stock has undeniably enjoyed a hearty boost because of the AI revolution, many of the company's investments are geared at moving the needle years from now. It's why CEO Mark Zuckerburg has been perfectly content with Reality Labs losing more than $10 billion annually to further Meta's virtual/augmented reality and metaverse ambitions.\n\nWhat would ultimately protect Meta from an AI collapse is the company's top-notch social media real estate, which includes the most-popular social media platform on the planet, Facebook, along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, Meta's family of apps attracted almost 4 billion monthly active users to its sites during the December-ended quarter. Businesses realize that Meta's social sites reach the broadest audience, which is what typically affords the company exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nAnother reason investors don't have to worry about Meta being in a bubble is the company's cash flow and balance sheet. It closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and ultimately generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities for the year. Meta has the luxury of taking chances since its foundational business is a cash-printing machine.\n\nDespite crossing above the $500-per-share mark to end last week, Meta stock remains considerably cheaper than Nvidia. Shares can be picked up right now for 22 times forward-year earnings and roughly 13 times forecast cash flow in 2025. By comparison, Nvidia trades at nearly 28 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow for the following year.\n\nBaidu\n\nA second AI stock that's demonstrably cheaper than Nvidia and not at risk of collapse if the AI bubble were to burst is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Baidu has quite a few applications for artificial intelligence. The company's AI Cloud held the fourth-highest share of cloud infrastructure service spending in China, as of March 2023, based on estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service in the world, with more than 5 million accumulated rides since inception.\n\nDespite making aggressive investments in AI, Baidu's bread-and-butter operating segment continues to be its internet search engine. In January, Baidu accounted for approximately 60% of internet search within China, which was 44 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. With few exceptions, Baidu's search engine has sustained a 60% to 85% share of internet search for the world's No. 2 economy dating back nine years. This makes Baidu the logical go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s).\n\nBaidu should also benefit from the reopening of the Chinese economy following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three years of stringent and unpredictable lockdowns that attempted to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have led to sizable supply chain kinks in China's economy. These are steadily being worked out, which is good news for Baidu's revenue and profit trajectory.\n\nThe company also has a veritable treasure chest of cash to cushion any potential bubble-popping event in AI. Baidu closed out 2023 with more than $28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, which is more than enough capital to fuel innovation in all facets of its operations.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Baidu is historically cheap. Shares closed out the previous week at just 8 times forward-year consensus earnings and a little north of 7 times estimated cash flow in 2025. It makes for a smarter buy than Nvidia considering the history of bubbles associated with next-big-thing investment trends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For the most part, Reddit’s picks from 2021 haven’t panned out well at all over the long term. You probably aren’t going to find any standout stocks in the same place where you are finding fail videos and extremist political ramblings. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, closed at $4.36 on March 1, versus its 2021 high of nearly $500, while GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), finished at $14.95 on March 1, down from its 2021 high of $120.75. Another Reddit favorite from a few years ago, Bed, Bath and Beyond, even went bankrupt, while headphone maker Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) tumbled from its 2021 high of $127 to $2.50.\n\nEven Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) which has been relatively successful amid the resilience of crypto prices, is still trading well below its 2021 high of $369. Those stocks’ track records show that, over the longer term, powerful fundamentals and huge opportunities win out over bursts of popularity that are completely unjustified by fundamentals and reality-based outlooks. With that in mind, here are three stocks to buy that will indeed climb over the long term because their issuing firms have excellent businesses and great, easily converted opportunities.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is benefiting a great deal from its focus on helping its customers implement AI and shift to a mix of public and private clouds. As a result, it’s one of the best stocks to buy currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the firm’s Watsonx AI platform is proving to be quite popular, with more than 150 enterprioses, including Citi (NYSE:C), NASA, and Samsung, using the system as of last July.\n\nFurthermore, IBM has since made the platform more appealing by partnering with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, to allow its customers “to quickly and responsibly scale AI workloads by using a comprehensive stack of generative AI, which consists of Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx running on AWS Cloud and across hybrid cloud environments. ”\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more organizations greatly increase their use of AI, the growth of the firm’s Data & AI revenue will accelerate, Seeking Alpha columnist Uttam Dey recently predicted.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more than its share of skeptics in recent weeks, as bears have questioned whether the firm’s search engine can withstand challenges from AI chatbots and the answers provided by its own AI to certain questions offended some users.\n\nHowever, old habits are hard to break, so I predict that most users will continue to rely on Google’s search engine for many years to come. Furthermore, according to a majority of sources, Alphabet’s underlying AI technology is actually very strong.\n\nWhat’s more, the tech giant, which had nearly $111 billion of cash as of the end of last quarter, can afford to make acquisitions and hire many experts to greatly improve the quality of its AI offerings over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I’m confident that by 2030, Waymo will contribute considerable amounts to the firm’s top and bottom lines.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputer network equipment maker Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12, showing that it’s benefiting meaningfully from the AI boom.\n\nThe firm’s top line climbed by an impressive 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income rose to $513.6 million, up from $427.1 million in Q4 of 2022.\n\nAmong the company’s most prolific customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), which are also two of the largest beneficiaries of the AI Revolution. As MSFT and Meta continue to get big boosts from their deployment of AI, Arista’s financial results should continue to surge.\n\nAmong the 21 Wall Street analysts who cover the name, 13 rate it a “Strong Buy” and two have “Buy” ratings on it.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to advance to $7.59 this year and $8.56 next year from the $6.94 of EPS that it generated in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World.\n\nHumans are complex beings, gifted with a multitude of qualities-- some innate, others acquired through exposure. Precisely pinpointing a metric to measure their brilliance is a daunting task. The world is filled with awe-inspiring scientists who have shaped and reshaped our understanding of Earth, the cosmos and their multifarious dynamics, researchers who have brought forth astounding findings, politicians who have redrawn boundaries between countries and etched their mark in history, as well as artists and musicians who have brought immense pleasure to the world. The list of diverse accomplishments that humans can possess is endless. They are all stars, shining brilliantly in their respective domains.\n\nPreparing Generations of Brilliance\n\nThe students-- future pillars of all nations-- are unique individuals, each evolving along their path of knowledge. Over the years, significant emphasis has been placed on developing curricula that focus on critical thinking tools, participatory learning, and independent problem-solving techniques. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, in particular, has been hailed as the harbinger of future learning. Major countries like the US and Europe have predominantly incorporated it into their educational systems. However, with time, Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea, and Japan have also embraced this system. By 2020, China had emerged as the leading producer of STEM graduates, with 3.57 million, followed by India with 2.55 million and the US with 820,000 graduates.\n\nSTEM education is gaining even greater relevance in our technologically oriented world. The onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic and the global proliferation of educational apps have fostered an environment conducive to digital education. From 300,000 in 2011, the number of massive open online course learners has surged to 220 million in 2021. Additionally, numerous digital startups have emerged on the online education map, driven by the rise in US venture funding for Education Technology (EdTech). Notable companies, such as Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR), have played a pivotal role in this transformative landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) is an online platform that collaborates with over 300 universities and organizations, including prestigious institutions like Stanford, Duke, UC Berkeley, Dartmouth, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). The platform provides online courses, certifications, and degrees across various subjects. Aligning with the contemporary needs, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) CEO, Jeff Maggioncalda, explains how the company can assist students and professionals through adaptive and personalized learning experiences.\n\nResearch and Innovation Producing Brilliant Students\n\nWhile investing in strong schools and effective teaching tactics is crucial at the foundational level, the fast-paced, technologically oriented world demands an even greater emphasis on continuous research and upgrading. In the contemporary era, countries allocate millions to research to ensure rapid and up-to-date progress. The United States has emerged as the country with the highest spending on academic Research and Development (R&D). According to 2020 OECD data, the U.S. invested $81 billion in this sector, followed by Germany with $28 billion, the United Kingdom and Japan each with $20 billion, and France with $18 billion. The 27 European Union countries, including Germany and France, collectively spent $100 billion in the year 2020. American universities, like John Hopkins, University of California, San Francisco, and University of Pennsylvania, are spearheading the growth in the R&D sector. In 2022, R&D spending by academic institutions in the country reached $97.8 billion, marking an $8 billion increase from 2021. Thus, it is no wonder that the world’s leading technologically innovative companies, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), are situated in the U.S.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a technology pioneer for two decades, stands as one of the most widely used social media platforms globally. Originating from the mind of a brilliant psychology student at Harvard, the company swiftly captured the world's attention and continues to do so. With innovation as the cornerstone of their success, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently entered into a collaboration with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Together, they have formed an industry group comprising more than 40 companies and organizations, aimed at establishing open-source artificial intelligence work. This initiative is designed to facilitate technology sharing and reduce associated risks. 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World\n\n20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World, we have used the H-Index of the papers published in all the subject areas from the period of 1996-2022. H-Index is a robust measure of scholarly impact. We present our list in ascending order of H-Index. If you want to delve into the details of what H-index is, please refer to the methodology section in our piece on 15 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the World.

        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again under scrutiny as European consumer organizations take aim at Meta’s alleged illegal practices.\n\nEight groups from The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) have raised concerns about Meta’s data collection methods. They allege that the social media giant is facilitating a surveillance-based advertising system, disregarding user privacy and flouting data protection laws.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nOne startup funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and Homeland Security aims to solve this specific nuisance in a spectacular fashion, and you can invest in it today. This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\n\"With its illegal practices, Meta fuels the surveillance-based ads system, which tracks consumers online and gathers vast amounts of personal data for the purpose of showing them adverts. It is also the main way Meta makes its profits,\" according to the BEUC.\n\nIn November 2023, Meta gave users the choice to pay for an ostensibly ad-free service or consent to the company's full commercial surveillance with ads.\n\n\"We introduced this choice, called ‘Subscription for no ads', as our consent solution to comply with a unique combination of connected and sometimes overlapping EU regulatory obligations with differing compliance deadlines,\" Meta said.\n\nWhile Meta presented this as a solution to comply with EU regulatory obligations, BEUC deemed it unfair and misleading to users, adding to the mounting criticisms against the tech giant.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nThese recent filings add to the ongoing scrutiny Meta faces, with previous complaints already lodged against the company for misleading and aggressive practices. Leveraging the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and data protection laws, consumer advocates are intensifying their efforts to hold Meta accountable for its actions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has incurred many fines from European regulators.\n\nLast year, Meta was fined $1.3 billion for transferring data of users in Europe to the United States as regulators said the company failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European Union's highest court.\n\n\"The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organizations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences,\" said Andrea Jelinek, the chairwoman of the European Data Protection Board.\n\nIn addition to that, Meta was also previously fined €390 million ($423.3 million) for forcing users to accept personalized ads as a condition of using Facebook and another €265 million for a data leak.\n\nWith 408 million active users in the European Union, regulators are sending a clear message to Meta that serious infringements will have far-reaching consequences.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.

        "title": "Apple gets squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic",
        "content": "Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nJust as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.\n\nApple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\n\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make its last-ditch argument, according to those reports. Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.\n\nThe stock of Apple was down nearly 3% during morning trading, following the decision by the European Commission.\n\nThe EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nThose practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules. EU Commission vice president Margrethe Vestager addresses the media Monday at EU headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.\n\nThrough provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.\n\n\"Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\" the commission said in a summary of its findings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.\n\n\"The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,\" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services. An Apple store in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,\" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.\n\nApple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get \"limitless access\" to Apple's tools, free of charge.\n\nThe US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\nAny DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI",
        "content": "The AI Wave\n\nThe weather may be cold during winter, but stocks were scorching hot last month, fueled in part by the surge in performance from AI (Artificial Intelligence) stocks. More specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up +2.2% to 38,996. The S&P 500 surged +5.2% to 5,096. And the AI-heavy Nasdaq index climbed the most by +6.1% to 16,092.\n\nLeading the bull market brigade higher was NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which saw its stock launch higher by +29% for the month after reporting eye-popping quarterly revenues of $22 billion, more than tripling versus last year's comparable quarter. Customers of NVIDIA, like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are also benefiting from the rising tide of investor sentiment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nTo put this AI wave into perspective, you need look no further than to the comments made by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stated by the end of 2024, the company should have 350,000 of NVIDIA's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) as part of the company's AI infrastructure. At roughly $25,000 to $30,000 per GPU, the total cost is likely approaching $10 billion for just this one NVIDIA customer. Also, Dell Technologies' (NYSE:DELL) stock price opened more than +30% higher today after reporting quarterly financial results that exceeded forecasts due to robust demand for AI servers, which led to their backlog almost doubling in three months to $2.9 billion.\n\nWhen you have corporate America in addition to the large cloud data center providers (think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud) all battling to secure NVIDIA chips for their generative AI, machine learning initiatives, you can understand why NVIDIA's stock is up +250% in one year to a company value of $2 trillion. The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI\n\nJapan's Nikkei & Dow Both Break 39,000 Record Concurrently\n\nNot only did the Dow hit an all-time record high of 39,000 last month, but a stunning coincidence also occurred in Japan. The Nikkei 225, which is like the Japanese equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also hit a record high of 39,000 last month. What's the big difference between these two indexes simultaneously surpassing a record 39,000 in the same month?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt took the Nikkei over 34 years to surpass its previous record peak, which was last achieved in 1989 when Japan experienced a massive bursting of an asset bubble. On the other hand, it merely took the Dow just one month to break its previous recordnot four decades. Worth noting, so far in 2024, the Nikkei has been the world's best-performing major index surging 19%, almost triple the gain of the S&P 500 index.\n\nTax Time\n\nApril is fast approaching, which means it's that time of the year when Uncle Sam will come knocking on your door with your tax bill. Perhaps your taxes have already been prepaid and a refund is coming your way. Regardless, the goal of long-term investing is to master the art of maximizing returns and limiting taxes subject to your risk tolerance.\n\nHow does one create an investment masterpiece? One way to maximize return is to lower costs, including lower management fees, fund fees, and transaction costs. You can think of these investment costs as a leaky faucet. In the short-run, most people do not care about or are unaware of a leak.\n\nThe same principle applies to investment fees/costs. Investors can ignore these fees in the short-term, but over months or years, these costs can become enormous and destructive. I experienced this firsthand. Recently, normal monthly water bill was $40, but one leaky toilet resulted in an $800 monthly billouch! Just imagine what unknown leaky costs on your investments could mean for your retirement. Do you want high or unknown investment fees to delay your retirement by years? I think not. Focus on lower costs because quite simply, the less you pay, the more you keep, and the earlier you can retire.\n\nAnother way to maximize your investment performance is to benefit from the power of compounding. This phenomenon can only be achieved via the snowball-effect of long-term investing. This is why Albert Einstein called compounding the 8th Wonder of the World. At Sidoxia Capital Management, we have experienced this marvel on many of our investments, including our exponential gains in Amazon.com, which we first purchased in 2008 at s split-adjusted price of about $2.95 per share. The stock price recently closed at $177, a 60-fold increase from our initial purchase.\n\nThe risk-adjusted aspect of your nest-egg is also important because most people should consider decreasing risk as you more closely approach retirement age, especially if you are planning to tap your investments for liquidity. If risk wasn't a consideration, going to the Las Vegas roulette table and betting your life savings on black might be a good idea. Sure, you might have a chance of doubling your money instantly, but you could also lose it all in a blink of an eye.\n\nAnother way of thinking about risk, since we are in the heart of ski season, is to contemplate a ski instructor's advice for an 80-year-old beginner vs. an experienced Olympic downhill gold medalist. It wouldn't make sense for the 80-year-old beginner to train on the steep, advanced black diamond runs. Similarly, it wouldn't make sense for the gold-medalist Olympian to train on the flat beginner runs. The same concept holds true for investing. Young investors generally can take on more risk, while retirees often should be more conservative in their asset allocation, especially if they need liquidity from their investments to fund their living expenses and lifestyle.\n\nAlthough it would be nice to have ChatGPT create a luxurious retirement for you with a click of a button, unfortunately life is not that simple. You certainly can, and should, take advantage of the AI revolution in your investment portfolio to support your retirement goals, but successful investing requires more than that. With over 30 years of investment experience under my belt, at Sidoxia, we understand there are multiple facets to successful investing. In a diversified portfolio that that takes account of your risk tolerance, we strongly believe low-cost, tax-efficient, long-term investing is the best way to create your retirement masterpiece.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks, including NVDA, META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), but at the time of publishing had no direct position in DELL or any other security referenced in this article.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 12.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.27 per share, indicating a change of +61.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.1%. This estimate has changed +12.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.09 indicates a change of +15.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +14.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $36.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.9%. The $158.75 billion and $179.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.7% and +13.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 tech stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood. If you want to skip our discussion on Cathie Wood’s latest investment plays, head over to 5 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood.\n\nARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is adapting her investment strategy to navigate an anticipated deflationary period in 2024, focusing on innovation and technological advancements. She discussed this approach on CNBC's \"The Exchange\", emphasizing its relevance in the 2024 market landscape. Wood anticipates an aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, creating an economic environment where companies adept at deflation and dedicated to innovation can experience significant expansion. Wood's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF, witnessed a noteworthy 70% year-to-date increase in 2023. As the market stabilizes, ARK is diversifying its portfolio, considering the potential reopening of the IPO market and reintroducing previously sold names with improving outlooks.\n\nWood's strategy shift includes an increased focus on companies leading in AI and technology, exemplified by her renewed interest in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). She highlighted Meta's alignment with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's use of open-source AI. Wood also emphasized the transformative potential of gene editing technologies, particularly mentioning CRISPR Therapeutics, following the FDA approval of the first gene therapy using CRISPR CAS 9 for sickle cell disease. Despite early-stage pricing inefficiencies and cash-burn issues, Wood sees the gene editing sector as an attractive investment opportunity. In another noteworthy development, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) surpassed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and became ARK's top holding in Q4 2023.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, the hype around electric vehicles is just beginning. In the firm's recent \"Big Ideas\" report, Wood predicts that sales of new battery-powered cars could increase by a third each year, reaching 74 million in 2030, with autonomous driving capabilities. Despite approximately 10 million EVs delivered in 2023, the forecast suggests substantial growth. At an average selling price of $20,000 per EV, this could result in over $1.4 trillion in annual revenue potential for EV manufacturers. Wood believes these companies may capture a tenth of that as profit before interest and tax. The downside is a potential decline in demand for internal combustion engine cars, as global new vehicle sales are projected to be around 100 million in 2030. This shift may lead to a \"death spiral for incumbent auto manufacturers,\" warned ARK Invest. Wood gained prominence for her successful bets on Tesla, forecasting a target share price of $2,000 in 2027, primarily driven by Elon Musk solving autonomous driving challenges. Looking ahead to 2040, ARK Invest envisions a \"Cambrian explosion\" in battery technology applications, leading to the transformation of urban landscapes with the advent of flying taxis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in January 2024, Cathie Wood raised her bullish estimate for Bitcoin's price to $1,500,000 by 2030, a 50% increase from her previous prediction of $1 million. Wood attributed the increased likelihood of this optimistic scenario to the recent SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. According to her, this approval serves as a green light for the cryptocurrency. In a bear case, Wood anticipates a price of $258,500, while the base case is set at $682,800. ARK Invest supported its projections by pointing to factors such as a higher hashrate, long-term holder supply, and addresses with a non-zero balance.\n\nWhile Cathie Wood is bullish on innovation and disruptive technologies, some of the stocks to sell according to the ARK CEO include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Cathie Wood’s ARK portfolio for Q4 2023 and selected the technology stocks where she discarded her stake by at least 20% or more in the last quarter of 2023. We have arranged the list in the ascending order of the percentage of stake discarded. We have also assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). 12 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Investment Management\n\nTech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood\n\n12.

(NASDAQ:CHKP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\n\n“Check Point reported a solid Q4 as the company continues its lengthy transition towards a subscription-based sales model. We expect the firm to consistently repurchase shares with the substantial free cash flow it generates each year.”\n\n11. L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 37\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 20%\n\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) ranks 11th on the list of stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood.

(NYSE:LHX), down from 44 funds in the last quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) is a defense contractor focused primarily on communications, surveillance and electronic warfare. We anticipate the US’s defense budget will be better than expected over the next few years as the Defense Department focuses on preparing for peer-level threats — an area in which LHX’s capabilities fit nicely. We believe there is room for improvement in recent execution — particularly at recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne — and we think LHX’s new management team is well-qualified to improve results. We accordingly capitalized on a recent share-price decline to initiate a position at what we consider a compelling valuation.”\n\n10. Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 21%\n\nXerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX) is a global workplace technology company that integrates hardware, services, and software for enterprises worldwide.

Mark Coe’s Intrinsic Edge Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company.\n\n9. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 22%\n\nCyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) is one of the stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) develops and sells software-based security solutions and services.

(NASDAQ:CYBR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n“IT accounted for several of the greatest detractors from strategy performance during the fourth quarter. Among these were Paylocity Holding Corp. (PCTY), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) and Q2 Holdings, Inc. (QTWO).\n\nA cybersecurity company that operates globally, CyberArk specializes in products and services to protect and safeguard customers’ IT networks and devices. A recent flurry of buyouts by private equity firms has fostered an active rumor mill that’s at times produced rapid gyrations in the prices of cybersecurity stocks. We suspect CyberArk may have been the target of some of this speculation during the third quarter. Moreover, the growing slate of security products offered by cloud-computing giants Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google may have bruised investor sentiment toward the group.”\n\n8. Taboola.com Ltd. (NASDAQ:TBLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 23%\n\nTaboola.com Ltd.

Josh Goldberg’s G2 Investment Partners Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $11.3 million.\n\n7. PTC Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADSK) in Q4 2023. She owned 18,316 shares worth $4.46 million.\n\nOn February 20, Baird noted that Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) has an attractive business model, indicating a recommendation for investors to continue buying shares into fiscal years 2025 and 2026.

(NASDAQ:ADSK) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK): Autodesk was our next top detractor despite quarterly results reported in late May that were in line with expectations. For 1Q, revenue grew 12%, Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) grew 15%, and the company generated $714 million of FCF, which increased 69% year over year. Profitability for the company was strong, with a 32% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, and management reiterated its outlook for the year.\n\nAutodesk has a near monopoly on software for designing, building, and managing buildings, as well as software for infrastructure and manufacturing plants, prototyping software for manufacturers of products (including autos, machinery, and consumer products) and document sharing. As a result, we believe ADSK’s business is very sticky. The company expects to grow revenue mid-teens annually over the next several years, and, as we have seen in similar SaaS businesses, as revenue scales, operating margins are expected to expand significantly from their current 32% to more than 40%, more in-line with peers. We believe that ADSK shares can grow along with its mid-teens free cash flow growth over the next several years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n14 Social Security Spousal Benefits and Loopholes You Need to Know 25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, sold US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$502, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's stake.\n\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Meta Platforms shares. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth dumped US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Meta Platforms Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$175b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Meta Platforms Insiders?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Meta Platforms stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Meta Platforms is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms and we suggest you have a look.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. It expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nApple is gaining share in PCs which is positive.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.

Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption.\r\n\r\nPeople reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Intel have gained +65.9% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +163.3%.

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Has 27% of His Third Point Portfolio in 3 Brilliant \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, but Completely Sold Out of Another",
        "content": "Daniel Loeb is something of an iconic figure in the annals of Wall Street. The billionaire is CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb secured his place in investor history by starting Third Point with just $3 million in seed money -- collected from family and friends -- and parlaying that into a $6 billion financial empire. In 2022, Loeb made the list of the \"Best Hedge Fund Managers of All Time.\"\n\nSo when Loeb talks, Wall Street listens.\n\nOver the past year, Loeb's Third Point's holdings have been heavily weighted toward the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The common thread that unites these industry leaders is artificial intelligence (AI). They were also all among the top performers in the Nasdaq Composite last year:\n\nNvidia: up 239%. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): up 194%. Tesla: up 102%. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): up 81%. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): up 58%. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): up 57%. Apple: up 48%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLoeb has made no bones about the onset of generative AI, calling it \"transformative\" and saying \"profound economic upheaval\" coming. \"We believe generative and other forms of AI could compare to the Industrial Revolution but compressed into a period of months and years rather than decades,\" he said.\n\nLet's look at which Magnificent Seven stocks dominated his portfolio in the fourth quarter and which one he sold completely out of.\n\n1. Microsoft: 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft earned its place on Loeb's list thanks to a quick pivot to embrace AI. The company integrated AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its existing products and services. However, the biggest potential opportunity comes from its AI assistant, Copilot, which helps streamline and automate a variety of tasks, significantly enhancing worker productivity. Demand for the product has been robust.\n\nLoeb has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's worth noting that Loeb trimmed his position in Microsoft by more than 9% during the quarter -- but the position is actually larger than when the quarter began. Why? The stock jumped 19% during the fourth quarter, so even as Loeb took a little off the top, the total value of his Microsoft holdings grew.\n\nAt 34 times forward earnings, Microsoft might seem a little pricey, but given its pole position in AI, it's deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Amazon: 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb's stake in Amazon shouldn't be a surprise, as he's held the position for years. In early 2022, when the company's market cap was $1.6 trillion, Loeb stated that he believed there was more than $1 trillion in \"untapped value\" in Amazon. He estimates that its online retail business was worth more than $1 trillion alone, while its cloud infrastructure business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- was worth more than $1.5 trillion.\n\nFurthermore, Loeb has argued that \"the most direct consequence\" of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is that it \"will drive faster revenue growth\" for cloud infrastructure services providers -- including Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. He went on to say that such services \"are the 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit\" no matter who wins the AI revolution.\n\nLoeb trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% during the fourth quarter, but -- as with Microsoft -- the value of the position increased. This was thanks to Amazon's stock price gains of 20% during the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still very much a bargain.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: 6.2% of holdings\n\nIn keeping with Loeb's big bets on the Magnificent Seven and AI, he established a sizable position in Meta Platforms in the third quarter and added again in Q4. Meta's ties to AI are well established, as the company has long used these advanced algorithms to help target its advertising while surfacing relevant content for users on its various social media sites. Furthermore, the recovery of the advertising market is still ongoing, representing additional upside potential for Meta.\n\nThere's also Meta's foray into generative AI with its Large Language Model Meta AI, which is available on all the major cloud platforms. This represents a new source of revenue for the company.\n\nWhile he hasn't explained his reasoning, Loeb obviously believes the stock is still a good value. While not addressing Meta specifically, Loeb's penchant for \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations\" is well documented. Indeed, Meta Platforms stock was selling for 24 times earnings to close out 2023, a discount to the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.\n\n4. Alphabet: 0% of holdings\n\nLoeb closed out of his entire position in Alphabet, selling all 900,000 shares of Class A stock valued at roughly $125 million at the end of the quarter. Loeb has been mum as to his mindset, but broader portfolio shifts might provide some insight. In addition to Alphabet and trimming his Microsoft and Amazon holdings, Loeb significantly reduced his stake in other technology stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intercontinental Exchange, and Uber, among others. At the same time, the billionaire investor initiated positions in several utilities, including Verizon and Vistra, while increasing his stake in Pacific Gas & Electric. This suggests Loeb was rebalancing his portfolio and saw greater opportunities in utility stocks, particularly given the epic run in tech stocks over the past year.\n\nTo be clear, I believe Loeb made a mistake selling out of Alphabet. It stands to benefit from the advertising rebound and the same AI tailwinds that will drive the other Magnificent Seven stocks higher. Furthermore Alphabet is selling at just 24 times earnings, a fair discount to the market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "To those caught in the still-inflating \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stock bubble, it's a worthy endeavor to remember there are 493 other potential equities to invest in within the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nIndustrials, healthcare, and more are there for the picking!\n\nAnd outside of the S&P 500, there could be great investing opportunities in private equity, Treasurys, and hey, maybe even classic cars, if that's your thing.\n\nPut it all together, and this is what's known as diversification— a tried-and-true wealth-building approach tested by millionaires and billionaires alike, life and business strategist Tony Robbins touted.\n\n\"I would just say maintain diversification. We all heard it a million times,\" Robbins told Yahoo Finance at its New York City headquarters (see video above).\n\nThe six-foot-six author, who recently released \"The Holy Grail of Investing,\" says it's a reminder served up by longtime friend and vaunted investor, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. By diversifying, an investor can better reduce correlations between investments — and bring down the potential risk.\n\nKnown for his ultra-high-energy seminars, Robbins, who has a reported net worth of more than $600 million, warned against the AI hype bubble.\n\n\"I am concerned about it as well,\" Robbins said about investors' infatuation with Magnificent Seven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThe diversification reminder couldn't come at a better time as the Magnificent Seven trade has become hyper-correlated and is mostly moving in a singular direction — up and to the right.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven now makes up some 30% of the S&P 500's market cap, in part powered by a hearty reaction to AI chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report a week ago. Said market reaction has Wall Street analysts tripping over themselves to ratchet up profit forecasts, essentially feeding more upward momentum in the group's stock prices.\n\nStory continues Life and business strategist Tony Robbins (left) reminds investors that diversification is important in an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (right). (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the past three months, Magnificent Seven earnings estimates have been revised higher by a lofty 7%, with its margins going up by 86 basis points, said Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nThe average Magnificent Seven stock is up 14% this year, according to Yahoo Finance calculations. Nvidia has led the way with a 60% advance, while Tesla (TSLA) has dropped 23%.\n\nOver the past year, two of the Magnificent Seven companies have seen triple-digit-percentage gains — Nvidia at 239% and Meta (META) at 184%. The S&P 500 is up a very respectable 29% during that time.\n\nSome on the Street are finally beginning to call a timeout on the Magnificent Seven, with reasonable explanations that a reasonable investor should ponder.\n\n\"Elevated expectations and concentrated positioning create a high bar for the Magnificent 7 to beat,\" strategists at JPMorgan Asset Management contended in a new client note. \"AI will be investable for the long-haul and its beneficiaries will include far more than chipmakers.\"\n\nThey added that a soft economic landing and declining interest rates later this year stand to \"bode well for a catch up\" by sectors and companies left behind in last year's rally.\n\nAn argument could be made that not every Magnificent Seven member delivered blowout fourth quarters and outlooks to justify their stock's near-record valuation. Tony Robbins quote\n\nApple's (AAPL) performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), it missed estimates on ad revenue, the core of its business. Tesla's quarter and its Elon Musk-led earnings call were littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — in the near term — that all its AI efforts are going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta's quarter was okay — but it also jacked up its 2024 capital expenditures a ton, which could weigh on margins and cash flow.\n\nThe quarters out of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia have been universally seen as huge.\n\n\"I've done everything in my life by saying success leaves clues. Find the best in the world. Figure out exactly what they do, do the same thing, and your chances of success go up a hundredfold,\" Robbins said.\n\nThe best investors in the game stay diversified — and not by buying seven tech companies that, at times, compete for the same customers.\n\nGive it a thought.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Wagering on tech stocks involves investing in the vanguard of AI innovation, a sector poised to redefine our digital future. As businesses globally harness the power of AI to push the boundaries of what’s possible, tech stocks emerge as gateways to participate in the next revolution in tech. The fascination with these stocks continues to grow as AI unfolds its transformative power across multiple industries, signaling a new era of digital evolution.\n\nThe shift towards AI-driven technologies marks a major step-change reminiscent of the internet’s explosive growth in the mid-90s. Moreover, Wedbush Securities disagrees with the AI bubble argument, pointing to a foundational shift in the tech sphere, with AI at the forefront. Hence, it’s arguably the best time for investors eyeing tech stocks to back companies shaping an AI-driven future in our daily lives and work.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) never ceases to amaze with its innovative prowess and evolving ability. Due to its pioneering advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout 2023, MSFT stock saw an incredible 58% uptick in value. That wasn’t merely a fleeting success, as it looks to layer AI into its timeless software suite.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, Microsoft’s impressive financials are already benefitting from its AI investments. That shows in its recent quarterly showing, where it posted a stellar $890 million top-line beat and a 16 cents per-share earnings beat. The integration of ChatGPT-like functions into Bing and the Office365 suite, along with the launch of Microsoft 365 Copilot, points to a massive growth runway ahead for the firm. Additionally, the estimates of direct and indirect sales boosts from AI products, including a potential $10 billion incremental annual sales from Copilot, underscore Microsoft’s growth prospects. Given these dynamics, MSFT stock remains one of the top tech stock picks, offering immense upside potential ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a storied player in enterprise software and cloud services, is making significant inroads in the AI space. Its focus on AI cloud infrastructure is a game-changer, likely to increase cost efficiencies for its clients significantly. The company’s latest quarterly showing underscores this direction, with cloud revenues surging 25% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.8 billion, marked by a notable 52% jump in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nMoreover, it is expanding its AI cloud positioning by expanding its global footprint with the construction of 100 new data centers for Microsoft while enhancing 66 existing ones. Its enriched AI portfolio, accessible through its cloud marketplace, is a testament to its forward-looking approach towards democratizing AI tools for businesses globally. With such dynamic growth and strategic positioning, Tipranks’ analysts point to an 11% upside in ORCL stock from its current price while assigning a Moderate Buy rating.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNew York-based global payments giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) wrapped up another impressive year, thriving on the back of rising interest rates. Demonstrating robust financial health, it recently posted its fourth-quarter (Q4) results, with an 11% bump in sales from the prior year and a remarkable 23% surge in net income to $1.93 billion. That performance is a testament to the resilience of consumers, who remained unfazed amid non-essential cutbacks. Hence, for fiscal year 2023, American Express notched a record sales figure of $60.5 billion, achieving 14% growth in EPS to $11.21, buoyed by higher retail credit card rates and consumer spending.\n\nConsequently, the firm announced a generous 17% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 70 cents per share. Looking ahead, the management remains optimistic, projecting a revenue growth of 9% to 11% for fiscal 2024, with anticipated EPS ranging between $12.65 and $13.15. That outlook underscores American Express’ strategic positioning for sustained growth and long-term profitability.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a powerful AI, and it presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Picking up from where it left off last year, Meta Platforms continued to shine in 2024, marked by four consecutive quarters of top-and-bottom-line beats. In its most recent quarter, it announced its first-ever dividend and $40.1 billion in sales, which surpassed estimates by $940.6 million.\n\nFurthermore, Meta’s maverick CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is deeply invested in AI. His investment in the sphere is shown by Meta’s development of its in-house Artemis AI chip and board additions like Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) Hock E. Tan and John Arnold. Also, his competitive stance is further illustrated in his challenge to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the lucrative metaverse-gear space, highlighting the Quest 3 VR headset’s affordability and superiority over Apple’s pricier Vision Pro VR headset. That move not only showcases Meta’s competitive positioning but also its ambition to lead in the adoption of AI and the metaverse.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a bellwether in the streaming sphere, which continues to outperform in a competitive sector. With an array of content that spans movies, TV shows and documentaries, the streaming giant has maintained its growth trajectory despite competitive pressures. Introducing new players during the pandemic did little to shake its stronghold. Instead, Netflix continues to expand its subscriber base at a healthy pace.\n\nIn its Q4 earnings report, Netflix posted a commendable 13% YOY increase in total revenue and subscriber numbers. Moreover, in the past four consecutive quarters, it has beaten earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. However, in Q4, it fell short by 11 cents, on its bottom line.\n\nNevertheless, its growth trajectory mirrors its results during the pandemic’s peak, mainly due to the company’s successful crackdown on password sharing. NFLX stock is up over 40% in the past six months alone, and its exciting content lineup positions it for further gains.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco.

The company recently unveiled AI-driven products, such as its Einstein Copilot. The Einstein Copilot is the company’s new generative AI-powered conversational assistant, developed to enhance every Salesforce application.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s financial performance speaks volumes, with its Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.29, besting analyst estimates by two cents. Also, revenue saw a healthy 10.9% YOY increase to $9.29 billion, surpassing forecasts by $70 million. Notably, subscription and support revenues climbed to $8.75 billion, marking a 12% YOY growth.\n\nMoreover, the company initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share and a significant increase in its share repurchase program by $10 billion. As we advance, the company sets its full-year fiscal 2025 sales guidance between $37.7 billion and $38.0 billion, indicating an 8% to 9% growth YOY.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nECommerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is on a remarkable growth trajectory, with its latest quarterly results showing significant gains bolstered by holiday sales. Consequently, AMZN is up roughly 11% this month and 30% in the past six months.\n\nAmazon’s success lies in its diversified business model, which covers multiple tech verticals, including advertising, cloud computing, subscription services and other areas. That diversification has yielded substantial sales from its eCommerce operations and its cloud computing juggernaut in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is leveraging AI to solidify its leadership in the cloud sector. With its massive internal reserves, Amazon is looking to go full-steam ahead with its commitment to AI innovation through advanced computing chips, including Graviton4 and Trainium2. AWS continues to shine financially, with its sales up 13% YOY to $24.2 billion and advertising revenue growing 27% to $14.7 billion. Also, its eCommerce segment witnessed a 14% increase. Hence, Amazon’s dominance in the market is clear, offering tremendous upside to investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The decision can be appealed by Mark Zuckerberg's tech company.\n\nThe Barueri-based firm Meta Servicos, which registered its brand in the late 2000s with Brazils's National Institute for Intellectual Property, said in the judicial process that since Zuckerberg's company changed its name in 2021, it had been wrongly included in more than 100 lawsuits and had Instagram profiles disabled for supposedly impersonating another.\n\nAn appeals court in Sao Paulo ruled that U.S. Meta must pay 100,000 reais ($20,201) per day if it fails to comply with the decision.\n\nThe company, formerly called Facebook, changed its name in a rebrand that focused on building the \"metaverse,\" a shared virtual environment that it bet would be the successor to the mobile internet.\n\n($1 = 4.9503 reais)\n\n(Reporting by Alberto Alerigi Jr. and Patricia Vilas Boas in Sao Paulo; additional reporting and writing by Andre Romani; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

        "content": "Friday, March 1, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Intel Corp. (INTC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +24.0%). The company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. It expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nApple is gaining share in PCs which is positive. Apple’s strong cash balance and shareholder friendly approach to dividend and share repurchase is noteworthy. However, growing legal complexities has been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+181.1% vs. +73.1%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption.\r\n\r\nPeople reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Intel have gained +65.9% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +163.3%. The company is focusing on establishing an advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and has expanded global production capabilities under its IDM 2.0 (integrated device manufacturing) strategy.\r\n\r\nIt remains on track with its 5N4Y (five nodes in four years) program in order to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel has launched AI chips for data centers and PCs to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector and ubiquitous edge environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, weak demand trends and sluggish recovery in China are affecting its revenues. Macroeconomic challenges, inventory adjustments and intense market volatility are straining margins. Stiff competition in the server, storage and networking markets has hurt its long-term growth potential to some extent. For the first quarter of 2024, Intel has offered muted guidance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR), Diamondback Energy, Inc. (FANG) and ICON Public Limited Co.

        "title": "Nasdaq ETF Logs Best Month Since 2015: 5 Top Stocks",
        "content": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index wrapped up the best month in nearly a decade. It reached a new record close for the first time in over two years, buoyed by optimism about artificial intelligence. The Nasdaq is the last of Wall Street's three major stock indices to reach a record-high close. For the month, the Nasdaq gained 6.1%.\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ QQQ, which serves as a proxy to the Nasdaq Index, gained 2.7% last month. As such, we have highlighted the five best-performing stocks of QQQ from last month that led the way higher in the portfolio. These include Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. GEHC, Meta Platforms META and Applied Materials AMAT.\r\n\r\nTotal fourth-quarter earnings of the 402 S&P 500 members who have reported results so far increased 4.9% from the prior-year period on 3.4% higher revenues. Of the companies that reported results, 78.6% beat EPS estimates and 64.4% surpassed revenue estimates. The pace of earnings and revenue growth represents an acceleration from the last couple of quarters, with the technology sector being a major contributor to this improving trend.\r\n\r\nInvestors should note that the tech sector is solely responsible for keeping Q4 earnings growth in the positive territory. The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been the biggest engine of growth and its earnings are on track to be up 48.7% year over year on 14.5% higher revenues (read: Momentum ETFs Hit New 52-Week Highs).\r\n\r\nEasing inflation and an improving economy provide a nice boost to the tech sector. Per the latest data, consumer prices increased at their slowest rate in nearly three years, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. Hopes of cutting interest rates later this year have added to the strength. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low.\r\n\r\nFurther, the appeal for stocks geared toward consumer services increased, making consumer discretionary the best-performing sector last month.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.\n\nStory continues\n\nQQQ in Focus\n\nInvesco QQQ provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Information technology accounts for 50.5% of the assets, while communication services and consumer discretionary make up for a 15.6% and 13.6% share, respectively (read: Global ETF AUM Hits $11.7 Trillion: What's Driving the Surge?).\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $252.6 billion and an average daily volume of around 40.3 million shares. Invesco QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.\r\n\r\nBelow, we have highlighted the abovementioned five stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket.\n\nTop-Performing Stocks in QQQ\n\nConstellation Energy generates and markets electricity.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 1, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and Amazon AMZN.\n\n\"It's a Bull Market You Know\": Top-Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend\n\nThis article's title, \"It's a bull market you know!\" is a quote from a famous investing book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, which accounts the life of famous speculator Jesse Livermore.\n\nThe book, which is a must read for any stock trader, details the wins and losses of Livermore's volatile life and shares many of his formative learning experiences. One of his earlier lessons occurred while he was hanging out at a brokerage firm he traded with. There he met a market veteran who went by the name Old Turkey.\n\nUp until this period Livermore was a very active trader, buying and selling shares at a high frequency, sometimes multiple times during the day. But this phrase from Old Turkey \"It's a bull market you know!\" stuck with Livermore.\n\nOld Turkey would repeat it over and while at first, he thought it was just a platitude he learned that it held much deeper insights than that. Instead of trading in and out of stocks, taking profits and waiting for a dip to buy again, this phrase was an encouragement to hold on to you winners for as long as possible.\n\nPersisting Bull Market\n\nBull markets often endure much longer than investors expect. In fact, the US stock market spends the vast majority of time in bull markets that steadily grind higher, climbing a wall of worry.\n\nThis insight deeply changed the way Livermore approached the market. Instead of quick profits he now focused on the big trends and owning the leading stocks for as long as the bull market persisted.\n\nAlthough Livermore's trading was marked by wild boom and busts, it was his overuse of leverage that was his Achilles heel. In fact, he would make huge profits riding these longer-term bull moves and occasional bear markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Market\n\nThe current market regime is one that has a litany of bullish tailwinds, and we are likely closer to the beginning of this bull market than the end. The factors include:\n\n- AI revolution: The hype is real – AI tech could be as influential as the internet has been and will make major contributions to productivity gains.\n\n- Strong economic growth: The US economy is showing above trend growth surprising nearly all economists on wall street.\n\n- Interest rate cuts: It won't be long before the Fed begins to lower rates again, beginning the expansionary cycle again.\n\nLeading Stocks\n\nOften, as a stock makes incredible gains, you will hear very loud voices talking about how \"it has gone too far!\" Just look at the commentary surrounding Nvidia, these traders have been saying this month after month, yet the stock pushes higher.\n\nLeading stocks lead for a reason, and in this current market they are leading because of growing sales and earnings. That is the opposite of hype and exactly what you want to see strong stocks do.\n\nAfter a little more than a year of using the Zacks Rank I have been continuously impressed by its ability to pick big winners. Nvidia and Meta Platforms sat on the list for the majority of 2023, when most analysts doubted them, yet they were the biggest winners in the S&P 500.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks sitting on the Zacks Rank right now that have performed very well recently and I think are likely to continue. They represent the secular economic trends of this economy, have strong business models, growing earnings and of course top Zacks Ranks.\n\nMeta Platforms and Nvidia are still on the top of the list, and both enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS for Nvidia are forecast to grow an incredible 30% annually for the next 3-5 years and Meta's are projected to climb 20% annually over the same period.\n\nThey also continue to show impressive relative strength against the market YTD.\n\nAnother company that is quietly making a significant contribution to the semiconductor and AI industry is Cadence Design Systems. The company builds software for designing chips and leads the space.\n\nSoftware within the semiconductor industry is a particularly appealing vertical. Semiconductor production is a very high capex intensive business, while software is a high margin low capex business. Candence Design enjoys gross margins of 90% and net margins of 26%.\n\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, CDNS also has a compelling technical trade setup. The price action of the stock has been forming a bullish consolidation, and a breakout should send the stock higher.\n\nAmazon is another leader that is likely to continue to lead. Both the ecommerce business and cloud services boast massive tailwinds with the expansion of online retail and digital transformation. Amazon web services dominates the cloud industry with 31% of the market share.\n\nAdditionally, its advertising business has exploded from seemingly nowhere and now contributes $60 billion a year to the top line annually. The emergence of this business shows that Amazon continues to execute at a high level as it enters new highly competitive industries.\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates are being upgraded significantly and EPS are expected to grow at a very high pace over the next 3-5 years. Earnings are projected to grow 28% annually over that time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere will be hiccups along the way, 5% and 10% corrections as the market continues higher, but don't let the bears scare you out of this market.\n\nIt's a bull market you know!\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Meta Platforms Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.96 billion people on a monthly basis as of Sep 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nNewly introduced metric, which is the family daily active people (DAP) that measures daily users of its family of products, was 3.14 billion, as of Sep 30. \r\n\r\nMeta uses metrics like daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) to measure Facebook’s user base. As of Sep 30, 2023, DAUs and MAUs were 2.085 billion and 3.049 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $116.61 billion in 2022. Advertisement accounted for 97.5% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\r\n\r\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\r\n\r\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\r\n\r\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\r\n\r\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\r\n\r\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.\r\n\r\nMeta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2014 would be worth $7,159.36, or a gain of 615.94%, as of March 1, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 174.07% and gold's return of 48.34% over the same time frame.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for META.\n\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 24.15%, and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has gained 7% within the first two months of 2024, and it won't be surprising to see it jump higher as the year progresses, thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI stocks have played a big role in boosting the Nasdaq-100 in the past year, sending the index up nearly 54% as its components, such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), have delivered stunning gains of 233% and 181%, respectively. History suggests that the Nasdaq-100 tends to jump 24% on average following a year in which it achieved gains of 40% or more.\n\nSo, it won't be surprising to see the Nasdaq jump higher in 2024, especially considering the latest results from Nvidia and Meta Platforms. Let's look at the reasons why these two tech giants are all set to boost the Nasdaq and also check why now will be a good time to buy them.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's stock market rally got a nice boost after the company released fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 28, 2024) on Feb. 21. The chipmaker cruised past consensus estimates with record quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, a jump of 265% from the year-ago period.\n\nThe company was originally expecting its fiscal Q4 revenue to land at $20 billion. However, its efforts to increase the supply of its flagship H100 AI graphics processing unit (GPU) to meet the robust demand from customers helped it deliver stronger-than-anticipated growth.\n\nThat's not surprising as Nvidia's foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, has been aggressively increasing its advanced packaging capacity so that it can churn out a greater number of AI chips. Supply chain sources indicate that TSMC's chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) manufacturing capacity, which is used for making AI chips, is set to expand to 33,000 to 35,000 wafers a month by the fourth quarter of 2024. That would be more than double TSMC's estimated monthly CoWoS capacity of 15,000 wafers in December 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the supply of its AI graphics cards is improving. But what's interesting to note here is that Nvidia expects the demand for its GPUs to outpace supply despite the efforts it is undertaking to produce more chips. According to CFO Colette Kress, the company expects its \"next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\n\nNvidia will start ramping up the shipments of its next-generation H200 AI GPU in the second quarter. The company is claiming that this chip \"nearly doubles the inference performance of H100,\" which doesn't seem surprising as it is expected to be manufactured using a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) chipmaking process as compared to the H100's 5nm process. Moreover, Nvidia is packing the H200 with more memory bandwidth and capacity.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia seems to be in a solid position to maintain its impressive share of the $67 billion AI chip market in 2024. Gartner estimates that $53 billion worth of AI chips were sold last year, and Nvidia's data center revenue of $47.5 billion indicates that it controlled 90% of this market last year. A similar share this year can help Nvidia sustain its momentum, which explains why its fiscal 2025 revenue is expected to increase 83% to $110 billion. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe market could reward such impressive growth with more upside. With shares of Nvidia trading at 33 times forward earnings, which is lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 34, investors would do well to buy this AI stock right away since its bull run seems here to stay.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nJust like Nvidia, Meta Platforms is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings. Buying Meta stock at this valuation looks like a no-brainer, considering that its bottom line is expected to jump an impressive 34% in 2024 to $19.91 per share. Even better, analysts are anticipating Meta's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 26% for the next five years, a big improvement over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years.\n\nAssuming Meta can achieve this pace of bottom-line growth, its earnings could increase to $47.22 per share after five years, using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base. If we multiply the projected earnings after five years with Meta's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 21, its share price could increase to $991. That would be a solid jump of 105% from current levels.\n\nAI is a key reason why Meta should be able to deliver the solid earnings growth that analysts are expecting from it. The company has been integrating generative AI into its advertising tools to help advertisers improve targeting and generate stronger returns on the advertising dollars they spend. From helping advertisers create multiple backgrounds for their ad campaigns based on product images to generating ad texts, Meta believes that its Ads Manager platform can \"unlock a new era of creativity that maximizes the productivity, personalization and performance for all advertisers.\"\n\nMeta points out that using generative AI in advertising has the potential to help advertisers save five or more hours every week while also boosting returns on ad spending by 32%. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Meta cornering a bigger share of the digital ad market, similar to what it did last year. The company's 2023 revenue increased by 16% to $134.9 billion, outpacing the 10.7% increase in digital ad spending.\n\nThis year, analysts are forecasting a 17.3% increase in Meta's revenue to $158.2 billion, suggesting that it is on track to outpace the 13.2% projected growth in digital ad spending, as per eMarketer. The digital ad market is expected to jump to an estimated $1.5 trillion in 2030 as compared to $531 billion in 2022.

        "title": "5 Tech Giants to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Nasdaq Thrives",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4%, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle in January, although finally, it closed the first month of 2024 on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index regained momentum in February finishing the month with a 6.1% rally. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% compared with a 7.5% gain of the S&P 500 and 3.4% of the Dow. Notably, all three major stock indexes saw the fourth consecutive month of positive ending.\n\nMeanwhile, on Feb 29, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to close at 16,091.92, marking its first closing record since November 2021. Its peers the Dow and the S&P 500 posted several all-time highs on both an intraday and a closing basis in the first two months of this year. Now, the tech-heavy index has joined the bandwagon.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — along with a solid outlook provided by management, raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. (TSM) — the world's largest contract chipmaker — has projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales will reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite-listed technology behemoths namely NVIDIA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nMoreover, each stock’s long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate is well above the market’s benchmark S&P 500’s current long-term growth rate of 11.6%. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips in China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, implying an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com has benefited from the Prime and AWS’s momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 28.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid its growth. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms reported fourth-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.35%. The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. META expects total revenues between $34.5 billion and $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicrosoft has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT were driven by the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. SMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI emphasizes superior product design and uncompromising quality control to produce industry-leading serverboards, chassis and server systems.\n\nThese Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations. SMCI sells its server systems and components primarily through distributors, which include value-added resellers and system integrators, and to a lesser extent, to original equipment manufacturers.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Super Micro Computer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of more than 100% and 83.8%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 55.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Apple the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" are some of the most dominant businesses in the world. As a result, their shares, which have soared in price in recent times, are in many investors' portfolios.\n\nAt its current market cap of $2.8 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) doesn't need an introduction. The maker of popular hardware and software products is a financially lucrative enterprise. And its stock has climbed 316% in the last five years, crushing the returns of the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nApple is also Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far. But is it the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now?\n\nLow growth, high price\n\nApple isn't putting up growth numbers like it used to. Revenue increased by 2.1% in its fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, but dropped in each of the four previous quarters. On average, Wall Street analysts expect sales to rise at an annualized clip of 4.2% over the next three fiscal years.\n\nThat's hardly any reason to get excited. In fact, it puts Apple dead last when compared to the other Magnificent Seven businesses. The other six are forecast to post much faster top-line growth, according to consensus analyst estimates.\n\nBlame it on macro headwinds or consumers no longer feeling the need to upgrade to the newest Apple device as often. But investors are probably smart not to expect double-digit percentage revenue gains from Apple anymore.\n\nHowever, the stock trades as if strong growth is a foregone conclusion. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.2 is a huge premium compared to its trailing-10-year average of 21. This is a stock that's best kept on the watch list for now, in my opinion.\n\nDigital ad giants\n\nOf all the Magnificent Seven stocks, I believe two stand out as the best to buy right now. I'm talking about the giants in the digital ad market: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nGrowth isn't a concern for these internet enterprises. Alphabet reported revenue of $307 billion in 2023, up 8.7%, while Meta's sales climbed 15.7% to $135 billion. Because the global digital advertising industry has many years of expansion ahead, these two businesses are poised to remain major beneficiaries. Combined, they command nearly 60% of the worldwide digital advertising market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that both Alphabet and Meta possess powerful competitive advantages, the most notable of which are their network effects. Alphabet's Google Search and YouTube are incredibly popular internet services that get better with more information, content, and users, as are Meta's various social media apps -- a situation that makes things extremely difficult for their smaller rivals.\n\nIn the last five years, Alphabet and Meta have averaged operating margins of 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively. Plus, they both produce ridiculous amounts of operating cash flow, giving them the financial resources to invest aggressively in artificial intelligence capabilities, while at the same time repurchasing a lot of their outstanding shares.\n\nInvestors are being asked to pay forward P/E multiples of just 20.3 for Alphabet and 24.1 for Meta. By that metric, they are the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, which makes them no-brainer investments in my book.\n\nWhile Apple is surely one of the highest-quality companies in the world, its current setup doesn't position it favorably to deliver market-beating long-term returns. Based on their attractive business characteristics and compelling valuations, Alphabet and Meta are the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.
